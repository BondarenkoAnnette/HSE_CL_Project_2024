0,"(InStyle.com) -- Daring in her fashion choices and her roles -- this summer she plays Agent 99 in ""Get Smart"" -- Anne Hathaway is the perfect candidate to answer questions about developing your own unique personal style. Anne Hathaway wears a Valentino satin coat and La Crasia leather gloves at an InStyle photoshoot. Curvaceous and kooky, interesting and interested, Hathaway is a multidimensional gal. In an age of nonstop tabloid exhibitionism, she stands out as a beacon of confident allure. Within a short period of time, the young actress has graduated from fashion ingénue to a woman who navigates the designer realm with intrepid spirit and lashings of wit. Now that she has her bearings, Hathaway is ready to express her individuality.  Watch how Anne Hathaway changes her style » . She arrives for our meeting looking well scrubbed, bohemian and totally incognito: Her navy jacket is from Et Vous in Paris; the jeans, True Religion; the flats, Lanvin; and the bag, Anya Hindmarch. An Yves Saint Laurent lapis lazuli ring and Ugandan handcrafted beads from Beadforlife.org are all the embellishment she needs. It seems to me that nowadays some stars confuse being stylish with dressing really slutty. What's your take?  I've always been on the conservative side when it comes to showing skin. I'm from that school where you show one part of your body, not all of it. So compared to the girls you're talking about, I'm quite prim... [But] sometimes you just make mistakes. I once wore a see-through dress to an event, but I had absolutely no idea ...  You didn't do the lighting test!   And I have never not done the lighting test after that. At the end of the day, you have to dress in what you're comfortable in. If you're at ease in a bikini top and a miniskirt -- though I certainly wouldn't be -- go for it. Can you talk about your style philosophy? If you're going to be glamorous, it has to be tempered with eccentricity so that it incorporates your own personality. Dressing up is great, but you need a twist. And one of my biggest style influences has been Rachel Zoe, who introduced me to glamour. Now I'm kind of pushing her a little bit to explore the eccentric side. Lately, I've been having a lot more fun with how I dress. I am braving the idea of ending up on a worst-dressed list, but I'm also a lot happier with what I wear. What's the most tragic thing you wore in high school? So many things! I was still recovering from Clueless when I was in high school, so probably one too many baby-doll skirts with baby Ts, knee socks, mary janes and barrettes. Maybe the occasional pair of flannel pajama pants during finals week. I don't let myself get that slobby these days. What does the word ""chic"" mean to you? I instantly think of Audrey Hepburn -- she could do no wrong. Her style was revolutionary. She was ladylike without being stuffy. And I also love Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett and Selma Blair, who is so fabulous. Any other Hollywood icons lurking in your closet? I'm currently having a Gwen Stefani moment. I just bought some beautiful shorts from her fashion line, LAMB. Do you enjoy the whole red-carpet circus? For a while it was very new and very frightening, and I would just work myself up so in all my photos I looked like I was staring down the barrel of a gun. I don't beat myself up about it anymore. Did you care when the tabloids ragged on your white Valentino dress with the black bow at the 2007 Oscars? I consider it a good sign when you end up on best- and worst-dressed lists. If you're universally best, then you've been quite boring. Let's talk about ""Get Smart"": Is it retro, or did they update the groovy sixties vibe of Agent 99's look? It's groovy in a different way. There are some things that are very mod, but we're not making Austin Powers 4 -- it's not a spoof. It's more like a comedic Bourne Identity.  Watch Hathaway, other stars talk about movie » . I wore a few body-hugging dresses, which was so fun since I'm not used to them. I did inherit 99's Chanel bag addiction, and I was very happy about that. I have a ton of action sequences, and I had to be able to fight in every single outfit. Beyond swinging a Chanel handbag, did you do anything in particular to get into shape for this role? I started working out about three months before the film began. I wanted to be curvy and muscle-y. I took my body inspiration from Jessica Biel. I didn't quite get those results, but she's great. David Kirsch, my trainer, has made sure that I am no longer self-conscious about my thighs. Eventually my knees are going to be all wrinkly and I'm not going to be able to wear things like short skirts, so I take pleasure in wearing them now. Next you play a bridezilla opposite Kate Hudson in ""Bride Wars."" Did you get to wear show-stopping bridal gowns? I really can't say too much, but there's a fantastic scene where we're both in our dresses and we do absolutely terrible things to each other. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!

1,"(InStyle.com) -- Toss that basic black and indulge in a fashion fantasy this year. We asked the four gorgeous stars of ABC's new TV show ""Cashmere Mafia"" to take part in a little experiment: If you could slip into a different guise for a day, what would it be? Frances O'Connor in Zac Posen silk gown, José and María Barrera rhodium-plated earrings with Austrian crystals. Frances O'Connor glams it up . Understated when it comes to her own style and buttoned up in banker stripes as Zoe on Cashmere Mafia, Frances O'Connor, 40, has been hankering for an infusion of pure glamour. ""I love the idea of wearing a dress that's a work of art in itself,"" says the actress, who slipped easily into a red-carpet fantasy with a mouthwatering cherry-hued gown by Zac Posen. O'Connor's ""safety first"" approach to fashion means living mostly in simple Marc Jacobs pieces, but it's a sensibility that doesn't offer much in the way of frippery -- which suits her just fine. ""I don't like to stand out too much,"" says the willowy Anglo-Aussie beauty. Still, Posen's fluttering cascades of silk offer both a role reversal and a respite. ""A fantasy has to move you to feel like a different person,"" she says. ""That's fun for a day. Then I like to put my jeans back on and go home."" Lucy Liu relives the forties . Few decades enthrall Lucy Liu like the 1940s. ""I like the idea of updating a traditional silhouette from that era in a fresh way,"" says Liu, whose character, Mia, reigns over a New York publishing fiefdom in power looks by Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino and Rachel Roy. Despite its abstract floral print, the ruffled organza dress by Christian Lacroix would seem right at home on the cover of a World War II-period glossy, yet Liu imbues it with a distinctly modern verve. ""There was something really elegant and erotic about women back then, with their girdles and cinched-in waists,"" she says. On the set the 39-year-old star relishes watching costume designer Patricia Field work her sartorial sorcery with a swirl of offbeat textures and trimmings. ""The other day my character was wearing a gold lamé striped dress with a coffee-hued belt, black leggings and green earrings. It's contagious,"" says Liu, who finds herself mixing -- and not matching -- more freely these days. Miranda Otto indulges in gems . Famous for playing a Middle Earth maiden in the Lord of the Rings movies, Aussie actress Miranda Otto found herself dressing a little like one offscreen too, in muted, ethereal garb. But her arctic complexion and fiery tresses are the perfect canvas on which to throw splashes of drama. ""Shooting Cashmere Mafia [the 40-year-old beauty plays steely hotelier Juliet] has made me lust for accessories,"" she says. Presto: Otto is resplendent in scads of jewelry. ""Wearing stacks of the stuff makes it more interesting,"" she adds. There's just one catch to donning such beguiling accents: ""My 2-year-old daughter, Darcey, wants everything."" Bonnie Somerville goes for fifties bombshell . Bonnie Somerville longs for the bygone days when women were perennially polished. ""In the fifties you'd never leave the house without your hair done, your face on, and a nice dress. Me, I have my staple uniform of jeans, tank tops and flats."" To resolve her clothing ennui, the actress chose a dazzling yellow Lela Rose number that is equal parts Bond Girl and Palm Beach socialite. ""It's something I never thought I could wear for daytime,"" says the Brooklyn, New York-bred singer and actress who plays Cashmere's trendy cosmetics exec, Caitlin. A skinny metallic belt gives the look more of a now vibe. ""On the show, with everything we wear, Patricia Field says, 'Put a belt on it!'"" says Somerville, 33. ""Now I'm buying belts in my real life, which I never did before."" E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2008 Time Inc.

2,"(InStyle.com) -- A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ingénue: ""This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,"" Heigl says. ""I like simple hair and makeup."" There has been a self-tanning mishap . As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. ""I love everything new,"" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" just started a production company at Fox. ""When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca."" She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit ""Knocked Up"" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the ""Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup"" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm ""preparing"" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, ""I'm done."" Everyone says, ""You just know when you put that dress on."" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? KH: My poor mother is probably like, ""Why, God? Why?"" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look? KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine. IS: What do you always carry in your bag? KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good. IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood. KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, ""I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl."" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, ""I just want you to be healthy."" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. For me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible. E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2007 Time Inc. All rights reserved.",0.77743423,62
4,"(InStyle.com) -- The co-star of ""27 Dresses"" discusses his personal style. ""I just feel dirty,"" says James Marsden. Not to be alarmed: There's nothing indecent going on here. James Marsden talks about his favorite kind of clothes and how his style has changed over the years. The 34-year-old is explaining what it feels like to be sporting facial hair for a film he's working on with Cameron Diaz. Yet even the newly grown whiskers can't hide the finely chiseled features of an actor who seems to have cornered the Hollywood market on hottie-who-loses-the-girl roles (""Enchanted,"" ""Superman Returns"" and, of course, ""The Notebook."") But the Oklahoma-bred star doesn't mind his wholesome image. ""That's really me,"" he says. ""I'm a little dorky -- awkward."" However, his onscreen luck could be changing with his latest film, ""27 Dresses,"" a romantic comedy co-starring Katherine Heigl. Scruffy or not, we'll be watching. You've played a prince in ""Enchanted"" and the superhero Cyclops in the ""X-Men"" movies. Is that a big deal to your kids and their friends? My daughter, Mary, is only 2, and my son, Jack, is 7. He has a Cyclops action figure, but he's really into Spider-Man and Pixar movies -- Buzz Lightyear is his guy. No ""Superman,"" no ""X-Men."" I think he just assumes that everyone at his school has a dad who's a big superhero. You also played Corny Collins, the TV dance-show host in ""Hairspray."" What were you like in high school? That's when I came out of my shell and became more social -- people thought I was funny. I got into a whole preppy thing -- Duck Head shorts and Dockers. How would you describe your style now? Functional comfort. For a guy, it shouldn't ever look like you thought about it too much, like the clothes are wearing you. Whose clothes do you like? Paul Smith off the rack -- it's a slim cut, and I don't need to have it tailored. I always feel like an 8-year-old when I dress up in a suit, like, when can I take this thing off? But I wore a black Dolce & Gabbana suit to the première of ""Hairspray"" that was like, OK, now I know what a great suit is. Classic, clean lines -- sharp, sharp, sharp. Do you change your style from coast to coast? In L.A. it's too easy to throw on a pair of American Apparel sweats, a T-shirt and running shoes and just wear those for days. In New York, I actually like looking nice. Maybe I'm just getting older, but young guys need to pull their pants up. Do you ever shop for your wife? I love shopping for dresses, and I actually do a pretty good job. When I was in New York, I went into J. Crew in Soho and got her a cool fifties type dress with tiny polka dots. Style-wise I'm good, but figuring out sizing is a different story. What do you find sexy on a woman? I like spaghetti straps for my wife -- she has great shoulders and a great neck. I love when she puts her hair up, because I can see the back of her neck, so delicate and vulnerable. It's the vampire in me. Or my obsession with cheerleaders -- their hair up in a ponytail. When I was young, I could never have that. Never got the cheerleader? Eventually -- my wife was a cheerleader. What does your wife find sexy on you? A button-front shirt with [baby] spit-up on the shoulder. That means a guy is taking care of the kids and is a good father -- that's sexy to a woman. The adult version of rose petals and champagne is if I let my wife sleep in and I get up to change the baby's diaper, feed the kids, and do the dishes. Who inspires you? Paul Newman. My middle name is Paul, and my grandfather once said I was going to look like Paul Newman. That stuck with me. Beyond being a good-looking guy, Newman is a great actor with a long career, and he's got a life. He's married with kids and lives in Connecticut, sells popcorn and marinara sauce, and gives the money to charity. Anyone else? George Clooney dresses like Gary Cooper might have. Cary Grant. ""A Streetcar Named Desire""-era Marlon Brando. They all made it look effortless. Their clothes framed their personalities really well -- comfortable, classic, but sharp. These guys could pull off a great suit, or jeans and a T-shirt. Don't you agree that guys have it easy -- they are considered ""distinguished"" as they grow older? I don't think it's guy-specific. As women get older, they become more comfortable with themselves. Susan Sarandon is the poster woman for that. A lot of guys fantasize about being with women who are in their forties or fifties. So your advice is ...? Act your age. Dress your age. Look your age. That doesn't mean you can't have fun. And isn't it time you got the girl in one of your movies? There are a couple of things I need to do [onscreen]: One, get the girl; two, pack a gun. Don't you love my career philosophy? E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!

6,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Wearing a plaid green A-line spring skirt from her new fashion line, paired with a black patent leather belt and black leather gladiator sandal stilettos, ""Sex and the City"" actress Kristin Davis is the perfect combination of sweet and fierce when we meet up after her fashion show at the Belk department store in Atlanta, Georgia. Kristin Davis surrounded by models and Belk store official Arlene Goldstein. It's a look that totally says her character, Charlotte, with a little bit of screen pal Carrie. Davis is so much like her character, adorable and upbeat, I expect Carrie or Samantha to drop in on our conversation and say something to shock her. As any true fan knows ... OK ... as every woman knows, watching ""Sex and the City"" was like being front row at a fashion show with a plot. TV show and movie costume designer Patricia Field dressed the characters in haute couture as they skipped down the streets of New York City in $600 stilettos. But is this reality? Most sane women wouldn't choose to walk even one city block in high heels. And most women certainly can't spend a month's rent on a belt or bag, even if they have a truly fabulous party to wear it to. So, what about us, the fashionistas on a budget? Are we to be ignored, forced to wear boring clothing and practical shoes? Luckily, no; designers are catching on. Target features affordable lines from high-end designers like Alexander McQueen and Isaac Mizrahi. All of the pieces in Sarah Jessica Parker's clothing line Bitten cost less than $20 before the clothing store that carried them went under. Davis is the latest celebrity to jump on the clothing label bandwagon, designing a line for Belk department stores. Will she meet the same fate as Parker? Davis has the following to be successful. Although her character was by far the most conservatively dressed (Carrie strolling through town in just a bra top, anyone?), she had the most wearable wardrobe, and Davis became a fashion icon along with the rest of the ladies. Her favorite piece from her line? ""I can't decide, impossible to choose!"" she says. So I choose for her: definitely the gladiator heels. ""It's important for women to have a strong shoe,"" she says. ""Then you can wear anything on top. With a strong shoe on, you're good to go."" She admits she didn't have a defined style before meeting Field, who bluntly told her that ""Sexy Secretary"" was going to be her look. Davis' philosophy is a good one: Stick with what works. She takes the look that Field defined for her ""Sex and the City"" character. Original it's not, but everything coming down the runway is something the stylish Charlotte York would definitely wear. Davis is in touch with all of us real women out there, saying, ""I don't want to make clothing that only skinny actresses could wear."" Her solution? Dresses, shoes and swimsuits worthy of a ""Sex and the City"" episode that you don't need Park Avenue pockets to afford. It's versatile enough to look good on every body type. ""Everyone has body issues. I really wanted to create pieces that looked good on different kinds of bodies. I had all of my family members trying on the outfits!"" she says with a laugh. Davis won't spill any secrets from the scripts of the ""Sex and the City"" movie sequel, which comes out in May 2010, but she admits it's a ""happy"" movie. She does hint that our famous foursome might have to cut back a little on their clothing expenses as art imitates life. And she's willing to share some fashion tips: How to look like you stepped out of the wardrobe room on the set of the next ""Sex and the City"" movie? Green. ""It's THE color"" she says. And hey, who doesn't need to save some green? It all works out perfectly. I left the meeting with Davis to check out her displays. Then I skipped out into the streets of Atlanta, in a pair of her new gladiator stiletto sandals. That I got on sale, of course.",0.74953747,2289
8,"(InStyle.com) -- From barefoot tomboy to fashion supernova, fearless pop renegade Rihanna lives to bust all the rules. ""I love the heavy chain over this pretty dress -- it's exactly the way I would do it,"" says Rihanna. What are some rules you'd like to crush? The idea of not wearing brown and black together seems so dated. The other day I wore a black T-shirt, black Nobody jeans, a brown leopard-print belt by Dolce & Gabbana, and brown Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and it looked awesome. Also the rule about not matching your makeup to your outfit. I do that onstage, matching red lipstick to a bright red jacket or neon-pink eye shadow to a pink jumpsuit. And I also love to mix prints. We've had the Meg, the Jennifer, and now people ask for the Rihanna at salons. Will you be switching it up again? The first time I heard people were asking for the Rihanna, it was really flattering and maybe a little strange. It caught me by surprise, but now I feel it's a very cool thing. I don't feel the pressure to change it up again at all. I like it, as they like it. Can you talk about your style obsessions and how your look has evolved over the years? It has evolved without my even noticing it. Lately I'm obsessed with Thierry Mugler... Grace Jones inspires me. She is the most iconic woman ever, in my eyes. She has extraordinary style and she's fearless. I love designer Martin Margiela; Kanye West told me about him. I also like Dsquared, Chloé, Zac Posen... But you weren't always a fashion maven? Growing up in Barbados, you were a tomboy. I wore my brother's clothes, dresses with sneakers, or no shoes at all. I would always get into trouble with my mom. She would say things to scare me like, ""You're going to get cut!"" But I couldn't help it. I would climb trees, steal mangoes, catch birds--silly things that were fun to us at the time. My cousin and I were the only girls in the group. We would have to stand up for ourselves because the guys didn't want us around. You stood out in Barbados because of your light complexion. Do you remember having trouble fitting in at school? Definitely. It made me angry... For the first six years of school, I would go home traumatized. The harassment continued to my very last day of elementary school. High school was better. I read that your mom owns a boutique and your dad works at a garment factory -- it seems you have the Rihanna fashion line already partly sewn up. [Giggles] Well I am working on that right now. It takes a lot of effort, and I want to be involved with every step of the process. What do you do for kicks in L.A.? I don't go out much. I'm moving into a new four-bedroom home in Los Feliz that I'm excited about. Parts of it will be inspired by India. I love things like canopy beds, printed fabrics and Spanish touches. Then I can stay at home and cook West Indian dishes like callaloo [stewed greens]. But I do want a sports car--as soon as I get my license. Who knew you were so domestic. Wait a minute. You're such a rebel. In the video for ""Take a Bow,"" you drive a car. I have my Barbadian license, just not my American one. How will you celebrate your 21st birthday? Don't scare me! I have till February. I feel like I have so much more to accomplish before I'm 21. No party plans yet. Many showbiz types say, ""Don't ever read your own press,"" but you do, even the online stuff. What's the kookiest thing you've read about yourself? The Grammy thing -- that I brought Jay-Z on stage and Beyoncé was upset, which is so ridiculous. Or the idea that I've had breast implants -- I don't even have much cleavage. It was just the dress! So yes, I read about myself and about everybody else in the gossip pages. It's comedy to me; I laugh about it. The tattoo behind your ear is a Pisces symbol -- two fish swimming head to tail in a circle--which represents life after death. If possible, what would you be reincarnated as? If I had to come back in another form, it would be as my dog, DJ. He gets the best treatment, all the attention in the world, and he's so adorable.

11,"(InStyle.com) -- It takes a truly adventurous actress to pull off a razored Mohawk, a platinum pixie and a Louise Brooks bob, but we'd expect nothing less from the ever provocative Selma Blair, who experimented with all three looks in under a year.

Have you always been a beauty chameleon? In high school I would mess with my hair and makeup all the time. I used to wear a shirt that said ""Ms. Clairol"" because I changed my hair color so much. I was blond for a long time, then what my mom called ""barnyard red."" Do you still dye it yourself? Only when I have to cover up stray grays. And I'll just use whatever color I find in the grocery store that looks good on the box, like Preference by L'Oréal--because I'm worth it [laughs]. But for my platinum hair, I went to Sheri at Román Salon in L.A. She was a saint. I had just dyed my hair dark brown, so she had to very slowly strip out all the color so that my hair wouldn't burn off. And the cut--are you keeping it short? I tend to like my hair whatever way it's not, so now I miss it being long. I think I'm more approachable with long hair. When it's short, I come across as being artsy and weird. What's your typical makeup look? I used to wear a lot of red lipstick, and when I got a pimple, I'd cover it up with eyeliner to turn it into a beauty mark. But everything has changed since I hit 35. I'm at an age where any makeup that's meant to look ""slept in"" really looks like I slept in it. That's for youngsters! Now less is more. I don't like to wear concealer or anything. I'd rather have uneven skin than feel like my face is cracking from too much foundation. Then you must be serious about your skin care. I go to a spa in L.A. called Kinara for its Skin Care BootCamp. You go once a week for 12 sessions and they'll look at your skin and tell you how to get it in better condition. They really helped me a lot. I also stay out of the sun. Any thoughts on Botox or plastic surgery? I wanted to get Botox once to make me feel younger. But I don't really have [enough wrinkles] to justify it yet. As for going under the knife, I can't say I wouldn't, but I haven't thought too much about it. Best beauty product? Egyptian Magic cream is my saving grace for everything. It works for my friend's baby's bottom, and I can also use it instead of Chapstick. So what's next? I'm really excited about having a perma-tan and wearing long highlighted hair extensions for my role on ""Kath and Kim."" And I've been gaining weight for the part by eating a little bit more of what I want and not moving around as much. I've already put on 15 pounds, and I'll probably gain another 10. It'll be a whole new me! Will this be your most drastic transformation? Actually I wore huge prosthetic boobs for a John Waters movie. They were glued on every day by a really handsome guy, but ripping them off every night was definitely outside my realm of comfort. After those bosoms, I didn't mind being flat-chested anymore!

13,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair. Isaac Mizrahi has earned four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. ""I always start with color when I'm designing things. Always. If the color is right, I feel better,"" he touts on his Web site. But Mizrahi has an explanation for his less than colorful attire on a recent visit to CNN Center in Atlanta. ""We have this very quick trip, and we have to go right back and there's no time to pack and we can't check luggage ... so I focused it to black, gray and white."" It's just one more style tip you can pick up from Mizrahi's new book ""How to Have Style"" (Gotham). Despite the slightly audacious title, Mizrahi, who has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has earned the right to tell women how to dress. For five years, the New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target. But with his new book comes a new job -- as the creative director of Liz Claiborne. CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: You started in acting at the High School of the Performing Arts. How do you combine that love and your love for design? Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater. I think that fashion is a form of entertainment. And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something. Like women say, ""Oh, that's a brand name I associate with because I've worn it before. I love it. It seems to fulfill who I am really easily."" Whatever it is, she knows that it just makes her life really easy so she associates with it, you know? And in the end, I am like this personality that represents that.  Watch Mizrahi talk about his new book » . But more than that, I have designs [in] the entertainment business. There's a movie called ""Unzipped"" about me that was a really successful movie. I had two TV series. I design costumes constantly for theater and ballet and opera. So to me it's all one big world. It's seamless to me. CNN: What's your daily schedule like? It has to be crazy with all that you do. Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that. There's a base to it. I wake up, I go swimming every day, and I eat the same breakfast almost every single day. But when I get to work is when it changes up. Some days I work in the showroom; some days I work in the design room; some days I actually work in my own private studio, where I just do sketches and sketches and sketches. Other days I work in the TV studio taping segments and my Web show. I don't really love travel. I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean? When I finally let myself enjoy it, I can enjoy traveling. But it takes a great agony for me to separate from New York City and my studios and the people that I work with. CNN: Say you're walking down the street. What's the most common style error that you see in people? Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair. I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair. You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair. Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day. But I always think that women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair. It's like you should spend your most money ... on your hair. You'd think I had a chain of hair salons, but I don't. [Laughter]. CNN: What about in home furnishing? You do a line for Target that's ending this year. What's the most common mistake people make there? Mizrahi: You know what it is with people? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home -- they leave things around. I like to think about cabinets. I like to put things away as much as possible. It's like salt shakers on the table? No. You put the salt shakers in a cabinet, and the table looks so much better when it's plain. You know what I mean? And people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that. I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers. You either have gorgeous, gorgeous flowers, or you have no flowers. Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table. That's awful, but it's true. CNN: How has your personal style evolved over time? Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style. I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork. And every once in a while I break out and do something crazy. CNN: Can you describe your personality for me, and how it affects your style? Mizrahi: I don't know. It's very hard to describe one's personality. I can't say about my personality, but I like to think that I'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design. It's kind of like here's the 360 degrees of what's going on [in] the world culturally, you know? Socioeconomically, culturally, and here's my response to it. Here's what the clothes look like; here's what you should be wearing. And it's kind of like a wonderful edge, you're standing, and yet there's room enough in there for your own interpretation or to move in one direction or another. Oh! Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic. I am very claustrophobic. I don't like to commit to one thing necessarily, but when I do commit to it, it's whole and complete.",0.73354733,9728
14,"(InStyle.com) -- Ever wonder how actresses like Sienna Miller look stunning 24/7? Good genes, sure. But they also get a little help from their friends . Sienna Miller and favorite hairstylist Adir Abergel: ""If I worried what people thought about my look, I'd get it all wrong."" Sienna Miller and hairstylist Adir Abergel . Try to talk coifs with Sienna Miller and she'll cut you off at the pass. ""I don't even own a hairbrush!"" she insists. ""I'm really not too attached to my hair."" No kidding. She gamely lopped off about 10 inches to play Edie Sedgwick in Factory Girl. But the actress is much less keen to part with her hairstylist Adir Abergel, for whom she has been known to cook dinner at her London home. ""Adir gets me,"" says Miller. ""He knows I never like to look too done or polished."" Her biggest challenge? ""I've got quite a lot of hair, but I like it flat, so Adir squashes it down for me."" To create Miller's ideal look, Abergel flatirons her roots and combats bulkiness with Frédéric Fekkai Coiff Finishing cream. ""Sienna feels most like herself when her hair is soft and airy versus set and stylized,"" he says. Still, it takes effort to appear this artfully undone. It may seem like she rolls out of bed looking glamorous, but Miller says it is not that easy: ""I'm very much involved in how I want to look."" Eve and makeup artist JJ Jacobucci . She dyed her hair platinum as a Philadelphia teenager, rose to fame as a hip-hop biker chick, and cavorted with a tiger -- and later Gwen Stefani -- on MTV. It seems like Eve was born edgy. But until recently the rapper-singer-actress clung religiously to her signature look of cat eyes, dewy skin and pale pink lips, aided by the habitual application of MAC Lipglass in Malibu Barbie (she's also a company spokeswoman). It was on the L.A. set of Eve's candy-colored video for ""Tambourine"" (the hit single off her fall album Here I Am) that makeup artist JJ Jacobucci motivated the star to test a new image. ""JJ recently said to me, 'Thank you for letting me experiment,'"" says Eve, referring to a Cyndi Lauper--inspired look that involved electric-blue eye shadow. ""I have definitely opened up a lot more."" Says Jacobucci: ""We were so used to seeing her in nude lips, bronze skin and comfortable colors. I push Eve to get out of that box."" The star has lately sported hot-pink lips, chartreuse highlighter on her browbones, and blue mascara with newfound confidence. ""At first Eve was like, 'Oh my god,'"" says Jacobucci of such intense shades. ""I was like, 'Listen, trust me. I'm going to make you look gorgeous.'"" Kate Bosworth and hairstylist Renato Campora . During the last three years, hairstylist Renato Campora has seen all shades of actress Kate Bosworth. ""When I met her, she had beachy [sandy] highlights,"" says Campora, who brightened up Bosworth's Blue Crush--era color so she looked ""more movie star, like a young Marlene Dietrich."" Campora's platinum touch sent his number straight to Bosworth's speed dial. ""It's a little secret,"" she says of his closet coloring abilities (he's known primarily as a haircutter). ""I call him months in advance!"" Naturally, she also uses him as her stylist -- it was Campora who gave her the sleek bob that solidified her status as a hair icon last year. ""She was the first one to have it,"" he says. ""And then everybody did the bob. She was the inspiration."" For someone whose biggest struggle is building volume (Bosworth has ""baby angel hair,"" says Campora) the bob was perfect; her hair looked thicker, and it practically styled itself. ""I could jump out of the shower, give it a tousle and leave,"" says Bosworth. Her next experiment? ""I want to be a redhead -- a deep, Karen Elson redhead. Just to go there once."" Hilary Duff and makeup artist Rachel Goodwin . When Hilary Duff first settled into Rachel Goodwin's makeup chair in 2004, she felt like she had found a soul mate. ""It was really instant,"" says Duff, who fell head over heels for the Chanel artist's ability to create high cheekbones, luxe lashes and pale lips. But never mind the makeovers for movie premières and music videos for her latest album, Dignity; for Goodwin, the real test was meeting Duff's family. ""My mom [Susan] did makeup for Neiman Marcus, so she knows what looks good and what doesn't,"" says Duff. Luckily, Goodwin wowed the 'rents. ""That's when I knew it was OK -- when Susan was like, 'This is good work,'"" laughs Goodwin, who now pushes the boundaries with blue shadows and white eyeliner. ""I have really big eyes,"" says Duff, ""and for the longest time I would use black eyeliner to make them look smaller. Rachel actually made them look bigger by lining them with white. I love how she makes me see myself differently."" Now when the two get together, they share more than makeup tricks. ""We see each other a couple of times a week for hours,"" says Duff. ""We talk about boys, life and work. We know each other so well. It's like a big therapy session every time."" Rachel Weisz and hairstylist Mark Townsend . She may be an Oscar winner, but Rachel Weisz has little in common with her gilded statuette. ""In real life I'm very unpolished,"" says the mother of 17-month-old Henry. ""Dressing for the red carpet is fantasy time, but in my day-to-day life, I'm very grungy."" This low-maintenance attitude has served her hair well. ""It's in great shape,"" says Matrix hairstylist Mark Townsend. ""Rachel's hair matches her personality: It's not overdone, not super-fussed-over. And she's incredibly approachable and sweet."" Fearless too: In 2005 the British actress sheared her locks to a half inch to play a dying woman in The Fountain. While growing out her hair, she often donned extensions. But a year later, when Townsend suggested she wear a thicket of curly, waist-length tresses to the Oscars, the eight-months-pregnant star didn't feel so brave. ""Are you sure we need this much hair?"" Weisz asked. But Townsend soldiered on, confident in his vision. ""I wanted fullness in the back to balance out her silhouette,"" he says of the baby bump/hair bump symmetry. The romantic updo proved lucky -- and prophetic. ""Now I'm growing my hair out,"" she says. ""I've come to like it really long and unruly."" E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2009 Time Inc.

""It all goes back to wanting to be an individual. I have my days of not feeling super-great, but that's universal. My style has evolved as I've become more aware of myself as well as what looks good on me -- and what doesn't."" 2. Find labels that work for you . ""It's always nice to have a running tally of designers that fit your body well and that you feel comfortable in for any number of events. It makes you feel less limited."" 3. Identify shapes that flatter . ""I'm not super-picky about color. I'm more picky about the cut of a garment. I look terrible in anything bias-cut for instance, and I prefer Empire waists.""  Mandy explains other fashion choices » . 4. Dresses are secret weapons . ""I love dresses! If it's flowy and loose, you don't have to worry about what shape you're in, frankly. Plus there's something romantic and ethereal about vintage dresses that I adore."" 5. When in doubt, bring a belt . ""I'm looking at my dress today, and I wish I had brought a belt with me because it looks like a gigantic tent. Having a belt to define your waist is always better than hiding behind something."" 6. What really makes you look good . ""If you're confident and you feel good, people pick up on that. And it doesn't really matter what's happening from the neck down. I'd rather be comfortable than anything else."" InStyle.com: Witness Mandy's amazing style transformation . 7. Some trends won't flatter you -- avoid them. ""I tried footless leggings and then I realized, this is not a trend for me. When something stops at your midcalf, it can be somewhat shortening. But I feel like long tights make any look ladylike and classy."" 8. Find a great tailor . ""I've been having trouble finding jeans lately. So I've been buying vintage high-waist trouser jeans and having them tailored. My tailor understands my body. She's always encouraging me to wear stuff tighter."" 9. Hoop earrings work on everyone . ""My friend Raina's always telling me to wear hoops. She's like, 'Even if you're in jeans, a T-shirt and flats, hoops are sexy, cool, and everyone looks good in them.' "" 10. Give yourself a break .

16,"(InStyle.com) -- Style-maker, TV host and opinionated fashionista Carson Kressley explains how to give yourself a complete makeover--inside and out. Style-maker Carson Kressley spills the naked truth on giving yourself a mental makeover. Minimize the negative . As Coco Chanel said, ""Fashion is architecture: It's a matter of proportions."" In other words: No matter which part of your body you dislike, there's a clever way to divert the eye elsewhere. Try different styles and employ horizontal (widening), vertical (elongating) and diagonal (slimming) lines as necessary. Venture out of your comfort zone . ""Many women get used to dressing their body a certain way because they think it's the only thing that works for them,"" says Kressley. Find a boutique or department store with well-trained salespeople and try on three styles you've never worn. It might be a fabric such as jersey that you've always deemed too clingy or an Empire-waist camisole that you're convinced looks too young. Not every experiment will be a success, but even one new style or color will prove that there are more ways than you thought to look your best. Don't be ruled by your insecurities . If you've been avoiding the beach or missing out on parties because you're afraid of being the largest person there, grab a friend and go to the very place that incites terror--just be sure you're wearing an amazing outfit. Avoid a blackout . ""Have you ever seen a happy goth?"" muses Kressley. ""I think everyone needs color to feel good."" Too many women rely on head-to-toe black as a form of camouflage. But any hue can be slimming if worn monochromatically--so instead of black, reach for plum, gray or chocolate brown. Clean out your closet . Whether you're holding on to clothes that are too small because you hope you'll fit into them someday, or clothes that are too big for fear you'll grow back into them, you're keeping past wounds open. ""Old clothes stop you from living in the present,"" says Kressley. ""They reinforce what you used to look like."" Get rid of anything you haven't worn in two years and replace it with something new that makes you feel pretty. And while you're out shopping, have a house-cleaner swing by for good measure. Write yourself a love note . Some women are so obsessed with their hips that they fail to notice their flat tummy. Remind yourself of your virtues by writing a note that says something like ""Hey, you have a great chest!"" Tack it to the bathroom mirror so you'll see it in the morning and before bedtime. ""We're so trained to look for the negative that we need a physical reminder of the positive,"" explains Kressley. Have a princess moment . Treating yourself to a massage, a body exfoliation, a professional blow-out, a brow shaping or a mani-pedi can elevate your mood by affirming to yourself that you're worth the splurge. Get naked . Some women on Kressley's show are so self-conscious about their bodies that they're reluctant to be naked around their husbands. That discomfort affects how they feel when dressed too. Before you can move as if you own the room, you'll have to be at ease inside your skin, and spending time in the buff can help. One idea: Take a bath with the (gasp!) lights on--no candles. ""Feeling comfortable with your body alone is the first step to feeling comfortable with your body around others,"" says Kressley. If all else fails, fake it . One of Kressley's favorite mantras is ""looking cute is feeling cute."" So if you're having a low day, force yourself to go through the motions. Put on your makeup, do your hair, wear a great outfit. Sometimes faking it can give you enough of a boost to lift you out of the doldrums. ""Feeling pretty,"" Kressley says, ""changes your whole outlook because you feel good about yourself.""

17,"(CNN) -- As recognizable as the brand itself, Donatella Versace is adamant about one thing in fashion: ""Fashion is not frivolous,"" she told CNN. Glamour, femininity and sensuality: The three watchwords of Donatella Versace's fashion empire. It may not be frivolous, but in many respects it is a form of fantasy, something that Versace has developed as head of the Italian fashion house since taking over the reigns after the tragic death of her brother Gianni. ""We sell a lifestyle, so to own one piece of Versace is like to own a whole outfit of expensive things. That's why we do many different things,"" she told CNN. With a range of lifestyle items from sunglasses to furniture and even hotels, the Versace brand developed since the 1980's when it was all about supermodels and a confident, almost decadent, glamour. Not that the rich and beautiful have disappeared from the world of Versace. Fans and faces of Versace read as catalogue of glossy party A-listers included Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Halle Berry, Kate Moss and Demi Moore. Gianni Versace was one of the first fashion designers to recognize the power of celebrity, and Donatella, working with her brother, had a strong hand in the advertising campaigns. With iconic photographer Richard Avedon taking the shots, his images and Donatella's direction helped create the bold image of Versace in the 1980s and early 1990's making it synonymous with toned and beautiful Hollywood stars. It was Gianni who designed ""that dress"" that launched Elizabeth Hurley's career and Donatella's own safety pin moment came when Jennifer Lopez had the paparazzi and fashionistas goggling when she wore a plunging green Versace at the Grammys in 2000. While she has taken the Versace company in her own direction, Gianni was a huge influence on her life, encouraging her to join him when he was setting up his burgeoning fashion business. ""Gianni was a very strong personality. We were two people who loved each other dearly. We were brother and sister. Very tight family. When Gianni became a big fashion star I was the only one who told him the truth,"" she said. After he was shot dead outside his Miami home in 1997, Donatella had to cope with running the fashion empire and deal with her own grief. ""I didn't know if I would follow exactly Gianni's steps or find my own way and I was suffering from my brother's death. But in the meantime I had to be strong because everybody around me was looking at me for direction. But then I found my way and I started to believe in myself more and more, find my confidence and here I am,"" she told CNN. The Versace image may be more toned down compared to 20 years ago, but for Donatella the three guiding words of Versace remain: ""glamour, femininity and sensuality."" ""I think fashion is to make people dream. Nobody thinks they are going to look exactly like the model on the runway, nobody wants people to think that, but it is here to make people to want to have something. I try the best I can to try and make people to want and desire things,"" she said. China is one part of the world that Donatella is increasingly selling the dream, with the first Versace show in Beijing in early November signifying a new chapter in the Versace brand expansion. ""Chinese people view fashion in a different way from other people. They buy the whole style, the whole look together. In other countries they like the accessory or they like the clothes but they like one thing of the look. [In China] it's good because you can convey they message together,"" she told CNN. Donatella's fashion tips: . CNN: What should a woman always have in her wardrobe? Versace: A pair of black high heels. CNN: What should a man always have in his wardrobe? Versace: A pair of low-waist pants. It makes your upper body taller and your shoulders larger. CNN: What is the most commonly made fashion mistake? Versace: Too much make-up and clothes together. It's about one of those, not all. CNN: What is the ugliest trend you've ever seen? Versace: Flat shoes and lunch pants together.",0.7004155,1289
18,"(InStyle.com) -- As an aspiring ballerina, 9-year-old Brooke Burns took an aggressive approach to makeup. ""I would borrow my mom's red Borghese lipstick and smear it on like a clown!"" she says. ""For sexy eyes, there is nothing better than this drugstore black liner."" Nowadays, the 29-year-old Burns, a single mom, tries to pass along subtler application tips to her 7-year-old daughter. ""I taught her 'a dab'll do ya,' ""says the actress, who stars in the ABC comedy ""Miss Guided."" ""She's going to wear it anyway, so she might as well have some experience."" Did you pick up any makeup tricks working as a model? One of my favorites is putting white pencil on the inside of the bottom eyelid for that very awake look. At night if I'm in a hurry, I'll just put on a lot of mascara and black pencil all the way around the inner rim. It's a totally sexy eye in a minute and a half. What's the one makeup item you can't live without? I'm in love with Revlon Color Stay foundation. I can do anything in that makeup and it stays. Plus, it has sunscreen in it and gives me a really natural glow. It covers everything. You alternate between being a blonde and a brunette. Which do you prefer? My natural color is dark blond, but right now I like being a brunette. I did a movie last summer and they dyed my hair platinum -- I hated it. I have a big personality, and I think big personality plus blond hair makes me come across as glib. With dark hair, people look at your face more. Before, it was all about the hair. How do you keep color-treated hair healthy? I've never found a conditioner that makes my hair feel as amazing as Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing shampoo by L'Oréal. My hairdresser used it on me one time, and now I'm obsessed. I also use a new color from Paul Mitchell -- it's called Fudge Brownie -- that's incredible. So many people comment, ""Your hair looks so healthy!"" Have you always had great hair? No. I totally had big hair in high school. I was a big user of the hot rollers and teasing. And I had mall bangs. I also wore my hair in a bun a lot because of all the dancing I did. I wasn't really popular in high school. No one will believe you if you say you weren't popular. ""Olive Oyl"" was my nickname. I was totally gangly and a foot taller than all the boys. It was not attractive. Clearly you've come a long way. What's your secret? I think it's very important to take care of your skin. Obviously the No. 1 thing is sunscreen. All my life I have used Oil of Olay as my daytime moisturizer because my mom did. I also use their foaming face wash. It's the best makeup remover ever. And in the morning I use Olay Age Defying Daily Renewal cleanser because it has these tiny microbeads that are great for exfoliating. People go, ""You have such great skin!"" and I'm, like, ""Thank God I'm not spending $150 on products."" I'm sure that stuff is great, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. E-mail to a friend .

19,"(CNN)  -- Mirror, mirror on the wall -- tell me my body faults, one and all. That's what a lot of women ask their mirrors to tell them, at least until they get a boyfriend or a husband they can torture with the dreaded question, ""Does this dress (or blouse, pair of pants, skirt, etc.) make me look fat?"" But even when women get the answer to that no-win question, what can they do? How do you disguise those thunder-thighs or flappy arms or muffin-top middles? You might want to choose between high-fat and no-fat clothes. That's right -- no-fat clothes. They're the outfits that can take 10 pounds off your problem area, according to Charla Krupp, who wrote ""How to Never Look Fat Again."" Her mantra is: ""It's not you, it's your clothes."" ""All women know the language of food,"" says Krupp, so she describes how to look your best in food terms. But not the old-fashioned terms of body shapes being either apple or pear, because women's ""body issues can range from a wide face all the way down to cankles."" It's not just a matter of vanity; the author cites research finding that fat can keep people from getting hired. The ingredients to her ""never looking fat system"" are: fabric, fit, styles and colors. High-fat clothes come in shiny metallic or sequin outfits in bright or neon colors that either fit too loose or too tight. Low-fat clothes come in darker hues of silk or cotton or wool gabardine and fit perfectly. ""I didn't want to sugar-coat anything,"" says Krupp. She doesn't. She gives information not even your most blunt best friend would tell you about what will make you look your best or your worst. There also is a Don't You Dare section in every chapter. Krupp goes so far as to tell how the part in your hair or your eyewear choice can help you see a beautiful woman or Humpty-Dumpty in the mirror. But there is hope. She says even women size 16 or 18 can look their best if they make the right choices. Those begin with what's under the outfits. ""You need good supportive shapewear. It will slim you down,"" she says, adding a good one will have a high waist, right under the bra band, and will go down to whatever your problem area is. To smooth out the dreaded back fat that can ruin your appearance, she suggests wearing a control camisole over your bra to ""compress and flatten"" the roll that could follow you everywhere. She also advises to not fall head over heels in love with a trend that is bad for you. ""I do see a lot of women walking around and I wonder, how did she go out of the house in the morning looking at that?"" says Krupp. ""They fall in love with a fashion trend even if it doesn't work for them. ... 'I know this is going to make me look fat, but I don't care.' "" Krupp says the wrong trend can be brutal for a woman. ""Transparency is big now, but if you have fat, you don't want the world to see that -- you want to cover it up."" She says the celebrities that always look good in their clothes are Sandra Bullock and Demi Moore. But she notes that even if you're rich and famous and in great shape, you don't always make the best choices, even if you have a paid stylist to help. She noted two such fashion mistakes from the recent Academy Awards. Jennifer Lopez's gown with a big bustle and train was a bad, or ""high-fat,"" choice for a woman with a wide backside. And she said Charlize Theron's Dior Haute Couture dress of amethyst and lilac with rosettes on her bust was just a ""really bad choice."" ""They really should sue their stylists for malpractice,"" says Krupp. Or they could trade the stylist for Krupp's book.

20,"(OPRAH.com) -- It's probably good that I'm not rich. Money, it seems to me, sends people in one of three directions: . Lisa Kogan cites the increase in intelligent, witty, creative women as a reason she can be cheerful. It accelerates an innate inclination to be generous, or it accelerates a kamikaze inclination to party with the Olsen twins, or it sucks away your sense of purpose and produces a desperate need to eat nothing but those little white cheddar Cheez-It crackers while staring blankly at an endless cycle of ""Will & Grace"" reruns. I like to think that if I were rich, I'd be the kind of person who looks at the world and decides to fund cancer research and build schools and feed the hungry, and save whoever needs saving, but there's an excellent chance I'd be the kind of person who looks at the world and decides never to get out of bed again. In fact, despite my very real (and utterly inconvenient) need to earn a living, I'm still the kind of person who leans toward the whole Cheez-It thing. To begin with, I have a slight tendency toward depression (think Sylvia Plath listening to a freshly downloaded acoustic set from Leonard Cohen). And when this particular brain chemistry is confronted with the incredibly unsettling knowledge that people no longer work like dogs to get ahead, they work like dogs just to stay where they are, well, a girl starts needing a few good reasons to get up, put on a little lipstick, and venture out. But it's no secret that it's not pretty out there. Food prices are soaring, the housing market is plummeting, the middle class is disappearing, the climate is changing, and Madonna is touring. This is all the more reason to keep a soothing thought or two close at hand. Someday soon, I promise, we can sit down together and come up with a breathtaking bucket list that finally commits us to skydiving with Morgan Freeman just as we've secretly prayed we would, but today I'm offering a different kind of list. Oprah.com: How you (yes, you!) should live your life . Good reasons to put on a little lipstick and venture out (or at least put on clean pajamas and raise your window shade a couple of inches): . • Junior high is just one long daisy chain of nonstop mean, and you have officially survived it. That's right, my friend, you may have to face locusts, drought, and World War III, but you can now go forth secure in the understanding that seventh grade is over. You get to wake up each and every morning without worrying that Arleen Posner got the same Frye boots as you. You will never have to read ""Beowulf,"" be groped by a 13-year-old reeking of his father's Aqua Velva, or feather your bangs again. The enormity of this revelation must not be underestimated. • Javier Bardem walks among us. • My delightfully decadent friend Stephen Whitlock recently discovered a recipe for bacon ice cream (DavidLebovitz.com), and get this -- the first step involves candying the bacon! Let's all take a moment of hushed reverence to contemplate this. Oprah.com: Five friends every woman should have . First came the polio vaccine, then Neil Armstrong made a giant leap for mankind, and today we actually have the technology to combine pork fat with butter fat, salty with sweet, crunchy with creamy. I firmly believe that what chicken soup does for the common cold, bacon ice cream will one day do for the premenstrual woman. • One word: Spanx. We can now have our scoop of bacon ice cream and wear a clingy Diane Von Furstenberg jersey wrap dress too. • Intelligent, witty, creative women appear to be on the rise. I like men. I like men so much that I even had a baby with one of 'em, but the baby is now 5, and it's nice to be able to show her some brilliantly talented females -- Rachel Maddow (MSNBC host), Mindy Kaling (playwright, producer, actress, ""The Office""), Janice Lee (her debut novel, ""The Piano Teacher"", hits stores in January, and it's an absolute knockout) -- who are very good at what they do. As role models go, Dora the Explorer only takes a mom so far. Besides, check out Dora's expressionless little brow -- I'm pretty sure it's coursing with Botox. • Ordinarily, I would not include houseguests on my list of bright spots, but Mabel, the dog I am currently babysitting, is causing me to rethink my position. Mabel suffers from a chronic greeting disorder that manifests itself as follows: I leave the room for 10, maybe 12 seconds. Upon reentry, Mabel welcomes me with a level of enthusiasm usually reserved for soldiers returning from three years in a POW camp -- a one-dog mariachi band of pure, unmitigated joy. Unless my boyfriend and our daughter sense that I'm carrying a pizza, my return from nine or 10 hours at the office rarely merits more than a mumbled ""They never came to fix the dishwasher."" There's something to be said for a bit of good old-fashioned, uncomplicated affection, even when it comes from a shedding, slightly incontinent 14-year-old beagle. • Tony Soprano is either dead or eating onion rings, but Don Draper is alive and mesmerizing every week on ""Mad Men."" • You know those little stain remover pens that everybody keeps in their bags and desk drawers? I couldn't care less about them. Life is inherently messy, and I accept the odd spot of cranberry juice as part of God's great plan for me and the vast majority of my T-shirts. But the other night at our local diner when Julia accidentally catapulted her chocolate milk shake across our booth, there was my pal Valerie, dry cleaner's pen, ice water, and paper napkins at the ready. Val is just one of those intuitive, insightful, ironic, wildly generous, deeply adorable women who, despite working two jobs, is quietly, unequivocally there for the people she loves. If you need a complex carbohydrate, she's got the whole grain pasta salad. If you need a sock puppet, she's got the glue gun. If you need a boost, she's got the ceramic vase brimming with sunflowers. The woman once went on vacation, and I was absolutely bereft. Two weeks without Valerie Soll feels like a house without books. You see, Javier Bardem, bacon ice cream, and all the mad men in the world don't change the hard truth that plans frequently fail and dreams have been known to dim. But come the morning, there are your friends offering sweet salvation and good gossip and the occasional glass of Sauvignon Blanc with lunch.

22,"(CNN) -- The AMC series ""Mad Men"" has been honored for its sharp writing, polished acting and engaging portrayal of life at a New York advertising agency in the early 1960s. ""Mad Men"" has gotten attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. It has also been much noticed for something else: its fashion sense. The series, which features all the looks of that era -- thin-lapeled suits and skinny ties, crinoline-puffed dresses and pencil skirts, Peter Pan collars and subdued pinks and greens -- has attracted attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. Banana Republic, which has placed ""Mad Men""-inspired clothes in its window displays, is even offering a walk-on role for the winner of a contest. ""Mad Men,"" which returns for its third season Sunday, isn't the first Hollywood creation to influence fashion trends. For decades, movies and television shows have played a primary role in dictating people's fashion choices, whether they've been aware of it or not. Here are a few examples. 1. In the 1934 film ""It Happened One Night,"" star Clark Gable took off his shirt and showed his bare chest, instead of the standard white undershirt. For decades, an urban legend has maintained that undershirt sales dropped up to 75 percent, not to recover until World War II. Though the mythbusting site Snopes.com says the truth is uncertain, it's testimony to the legend's strength that we're still talking about it 75 years later. 2. The 1967 film ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" with its (somewhat idealized) Depression-era fashion, continues to inspire today's designers. Faye Dunaway's berets, scarves, trench coats, fitted cardigans and long pencil skirts were a hit at the time and remain so today. 3. ""Annie Hall"" boldly showed women that the masculine preppy look was attractive. Star Diane Keaton wore baggy pants, dress shirts, a vest and tie in the 1977 Woody Allen film. The film is said to have influenced a spike in tie sales for women. 4. ""Saturday Night Fever"" rejuvenated a fading disco craze in 1977 and told men it's OK to wear crotch-hugging pants, wide-open, chest-baring shirts and large medallion jewelry. John Travolta's white polyester suit -- later bought by film critic Gene Siskel at auction -- became a disco-era icon. 5. The 1983 film ""Flashdance"" made active wear -- like a ripped sweatshirt off one shoulder, tight leggings and leg warmers -- sexy for women in the early 1980s. Actor Jennifer Beals is said to have cut the collar off a sweatshirt that had shrunk in order to get it over her head, according to the Internet Movie Database. 6. The 1980s TV series ""Miami Vice,"" with its lightweight fabrics and pastel colors, proved a hit on television and in menswear departments. Star Don Johnson's signature look -- T-shirt, suit jacket, linen pants and shoes worn sockless -- could be seen all over the country. (He also popularized the unshaven, stubble-bearded look.) 7. ""Sex and the City"" trendsetter Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, talked about her shoe addiction constantly during the HBO series, which ran from 1998 to 2004 and spawned a 2008 movie. Soon, stilettos -- paired with a thrown-together look -- became something the cool crowd of viewers would follow, along with brands such as Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo. 8. A game show starting a fashion trend? It happened with ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" which featured host Regis Philbin sporting a monochromatic shirt-and-tie look. Later, he launched a line of shirts and ties in the Regis by Van Heusen collection.",0.65104955,6671
23,"(InStyle) -- Drew Barrymore keeps evolving -- from star to producer, and now director. Drew Barrymore sat down with InStyle for its October issue, on newsstands Thursday. The 34-year-old actress earned critic's attention with her uncanny portrayal of ""Little Edie"" Beale in HBO's ""Grey Gardens,"" and her directorial debut, ""Whip It,"" has been hailed as a success well before it rolls into theaters October 2. But, at her core, she's still the irresistible free spirit we all know and love, as she revealed in the October issue of InStyle. On being a celebrity ... Barrymore said that while she loves her life, there are still moments she battles with being a celebrity. ""Some days I want nothing more than a brilliant mask so I could look like someone else and go wander the streets and be free,"" she said. ""I'm very peeved that Halloween only comes once a year."" On exercise... When it comes to transforming her body for a role, as she did for ""Grey Gardens,"" the sunny actress is nothing but dedicated. But in everyday life, Barrymore aims for balance and body acceptance. ""I don't have the time or discipline or interest in having a perfect-10 body. I work out, I eat right, but I'll always be a little bit of Jell-O on a pole."" On her relationship with her mom ... Barrymore admitted her relationship with her mom is a topic she doesn't readily discuss, but the central love story between a girl and her mom in ""Whip It"" caused Barrymore to reflect on her relationship.""I am OK with my dad, but my mom and I have yet to work it all out,"" she said, adding that she doesn't talk about it because ""how do you talk about something you're confused about?"" On girl power ... From ""Charlie's Angels"" to her new all-girl roller derby flick, it's no secret that Barrymore champions female friendships. ""I like teams -- I like buddies. I don't understand women who are competitive, apart from positive forums like athletics. One person is a powerful thing, but a tribe is unstoppable."" On her first fashion faux pas ... Barrymore is known for her ever-evolving, ever-eccentric style, but said anything she donned during the ""E.T."" era can be labeled as a fashion faux pas. Or can it?  ""Velour and taffeta, together? Oh, no, no, no. Now I think it's brilliant."" On her first broken heart... Barrymore recently broke up with The Strokes' drummer Fabrizio Moretti, and called the five-year relationship one of the most important in her life. But when it comes to her first broke heart, Barrymore said it was her ""first big boyfriend, Jamie Walters.""

24,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- ""My One and Only"" begins with Renee Zellweger, playing a woman based on George Hamilton's mother Anne, discovering her husband with another woman. Renee Zellweger plays a woman based on George Hamilton's mother in ""My One and Only."" Despite the initial heartbreak, Anne puts on a happy face, and Zellweger gives life to a character who's determined to make the rest of her years comfortable and adventurous. Her husband's indiscretion is the catalyst that sends Anne on a cross-country quest to find a new husband in 1953 America. She pulls her two sons out of school in New York City and the trio set off on an adventure by car. The tale has its roots in actor George Hamilton's young life. The film takes a look at gender roles of the time and how women were perceived. Much of the film gets colored in by the characters and their ever-present emotions (though Zellweger's fabulous frocks add plenty of color on their own). Zellweger, who won an Oscar for ""Cold Mountain,"" spoke with CNN about ""My One And Only,"" George Hamilton and the way she believes she is perceived.  Watch Zellweger talk about playing Hamilton's mother » . CNN: What do you think of George Hamilton as a person now, knowing what he went through in his youth? Renee Zellweger: I think it's so fascinating. It was probably my favorite part of this experience, discovering that this was actually his life story. I mean, who knew? You have an idea about who a person is based on their public persona and the work that they've done. He's a spectacular actor, and his collection of parts that he's played and work that he's done is unbelievable. ... But to get to know him, he's so interesting. He's so clever, and he's very kind. Very kind. CNN: You're playing Hamilton's mother. Did he fill you in on what she was like? Zellweger: No. You know, that's what's so interesting about it. [Despite] being such a personal ... project that he worked on so closely with Merv Griffin for over a decade ... he didn't. He had great faith and he just kind of let us go, which was sort of unbelievable when you look back on it. It was really clear to me from what was on the page who she was. CNN: Did you like her? Zellweger: Very much. She's kind of doing the best she can, and she thought, oh everything's kind of a lark ... and things work out without your having to put your hands on it and make it happen. But she learns a different way and a more satisfying way to be involved in her own life, which is wonderful. So she sort of discovered that she could and gave herself permission to be in charge of herself. It was kind of a wonderful journey to watch. CNN: She was judged on her looks many times in the film. Have you faced similar situations, being judged on your looks and people not taking you seriously? Zellweger: Not in such an overt way. I'm not an actress who made her way based on physicality -- I think quite the opposite, in fact. I sort of disappear a little bit, with respect to my looks. I'm lucky. I'm not a standout, kind of knockout kind of girl that, you know, it's all about my great hair or something. But, in subtle ways, maybe. I mean, people presume to know you for something and respond to you accordingly, I'm sure. CNN: How was it stepping into the era of old Hollywood? Did you enjoy wearing the clothes from the early '50s? Zellweger: I loved it. I loved it. I had such a great time with it, and I brought a lot of my own things, actually. Things that have been given to me, things that I just would find while I'm traveling on the road but have no opportunity to wear. You know, junk store finds that I think are spectacular. We brought them in, spruced them up and made them costumes. It was really exciting; it was fun. CNN: Do you think you would have liked to work in that era? Zellweger: Oh, yes and no. Yes because the glamour of it all or the -- it feels like play to me. It's like playing dress-up all the time. And no because of the responsibility of having to maintain that immaculate presentation all the time would be exhausting. I think back on Marilyn Monroe putting those lashes on everyday, and I can't imagine, as I tie up my sneakers to go for a run. I cannot imagine that you're supposed to simultaneously look beautiful while you're going out to buy groceries. I just don't know that it would fit well with my personality. I don't know that I would succeed (laughs).",0.64370954,6938
25,"(InStyle) -- While the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been celebrating film's best and brightest for more than 80 years, the glamour we associate with the Oscars truly started in the 1950s, when stars such as Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Janet Leigh brought high style to the ceremony. Anne Hathaway accessorized her Armani Prive gown with more than $1 million worth of Cartier jewelry. Since then, the red carpet has been a can't-miss staple of the evening, and Hollywood's hottest stars work with fashion designers, wardrobe stylists, jewelers, hairstylists and makeup artists to create looks they hope will go down in fashion history. This year's show was no exception, and high-wattage stars such as Anne Hathaway, Kate Winslet and Natalie Portman walked the red carpet in stunning couture gowns. Here are just a few of our favorites: . • Best actress nominee Anne Hathaway made the most of her big night, arriving in a champagne-colored strapless Armani Prive gown that glittered with paillettes and Swarovski crystals. When the ""Rachel Getting Married"" star turned to give an over-the-shoulder pose, she revealed an unexpected onyx and black crystal dragon brooch, which was affixed to the back of her gown. Diamonds are always in fashion on the red carpet, and the actress accessorized with more than $1 million worth from jeweler Cartier. • Best actress nominee Kate Winslet looked as stunning as ever in an asymmetrical Atelier Yves Saint Laurent gown and Chopard jewels. Despite her picture-perfect appearance, the Oscar winner for ""The Reader"" admitted, ""I'm extremely nervous!""

The 24-year-old, who said an enthusiastic hello to her parents in India from the red carpet, wore Martin Katz jewelry, including a ring set with a 150-year-old diamond from her native country. • In a sea of red and white dresses Natalie Portman stood out in an orchid gown by Rodarte, vegan heels by Stella McCartney and a vintage Rialto clutch. The actress' minimal Kwiat jewelry and elegant updo highlighted her flawless skin. Portman was truly an Oscars triple threat, making our best dressed, best hair and best makeup lists. Other colorful bests included Sarah Jessica Parker's Dior Haute Couture gown, which we loved not only for the shade (which she described as ""barely mint, maybe seafoam"") but also for its impressive size. Best supporting actress nominee Amy Adams was stunning in a crimson silk and satin gown by Carolina Herrera and a jaw-dropping, jeweled collar necklace by Fred Leighton (as seen on Beyoncé in the November 2008 issue of InStyle!). And Heidi Klum's bright red dress was not only glamorous, but also charitable: For the second year running, the ""Project Runway"" host partnered with The Heart Truth campaign to raise awareness of women's heart health by wearing red. Last year, Klum wore a custom red dress by John Galliano for Dior that was auctioned off for charity, and this year she hit the carpet in a red silk taffeta gown from RM by Roland Mouret. The stylish supermodel accessorized with a diamond and ruby bracelet charm of her own design that will be part of a giveaway on dietcoke.com.

""I don't look back... Life is not something made by order, we have to fit in the pattern of what life is all about now, and I'm a person who fits easily into this kind of situation because I like change,"" he told CNN in Shanghai. While his own image is enduring, he is the creative force of  the Chanel fashion house, whose eponymous designer, Coco Chanel created some of the most iconic outfits of the 20th century. He may have upset the traditionalists when he first took over the reins, but for the forward-thinking Lagerfeld, it was not a concern. ""My job is to put in people's brain the idea what Chanel was all about, even if it was not about such a large choice of things... I pushed [Coco Chanel's] symbol, like the change of pearls, in a way much more than she did herself. I could play with everything and mix it with everything that's going on in fashion because fashion is about that. It's not retrospective, it has to be something you want to wear now,"" he said. As for the notoriously harsh world of fashion, Lagerfeld sees it merely as a reflection of the way the world works. ""This is a world with no pity or that you can complain, 'I couldn't do it because things are against me.' No, things are against nobody, if you have something to offer, or if you can be something,"" he said. ""If you want to be successful in the fashion world, as well as the movie world and music world, it's something else that you need, but you cannot decide that you have it. It's up to you to sew it, but it's up to the others to use it. In a way it's the worst of worlds, but if you made in the world, it's beyond pleasant."" Confident and unabashed Lagerfeld is looking forward to more creative inspiration and hard work. His contracts with Chanel and Fendi are for life. ""Chanel died doing her last collection in her 90s, so I have time. I don't think like this. It's my projection, always six months, six months, six months. I don't know. People laugh at me to disappear but I'm not ready for that one. ""I am born for the battlefield. Competition is healthy you know.

President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrive in  Prague, Czech Republic, in early April. No sooner does her inaugural ballgown get spirited away to the Smithsonian, then out it comes: The First Lady Suit -- that tailored, multibuttoned blazer over a skirt straighter than an Ionic column in a primary, patriotic or tastefully unobjectionable color.

Because during these first 100 days, our newest first lady has banished every version of this silhouette as if they were all designed by the House of Dick Cheney. Instead, Mrs. Obama has defined with remarkable acuity what flatters a tall, broad-shouldered and curvaceous working woman who knows exactly who she is and where she is going. With an enviable eye for color and layering, she has fashioned a riveting parade of on- and off-the-shoulder dresses, cardigans, cinched trenches, leggings, wide-legged trousers and full skirts, working them in intense florals or unexpected hues such as chartreuse and emerald.

28,"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The backstage gossip at recent fashion shows wouldn't be complete without rampant speculation about who is likely to replace esteemed American Vogue Editor in Chief Anna Wintour. Vogue editors Anna Wintour and Carine Roitfeld at AmfAR's 10th Annual New York Gala in January 2008. Wintour has yet to announce any plans to retire but her advancing age -- she's 60 this year -- has stoked speculation that after more than 20 years in the role it might be time to leave. One name touted as a possible replacement is Carine Roitfeld, the highly respected editor in chief of Vogue Paris. Read more about Carine Roitfeld . Roitfeld is accustomed to the speculation, describing it as ""frustrating."" She told CNN she hadn't been offered the job and even if she was she probably wouldn't take it. ""It's a bit like for an actor. Do you want to go to Hollywood or do you want to stay here in Paris and do the cinema I like to do?,"" Roitfeld said. ""I think I prefer to stay here in Paris.""

Roitfeld is anxious not to create any friction between her and her U.S. counterpart, telling CNN ""I think Anna does a great job... I think she's a great person.""

They are a select group of incredibly stylish and wealthy women who are thrilled rather than alienated by unconventional ideas.

Its circulation of some 139,000 is dwarfed by the million plus readers of American Vogue. Fashion shoots are about fantasy. There's no imperative to make any clothes they feature wearable. If it's unusual and innovative, then it's in. With just 25 staff, Roitfeld describes the team at French Vogue as like a family. And that's how she prefers it. Having said that, she told CNN she wouldn't dismiss any offer out of hand. ""Of course I would consider it because it would be ridiculous not to consider such a huge position -- in terms of money and in terms of power,"" she said. ""But I'm very happy.

29,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- With strong sales and equally powerful praise, the July issue of Italian Vogue can be judged a resounding success. Chanel Iman is one of several models of color featured in the ""Black Issue"" of Italian Vogue. Dubbed the ""Black Issue,"" the magazine celebrates models of color from the past and present, including Donyale Luna, Liya Kebede, Naomi Campbell, Iman and Chanel Iman. Within 72 hours, the magazine sold out in the United States and Great Britain. Blog posts and e-mails about the beauty and historical significance of the issue began to flow -- and industry insiders were equally pleased. Praising renowned photographer Steven Meisel, who shot most of the issue's fashion pictures, The New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn gushed, ""I think they are some of the best he's done. ... They are crazily, softly beautiful, plainly the work of someone who knows women and fashion.""  See what all the fuss is about » . Another 40,000 copies of the ""Black Issue"" were recently reprinted to meet the still strong demand. But will the all the hoopla translate into tangible change for black models in the fashion industry? Will more color be seen on the runway and in magazines? Many observers have their fingers crossed. ""All the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that it's OK to use more black girls,"" said Carlos Ojeda, an agent at New York Models. ""It's OK to have more than just one, and she doesn't have to always be Naomi."" ""Italian Vogue is very influential around the world on an artistic level,"" said Constance White, style director at eBay. ""That is the book that all the art directors, the photographers, any fashion editor looking for inspiration turns to ... and always has. It has always been the trendsetter, so hopefully people will look at it and say using black models is both relevant and right and will start doing it too."" Bethann Hardison, a legendary model agent-manager, said she has noticed a shift in the industry since she began holding town hall meetings last September to address the lack of diversity in fashion. The packed-to-the-rafters events quickly became the talk of the industry, and Hardison is widely credited with sparking the current movement. ""I started seeing more black models on the runway back in February,"" she said, pointing to the shows of designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Michael Kors as examples. ""I have already seen change, and I know that I will continue to see change."" Not all are nearly as optimistic, and fear the diversity issue will become as passe as the skinny-model debate of a few years ago. ""I hate to sound cynical, but by January, I feel like it will be back to business as usual,"" Ojeda said. ""I want to be hopeful and positive, but a part of me does not want to get my hopes up."" ""Let's see if Italian Vogue is going to be able to live up to the standards that they've now set,"" added one prominent New York-based stylist. ""You can't have an issue with all black girls, pat yourself on the back and say 'that's it for the year.' "" Hardison is working hard to make sure that doesn't happen. She's already scheduled another town hall meeting for September, and she's also planning a mixer to introduce fledgling models of color to industry players. ""We just have to keep the bar high,"" Hardison said, ""and keep showing beautiful women and pictures."" Lola Ogunnaike is the entertainment correspondent for CNN's American Morning.",0.6152187,7652
30,"(CNN) -- When Katy Milane was asked to be in her college roommate's August 2007 wedding, she expected the bridesmaid dress to be simple and sporty, just like the bride's taste in clothes. Katy Milane, right, said none of the bridesmaids in her friend's 2007 wedding liked this hot pink dress. It wasn't. Milane and five other bridesmaids wore hot-pink floor-length satin dresses. One wedding guest commented that they looked ""like a row of Pepto Bismol bottles."" ""I don't think any of us were happy with the dresses,"" said Milane. One bridesmaid had to be sewn into her gown when it ripped the day of the wedding. Another left her dress in a Cincinnati, Ohio, hotel room after the festivities had ended. ""We all tried to be very positive about it because the bride really loved them,"" said Milane. ""We would have worn anything to make her happy."" Such is the case at countless weddings. Bridesmaids are stuck in matching dresses that they will likely never wear again. Some say that brides choose less-than-attractive dresses for her attendants to keep everyone's attention on her. Whatever the case, there are plenty of women with bridesmaid-dress horror stories.  Check out some ugly bridesmaid dresses and pretty alternatives » . Kimberlee Norbury of Orland, California, was aghast at the bridesmaid dress her cousin chose for her saloon-themed wedding in July 2006. Norbury and three other bridesmaids were asked to wear ""saloon girl"" dresses purchased at a nearby costume shop. The dresses, complete with lace garters and corset tops, were so short that some of the bridesmaids added fabric to make them longer. Even with the additional fabric, Norbury walked down the aisle with her bouquet strategically placed in front of her. ""Everyone knew what I was doing,"" she said. ""I can laugh now, but I was so horrified."" As soon as the wedding ended, Norbury changed out of the dress. ""I was running for my clothes as fast as I could."" ""Afterwards I did explain that I loved her very much,"" she said. ""That's the only reason I wore that."" Freedom of choice . Chandi Brooks knows how expensive bridesmaid dresses can be. She's been in five weddings -- as a bridesmaid three times and the maid of honor twice -- and has never worn any of the dresses again. According to Conde Nast Bridal Media's American Wedding Study, the average price of a bridesmaid dress in 2005 was $138.20. ""It's money down the drain most of the time,"" Brooks said. That's why she decided to let her bridal party choose their own dresses for her June 2007 wedding. Brooks' attendants picked black dresses that ranged from $20 to $100. The bridesmaids, all different sizes and ages, were pleased and so was the bride. ""I didn't have to shop around and didn't have to hear any griping. Everyone was happy,"" said Brooks. Other brides also are giving their attendants the freedom of choice. Celia Stangerone of Windsor, Connecticut, asked her bridesmaids to pick tea-length lavender dresses. The length and color were the only restrictions she placed -- the shade of lavender, style of dress and type of shoe were up to each individual bridesmaid. Stangarone said she's close to her bridesmaids, which factored into her decision to let them choose their own dresses. ""I knew the type of personalities I was dealing with and I also knew that they were all different sizes and shapes,"" she said. ""I had to let them pick whatever style they felt beautiful in."" The final result was perfect, Stangarone said. Her bridesmaids chose dresses in varying shades of lavender that complimented each attendant's body type and skin tone. ""They all looked beautiful and were all really happy,"" she said.  iReport.com: See the bridesmaids' lavender dresses . Keeping bridesmaids happy . Many of those who lived through their own bridesmaid nightmares hope not to put their friends through the same pain. Milane, who remains friends with the bride, is not planning to have a wedding anytime soon. When she does she intends to choose a dress that her bridesmaids can wear again.

31,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Any woman who's ever watched ""Sex and the City"" has at some point tried to guess which of the characters she's most like. The overly confident Samantha? The slightly prudish Charlotte? The pessimistic Miranda? The overanalytical Carrie? Candace Bushnell attends a fashion show during the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in September. But an honest viewer probably would have to admit that she's similar to all of the characters in some way. As a writer, that is Candace Bushnell's gift. In her books, including ""Sex and the City,"" ""4 Blondes"" and ""Lipstick Jungle,"" Bushnell has given the pop culture world feminine role models with which it can identify. And the best-selling author's newest book, ""One Fifth Avenue,"" provides a few more -- including attorney Annalisa Rice, gossip columnist Enid Merle and gold digger Lola Fabrikant. Although all of her characters are fictional, Bushnell said each one is based on a common type of person. ""I've always been interested in people. It's part of being a novelist, really, part of the job,"" she said. ""As a writer you can never know a real person as well as you know your characters.""  Watch Bushnell talk about her new book » . Bushnell said a minor character or two often will appear in several of her books. Other characters she develops in her head for years before releasing them on the literary scene. For instance, she kept one fictional character, Schiffer Diamond, under wraps for 20 years, never seeing a place where she fit in -- until ""One Fifth Avenue."" The story of a vicious scramble for a penthouse apartment once owned by a high-society queen shows the life of New York City women through the lens of where they live. One Fifth Avenue -- an actual building near Washington Square Park -- is an address that each character thinks will be her ticket to fortune. Bushnell contrasts old and new money -- and old and new media -- in the course of her tale. A New York lover herself, Bushnell looks like she belongs on a fashion walkway. Arriving at CNN in a blue dress, bright green jacket and what look like 6-inch heels, it's obvious the author isn't just a bystander of the fashion capital. But those expecting a who's who of the designer world should take another look at Bushnell's subject matter. ""My books are social satire. They have a sense of the absurd,"" Bushnell said. ""They have to say something about contemporary life."" ""One Fifth Avenue"" touches on art and antiquities theft, crosses back into the world of blogging and zips over to the stock market in less than 400 pages. Though the book is just out in stores, it was written months ago. So how did the author -- who's been celebrated in the past for her ahead-of-the-curve approach to trends -- know the economy would be such a central focus of her readers' current lives?

And with a thriving career, two children, and a handsome boyfriend -- Jake Gyllenhaal -- who can blame her? On her divorce from Ryan Phillippe ... You have to keep it together for your kids and for yourself too. I'm trying to learn from the things that have happened in my life, live more in the moment, and have more fun. Someone told me recently to live in the present but make plans and take pictures. And I am. I'm writing more, I'm reading more. Going to more concerts. Jake and I went to Coachella this year. On being confident ... As you get older, you know what you like and what you don't like, and you're not apologetic about it... I used to judge myself so harshly. I think women in their 20s do. You're hard on your body, you're hard on yourself. But you start to realize that none of it is really all that important. As long as you're comfortable, the best parts of yourself come through no matter what. Your mother can tell you that a million times, but you don't understand it until you live it! On if she likes to cook ... I do. And Jake is a great cook, he does a lot. We spend the weekends outside L.A, in Ojai, where I have a farmhouse. We have chickens and we grow cucumbers and tomatoes. I love it. It reminds me of where I grew up in Tennessee. On working out ... I try to exercise every day. I like to run for about an hour, and I'm big into working out with girlfriends. It's an acquired skill, being able to discuss your love life, children and friends, all while you're running! But we have mastered it. On her new perfume ... I have a lot of favorite smells from growing up in the South that I wanted to capture in this scent. As a kid, I was always outside. There was a magnolia tree in the front yard that I think I spent most of first, second and third grade in. And there was the smell of honeysuckle from the creek that ran down by our house. Gardenias were important too, because every Mother's Day or on my birthday my father would buy small bouquets or corsages for my mother and me. While we were working on the perfume, Avon asked me if I could explore other notes, but I kept going back to white flowers! The packaging reminds me of my grandma's bureau, where she'd have little perfume bottles out. I love it. On her girlfriends ... There are three of us who wear pretty much the same size, so we'll get together on a Friday night and I'll bring clothes I want to trade and they'll bring theirs. We swap shoes and purses a lot. I wore my girlfriend's dress to a wedding recently. It's fun. On raising her kids, Ava and Deacon, far from home ... Sometimes it's really difficult for me, being far away from home. L.A. is where my job is and I have to be close, but I never imagined that my children wouldn't grow up next door to my brother's children. Or my mom and dad wouldn't constantly be around. You know, I had dinner every night with my grandparents as a kid, so I think missing out on that is a hard compromise. At least I have a lot of Southern friends in L.A. I gravitate toward them. I think of those people as a part of my family: They take care of me and I take care of them. On being a mom and a career woman ... I love my life without work and I love my life with work. My mom, who's a nurse, called me the other day when I was really stressed out from working a 15-hour day. And she was like, ""Yeah, but think of it as a part-time job."" And I thought, that's actually right, it puts it in perspective. I work incredibly hard for three months, but then I get a break. It's about really enjoying my time off. Where do I relax the most? Where are my children happiest? My ideal scenario is to do one movie a year. But as an actor, I don't think you can do an awful lot of planning.

37,"(RealSimple.com) -- Why shoes are called ""pumps"" and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love. So, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start? Manolo who? Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show ""Sex and the City,"" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed ""crackowes"" or ""poulaines"" -- after Kraków, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Who invented the sports bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born. The coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere. Almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually. Real Simple: Best bras for every figure . Is there a real Mary Jane behind Mary Jane shoes? Not quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in ""Buster Brown,"" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s. Mary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. What's the connection between Shakespeare and raincoats? Gabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench. Who was the first person known to have pierced ears? No one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C. Sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops. And guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy: Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C. Real Simple: Best way to clean jewelry . What was the inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's colorful printed dresses? Bored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the ""Lilly"" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born. The style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice. How did pumps, stilettos, and sneakers get their names? The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore ""sneaky."" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953. The word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors. When did folks start toting around umbrellas? For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. And another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes. Have bikinis always been so popular? Hardly! Named for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song ""Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini."" Were French cuffs really created for the battlefield? It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to only as ""double cuffs."" Have women always carried purses? Once upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts. Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. The solution? They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. Why is underwear nicknamed ""drawers""? In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants. Made of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century). Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.

HLN's Nancy Grace makes her fiction debut with ""The Eleventh Victim."" A little something. What was it? Something...some detail was wrong.  . He couldn't just leave the body lying there like that. There was something missing. It was biting at him. He'd tried to go, walking back to his car in the dark twice now, but the nagging in his brain wouldn't let him leave until she was absolutely perfect. He looked at her lying there in the moonlight. Her dead body was absolutely stunning. Before, when she had been alive, sitting in the passenger seat of his car, talking and talking about her life and herself and her journey from Anniston, Alabama, to Atlanta to break into acting, he thought his head would blow up like a bomb. She just wouldn't shut up. What did she think it was...a date? She was a hooker. He spotted her climbing the steep steps out of the MARTA subway station downtown. She got straight into his car with a big smile when he offered her a ride. Once inside, driving, he kept looking away from the road, stealing glances at her neck. Something about it drew him. Maybe the shape, the curve -- or maybe it was the soft hollow spot at the bottom. It was the only thing about her he could stomach. Watch Nancy talk about her new novel » . He lowered the automatic windows so her conversation would fly out into the night and he wouldn't have to hear it. Her teeth and lips revolted him. The shiny pink lip gloss she was wearing had thickened in spots across her lips and some had smeared onto her front teeth. Looking over at her as she talked, Cruise thought it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Back to the task at hand. What was it? It was maddening...he couldn't bring himself to leave until everything was just right...perfect, in fact. Every detail mattered. Like a delicate soufflé or performing his specialty, decorating with boiling-hot spun sugar, perfection was achieved only by acute attention to detail. There, in the dark of the clearing, it hit him. Turning, he walked to his car and reached through the open window into the glove compartment and got it. The baker's twine. It was his favorite brand --it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from France. He had posed her on her back. The four bright-red puncture marks torn into her mid-back didn't bother him at all. In fact, the dark red against the white skin created a vivid contrast that was somehow pleasing to him. Walking back to her body, which he had spread carefully on a bed of soft grass to more suitably frame her pale limbs in a night lit only by the moon, he paused again. He needed the perfect spot. He couldn't rush this or he wouldn't sleep all night. The wrist? Like a bracelet? No. She was wearing a tacky, gold-tone watch. That would ruin the whole thing for him. And he couldn't bring himself to actually touch the timepiece she wore there on her right wrist. It looked cheap; he was sure the gold-tone finish was turning dark at the edges of the band. The neck? No. It was much too close to the lip gloss. The gloss had a faint, fruity odor, foul as gasoline fumes to Cruise, and that alone made him want to retch. It would totally destroy the twine's effect. Sometime during their ""date,"" fresh, damp dirt and a little grass had smeared horizontally across her mouth and worked its way up into her nose. He left it there. That was a beautiful and poetic touch of nature, but the lip gloss...disgusting. As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night. And as he relived that moment, it came to him in an epiphany. He decided...the left ring finger. Perfect. He squatted down and gently picked up her left hand. The wrist was still limp. He tied a single, perfect bow around her ring finger just before rigor set in...before the body went stiff and cold and hard. He placed the hand back gently across her stomach. Backing away a few feet to take in the whole picture, finally, he could relax. Every detail was exquisite. Finally, he could get some sleep. The bow was perfectly symmetrical, and there, in the moonlight, it was just gorgeous. Almost like a wedding band. From THE ELEVENTH VICTIM by Nancy Grace. Copyright © 2009 Toto Holdings, LLC.

39,"(CNN) -- When Clifton Green and his wife adopted an adorable little girl from Ethiopia, they knew they would eventually have to deal with the hair issue. Clifton Green learned how to care for his daughter Miriam's hair, which is very different from his own. The Atlanta, Georgia-based couple, who are white, had read books about transracial adoptions that addressed how to deal with Miriam's springy curls that grew in full, dark and strong after a toddlerhood of baldness. Green took it upon himself to learn how to care for and style his daughter's textured tresses. ""We didn't have any skills, but we had the desire,"" said Green of learning to do his now 5-year-old daughter's hair. ""It's the culture, it's important and we want to honor it and respect it."" For many African-Americans, having a child walk around with unkempt hair is an almost unpardonable sin. That desire to be well groomed extends into adulthood and the multitudes of hairstyles are as diverse as the black community itself. There are naturals, weaves, chemically relaxed styles, braids and dreadlocks, to name just a few. Far from being superficial, black hair and its care goes well beyond the multibillion-dollar industry it has become and is deeply rooted in African-American identity and culture. ""Barbershops and beauty salons are perhaps second only to black churches as institutions in the community,"" said Ingrid Banks, an associate professor of Black Studies at University of California, Santa Barbara and author of a forthcoming book on contemporary black beauty salon culture.  iReporters share their hair-stories » . ""It's not about hair per se, it's about what hair means, particularly for black women in terms of racial identity, identity based on gender and ideas about power,"" she said. ""On one level, hair matters because race matters in our society. For black people, our hair has been infused with these racial politics."" Banks points to the ideas, which continue to linger, that if a black woman straightens her hair she is ""selling out the race"" and/or ""embracing the white standard of beauty"" while women who wear their hair in natural styles are ""blacker than thou."" ""When we think about that, there is no other racial or ethnic group in which those ideas come to bear on someone's politics,"" said Banks, who gathered data for her book by traveling to black hair salons across the country. ""No one is saying that about white women, Asian women or Latino women."" Erin Aubry Kaplan, who wrote an article about Michelle Obama's hair and its implications for Salon.com, believes the first lady's straightened and perfectly coiffed style helps her image. ""She has been criticized about many things, but I think that underneath the criticism about her being radical or too outspoken about race is this uneasiness people have about her being this tall, dark-skinned woman,"" Kaplan said. ""So her hair is important, because if she is tall, dark-skinned and has an Afro then she becomes really scary."" Sound off: Is there such a thing as 'good hair?' That unease was also evident in 2008 when The New Yorker magazine ran a cover with a drawing portraying Michelle Obama wearing an Angela Davis-style Afro while fist bumping her turban wearing husband. ""[The cover] I think was meant to poke fun at what people really fear,"" said Kaplan, who added that as a black woman who does not have kinky hair, she has had her own share of issues. ""I understood the intent, but we aren't at the point where we can laugh at black images, because every black image resonates and reflects on black people as a whole."" Robert Morris can relate to the perceptions that black hair can evoke. The CNN iReporter recently cut the dreadlocks he had been growing for years and said that along with the physical makeover came an attitude shift in how people responded to him. Check out Morris' iReport on his change . ""I wasn't as approachable when I had the locks,"" said Morris, who now sports a shorter, cropped do that he is enjoying. ""It seemed like I had the stigma of being 'the angry black man.' "" People's possible reactions to hair caused another iReporter to lose sleep. Tamille Johnson said her decision to get kinky twists kept her up the night before her visit to the salon. Read Johnson's concerns in her iReport . ""It was really surprising to me because I was so afraid what people would think about them and I didn't think I would feel that way,"" Johnson said. ""Whenever I would get my hair done, I would get straight styles and I did not know if people would think that the kinky style was pretty."" Johnson, an administrator at UC Berkeley, said she found the experience to be soul searching and she came to terms with the fact that as long as she thought her hair was beautiful, that was all that mattered. That attitude is one Renae Valdez-Simeon hopes to impart to her two daughters. Because her children are biracial, Valdez-Simeon said she has often heard comments about her children's ""good hair."" Go to Valdez-Simeon's iReport . ""When a child has straight hair, they are told they have 'good hair' and while people aren't telling children with curly hair that they have 'bad hair,' in essence that is what you are saying because you are saying that straight hair is good hair,"" Valdez-Simeon said. Valdez-Simeon, whose site Mixtkids.com is billed as ""One Mom's journey to raise empowered mixed-race children,"" said she has increasingly heard the comments because her 7-year-old sports tight, curly ringlets while her 1-year-old's hair has yet to curl.   ""I try to explain to people that good hair is not straight hair, it's healthy hair,"" said Valdez-Simeon, who also said all of the comments have come from African-Americans. Comedian Chris Rock saw the same attitudes in his young daughters and it helped motivate his new documentary ""Good Hair."" The film is narrated by Rock and explores black hair from a variety of angles, including the booming $9 billion generated by the black hair industry and the science behind chemical relaxers used to straighten hair. Rock also visited the Bronner Bros. International Hair Show in Atlanta, a twice-a-year event that has been in existence since the company started in 1947. Janet Wallace, hair show manager, said as many as 50,000 attendees have come annually to each of the events to see the latest trends, services and products available. Stylists and the public alike are enthralled by the art form that is hairstyling, Wallace said. ""People want to look good from the cradle to the grave,"" Wallace said. ""Hair is fun because there are so many adornments and things you can do with it."" Green acknowledges that he has not reached that level of artistry yet, but takes pride in styling his daughter's hair well. On weekends, the Emory University professor can be found wielding the various combs, brushes and products he has found that work for Miriam's hair (Carol's Daughter is a favorite at the moment). While he said he's still not that good with ""rows,"" the cornrow style that braids the hair close to the scalp, he can work other braided styles, twists and an occasional French braid. The ritual of doing Miriam's hair is not only a time of bonding for the pair, but also an opportunity for him to honor his daughter and her heritage. Green has kept his sense of humor about the many people who express surprise that he is so well educated about and skilled with black hair. ""I don't want people to look at her and tell she has white parents,"" he said, laughing.",0.53558165,6102
40,"(InStyle.com) -- We asked five stars for their innermost thoughts on perfume, then chose the season's best new scents . Beyonce: ""I'll stick with one scent for five or six years. I'll wear it all the time."" Beyoncé . What was your first perfume? 273 by Fred Hayman. I wore it when I was a teenager. My mom used to wear it, and I stole it. (Fred Hayman 273, $55/2.5 fl. oz.; fragrancenet.com) What images would pop into your head if you smelled it now? Getting ready, curling my hair, putting my makeup on, going out to a party. And my mother, my childhood, my house. What does your house smell like? Vanilla. Warm and sweet. I have a lot of Diptyque candles around the house. Even when I'm away, I have someone burn them. I like having the scent in my pillows. (Diptyque Opopanax candle, $55; bergdorfgoodman.com) You're the face of Emporio Armani Diamonds, which has rose and raspberry notes. What's it like? Soft, sweet and comforting. Yesterday I had a day off, which is rare, and I took a long bath. When I got out, I was by myself and knew I would be all day, but I still sprayed it on. (Emporio Armani Diamonds, $50/1.7 fl. oz.; at Macy's) What other scents do you like? My favorite scent is my mother's cooking: her yams and her soul food. They smell like love, like being full and happy. How about men's cologne? I like [anything by] Creed. (Creed Original Santal, $110/1 fl. oz.; neimanmarcus.com) Emmy Rossum . What fragrance did your mom wear while you were growing up? Lancôme Trésor. It still reminds me of watching her get ready to go out at night. (Lancôme Trésor, $81/3.4 fl. oz.; lancome-usa.com) What was your first perfume? I got Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds for my sixth birthday. I felt so sophisticated! I'd put my mom's red lipstick on my lips and cheeks, wear her high heels and spray the fragrance all over myself and the house. (Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds, $65/3.3 fl. oz.; perfumania.com) Which kind of fragrances are you usually drawn to? I like ones that are clean, feminine, and not so famous that they are immediately recognizable. I [rarely] tell anyone what scent I wear -- it's a woman's most precious sensual secret. Can you let us in on some of your all-time favorites? My favorite is Miss Dior Chérie. It's classic and feminine, but flirty. I wear it to lunch, to dinner parties, to the beach, skiing and to big occasions like the Oscars, when I want to feel especially glamorous. (Miss Dior Chérie, $65/1.7 fl. oz.; at Nordstrom) What men's scent do you like? Angel Men. It's masculine and very appealing without being too strong. (Thierry Mugler Angel Men, $102/3.4 fl. oz.; bloomingdales.com) Which kind of smells are you attracted to for soaps, shampoos, lotions and home fragrances? I like traditional Johnson's No More Tears baby shampoo and Kérastase products. I like vanilla and pomegranate for soaps. My favorite candle is Jo Malone Wild Fig & Cassis. Do you wear perfume when you're acting? Always, especially during intimate kissing scenes! I wear something that is sensual but not too obvious. Sarah Jessica Parker . How is your new fragrance, Covet, different from Lovely, the first one you helped create? Lovely is very polite. It's the girl you marry, and Covet is the girl you date, you know? Covet is fun, slightly wanton, desperate. It's for a stop-at-nothing-to-get-what-you-want kind of a girl. (Sarah Jessica Parker Covet, $52/1.7 fl. oz.; macys.com) What was the first scent you wore? Love's Baby Soft. (Love's Baby Soft body spray, $12/1.5 fl. oz.; at drugstores) If you got a whiff of it right now, what memories would it trigger? It would be seventh grade and not having enough disposable money. It would be Fiorucci, a shirt tied in a knot at the waist, and the Yankees. It would be fighting with my brothers and sisters before school and my mother yelling at me, and not finishing my homework on a Sunday night. Do you wear fragrance every day? Without question. For some women, it's lip gloss or mascara or covering a blemish. I can do without all of that. But the idea of not putting on perfume is shocking to me. Where do you apply it? I love walking into a closet and smelling lingering aroma, so I always spray my clothes. And at the end of the bottle, when the atomizer no longer reaches the tiny little dribble that is left, I unscrew the top and pour the remainder onto a T-shirt or my dress. What's your favorite men's scent? I really love Old Spice and Guerlain Vetiver for men. (Guerlain Vetiver, $74/4.2 fl. oz.; saks.com) What home fragrance do you love? There's nothing better than a blue Rigaud candle. (Rigaud Chèvrefeuille candle, $75; gracioushome.com) Do you have a favorite flower or fruit scent? I love a peony when it's really in season, and I love lemons. Gwyneth Paltrow . Do you wear perfume every day? Not if I'm just in sweatpants around the house. But if I go out, I always squirt something on. It completes the look. Are you always attracted to the same kind of scents? It depends on my mood. [Sometimes] I like things that are a little more spicy. I really like Black Orchid, Tom Ford's perfume. Something a bit sexy. Tom Ford Black Orchid, $65/1.7 fl. oz.; neimanmarcus.com. You're the face of Estée Lauder Pleasures. How would you describe that fragrance? It's floral and feminine, a sitting-in-your-garden kind of scent. (Estée Lauder Pleasures, $45/1.7 fl. oz.; at Macy's) What perfume did your mom wear when you were a kid? She wore Quadrille by Balenciaga, and they don't make it anymore. I always go online trying to find bottles [stashed] in someone's basement to give to her as a present because she's almost out of it. Has your taste in scents changed since you became a mom? No, but when I was pregnant I couldn't tolerate the smell of anything, whether it was garlic, orange juice or perfume. Now do you avoid scents that might overwhelm little noses? I just don't overdo it. A little spritz goes a long way. What are some other, non-perfume fragrances you love? I love the smell of lilies and paperwhites. I also burn these tea-scented candles from Mariage Frères. The best shampoo I've ever found is Japanese -- it's called Molto Bene B: Oce. It's so good for dry hair like mine. (Mariage Frères Thé Rouge candle, $65; aedes.com; Molto Bene B: Oce Shampoo SE, $16/8.1 oz.) What scent do you love on men? Ocean water. I like natural scents. Victoria Beckham . How would you describe Intimately Beckham? It's a white-flower fragrance with a lot of tuberose, which is my favorite flower. It's fresh and sexy in a fashion-y way. I think it's a happy smell. (Intimately Beckham, $42/1.7 fl. oz.; ulta.com) Does it remind you of anything? White flowers remind me of my grandmother: timeless and gorgeous. Everything I wear I would like to think of as timeless as well. I still wear dresses I bought 10 years ago. So you like florals? I love rose, tuberose and orange blossom. I'm a real girlie girl -- I love perfume, makeup and hair products. I think I know how girls want to smell. Do you wear different scents for different moods? For me it's more about the weather and what you're wearing and who you're with. Intimately Beckham is light, and perfect for warm weather. That's why we came up with Intimately Beckham Night (coming next year), which is slightly heavier. How involved was David in creating the fragrance? He was hands-on. He's masculine, but he's in touch with his feminine side too. He loves clothes and beauty products and aftershave. Which men's scents does he like? David and I both love Miller Harris. (Miller Harris Feuilles de Tabac, $120/3.4 fl. oz.; bigelowchemist.com) What was your first fragrance? Coco Chanel. If I smelled it today, it would take me back to being 14, just when I was first really getting into fashion. (Chanel Coco, $110/3.4 fl. oz.; at Nordstrom) What scent did your mom wear? Poison by Christian Dior. It was so distinctive. It instantly reminds me of the eighties -- all that hair and those big dresses. (Dior Poison, $43/1 fl. oz.; drugstore.com) Any other favorites? I love Jo Malone's grapefruit smells. And I have to say, nothing looks better in the bathroom than a bottle of Chanel No. 5 -- that's the ultimate. E-mail to a friend .

42,"(InStyle.com) -- The holiday season is also the engagement season! A gorgeous cushion-cut stunner by Daniel K. Yes, you read that right. It's been said that nearly 40 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine's Day. If you're one of the lucky ladies hoping for a ring this season (or one of the nervous gentlemen contemplating popping the question), use this guide to popular diamond shapes and cuts -- and the stars who sport them -- to get acquainted with the dazzling world of engagement rings. Emerald . No shape more aptly fits the diamond nickname ""ice"" than the emerald, a rectangular cut with lean facets extending down the sides. This elegant art deco shape received its confusing name during the 1920s, when it was typically used for emeralds. Characterized by a flat top and step-shaped side facets, an emerald cut cries out for a clean setting. Star Power: Eva Longoria, Ellen Pompeo, Melania Knauss . Asscher . The Asschers of Amsterdam, gem cutters for the British royal family, designed this striking, dramatic shape in 1902. A square with diagonally cropped corners and stepped sides, it features a high crown and sheds a gentle light. Star Power: Tameka Foster, Ashlee Simpson, Christine Costner . Cushion . A square with curved sides and rounded corners, this stone shines softly instead of sparkling. Cushion-cut center stones surrounded by tiny diamonds are especially in vogue. Star Power: Jeri Ryan, Courtney Ford, Guiliana DePandi . Princess . Think of this flirty, flashy option as the ""Yeah, baby!"" stone, and not only because it was dreamt up in London during the swinging sixties. The arrangement of the gem's many (49 to 144) facets produces a hall-of-mirrors effect. Star Power: Stephanie March, Kara Janx, Sarah Michelle Gellar . Oval . Ovals have been enjoying a high profile since Tom Cruise placed a gorgeous one on Katie Holmes's finger. The cool cousin of the round, the oval shares many of that stone's features, with plenty of sparkle and versatility when it comes to settings. The long shape is especially flattering. Star Power: Bridgette Wilson, Toni Braxton, Rebecca Romijn . Pear . Made to sit with the point facing up, this lusciously feminine (and unusual) cut frequently goes solo because few wedding bands fit easily beneath the large underside of this stone. Star Power: Katherine Heigl, Lela Rochon, Tiffany Fallon . Marquise . The name for this cut comes from 18th-century Versailles, where courtiers wore ship-shaped rings as a sign of their rank. Today the marquise can be worn lengthwise or sailing sideways across the finger. Star Power: Catherine Zeta Jones, Victoria Beckham, Portia de Rossi . Round . Created by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919, the round diamond is the most popular shape for engagement rings. It's often called the round brilliant because it has triangular facets, arranged to direct light from the bottom of the stone up through the top for maximum sparkle. Star Power: Katherine McPhee, Roselyn Sanchez, Mary J. Blige . Radiant . This rectangular stone, introduced in the seventies, lives up to its name: By combining long, lean, step-cut and triangular facets, it refracts lots of light. So if you decide on this shape, keep the setting simple. Star Power: Heidi Klum, Leslie Grossman, Anna Chlumsky . Rose-Cut . Most diamonds have a flat top with facets on the edges and bottom, but a rose-cut diamond is domed and covered with facets. Carat for carat, rose-cut diamonds, which cast a mellow, soft light, are typically less expensive than other shapes. Star Power: Melissa Akey . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!

43,"(CNN) -- Grace, Kara and Trichelle were created to fill a void for young black girls who for so long have been playing with dolls that don't look like them. Stacy McBride-Irby, creator of the new Barbie, poses with the dolls. The new black Barbies released by Mattel have fuller lips, curlier hair and other features that the company says more accurately represent African-American women. Some have cheered the new dolls. Others jeered them, saying they're not black enough. ""I love the black Barbie. It's about time,"" Jua Simpson said on CNN's iReport, a user-generated news community. ""But the hair is still a step backwards, since most of our hair is not straight and light brown."" Others disagree with critics who say the dolls should have had more natural black hairstyles, such as afros or braids. ""Many people have criticized the dolls for either having hair that's too long or too straight, but I have long, straight hair that I straightened. But it's my hair and a part of me,"" said Tanisa Zoe Samuel, an African-American iReporter from the Turks and Caicos, in the Caribbean. ""Black women come in all shades, shapes and varieties that there is just no way to capture everyone with three dolls."" iReport.com: Samuel shares her thoughts on the new Barbie . The dolls were created by Stacy McBride-Irby, an African-American who watched her daughter play with dolls and wanted to create a doll that looked more like her. McBride-Irby said she has heard the criticism, but she also has received many kudos. ""They mean so much to me because they did come from a positive place,"" McBride-Irby said. ""My daughter loves the dolls. I've had dads thank me for creating this line of dolls that represent their little girls. These dolls are for girls all over the world."" This is not the first time Mattel has released an ethnic doll that drew criticism.  See photos of the black Barbie dolls » . In 1997, Mattel collaborated with cookie maker Nabisco to create Oreo Fun Barbie. The black version of the doll, which sported an Oreo-shaped purse, was criticized by some who noted that ""Oreo"" is a derogatory term in the black community. The word is used to describe someone who is perceived as black on the outside and white on the inside. For some, the talk about dolls is not just child's play. Some think early play with dolls can affect a girl's self-esteem later in life. Actress Nia Long, who appears in comedian Chris Rock's new documentary, ""Good Hair,"" recently talked about the issue on CNN. ""Historically, the Afrocentric features have not been celebrated,"" Long said. ""This makes us question the integrity of our beauty standard for ourselves.""",0.5040264,8567
44,"(CNN) -- Decorating in the midst of a financial recession is not easy. But Thom Filicia, host of the Style Network's ""Dress My Nest,"" author of ""Thom Filicia Style"" and former cast member of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" insists that it can be done. ""Paint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality,"" Thom Filicia says. ""I always tell people, 'Start with what you have.' Work as much with what you have as possible, and then fill in where necessary,"" Filicia said. CNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best. CNN: When you walk into a room that you're going to redesign, where does your mind first go? Thom Filicia: I look at the layout, I look at the way the space is being used, and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is; that it works really well, it looks good, that you're getting the best views, you're seeing the space, and that you're getting through the space. CNN: And that's focusing mainly on furniture? Filicia: That really focuses on all the furniture. You want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works. Even if it's great-looking stuff, it sometimes doesn't look as good as it can look. CNN: What can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have? Filicia: Make sure that your furniture layout works. Make sure that the things you love to look at, you're seeing. Make sure things aren't cluttered. Paint is very affordable. Pick a color that has life and personality. You could do an accent wall behind your sofa. You could use a low-[volatile organic compound] paint so it's environmentally friendly. You can use inexpensive up lights. You put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree. You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall. And then plug your lamps into the Lutron dimmer, and you can dim the whole room. CNN: As far as accessories go, like flowers and pillows, where do you draw the line on too much or not enough? Filicia: I like to keep things clean and straightforward. I think one floral arrangement is usually enough, or maybe a couple really small cute little ones. Pillows should function. You want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable. Start with three: one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right. Add a throw, a rug for underfoot. Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical. CNN: What are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break? Filicia: People think that dark walls make a room smaller. It actually makes the space bigger. All the corners recede, and it adds a lot of depth. Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces. CNN: What's the most common mistake that people make? Filicia: People just don't trust their instincts, and they're not willing to take a risk. Have fun with it. It's only decorating. People tend to go with beige and white just because they're afraid or they don't want to make a commitment. CNN: If someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room, what would you tell them to focus on? Filicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room. In a bedroom, the anchor piece is your bed. Start with your anchor piece, and that's where you spend your most money. CNN: You have a new book out now, is that right? Filicia: Yup, I have a book out right now, which is called ""Thom Filicia Style,"" and it's a great book. It's a lot of fun. It's got a lot of great tips in it. It talks about my philosophy; it talks about color and texture. It's a very comprehensive book with case studies. CNN: Can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget? Filicia: It's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs. Also, just turning your lights off when you're not in a room; when you're brushing your teeth not keeping the water running; taking shorter showers. These are all really simple, easy ways that we can all help Mother Earth repair and heal and replenish itself.",0.49406868,2541
45,"(InStyle) -- After years in the bronze age, when sun-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme, fall's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback. Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever. So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night. Daytime equation . 1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. ""Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,"" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look. 2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose. 3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. ""The color looks more natural and lasts longer."" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10). Nighttime equation . 1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches. 2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores). 3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores). 4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red ($11). Makeup artists' favorites . Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. From the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night. Carmindy's neutral picks for day are designed to ""enhance your natural lip color."" For night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Heidi Klum and Jamie-Lynn Sigler.

46,"(Real Simple) -- Here are five great ways to enjoy your summer. Lazing in a hammock is one of the best ways to spend a summer evening. Best way to cut jeans into shorts  -- What better way to declare the start of summer? The key to cutting off jeans is not to go too short too soon. Slip on the jeans and mark the desired length on one leg with chalk. ""Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold,"" says Caroline Calvin, creative director of Levi's. ""Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors. Lay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match."" Repeat as needed to get the length you want. Ninety-degree days? Bring 'em on! The best way to catch fireflies --  How? With womanly wiles: ""Fireflies blink to attract a mate,"" explains naturalist Lynn Havsall, director of programs at the George B. Dorr Museum of Natural History, in Bar Harbor, Maine. ""Males fly around while females sit in trees, in shrubs, or on the ground. So find a female and watch her blinking pattern. Then imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you."" ]A plus: The bugs move slowly, so they're easy to trap in a jar. Punch some holes in the lid and add a little grass and a piece of fruit for moisture. Admire your pretty night-lights till bedtime, then let them go. The best way to run on the beach -- Who needs a treadmill when you have miles of shoreline? Running on the beach can get you into great shape. Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Beware, shoeless Joes. If you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. ""You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,"" says Guss. ""I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes."" Know your sand. ""In soft sand, one mile is like two,"" says Guss. You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers. Pick the right time to run. ""My favorite time is in the evening,"" says Guss. ""The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot."" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights. The best way to get in and out of a hammock -- Everyone looks good lazing in a hammock  -- it's getting in and out that's tricky. To make it less so, try these tips from Penny Waugh, a buyer for http://www.hammocks.com/. • Position your backside toward the hammock's center and tilt back until you reach a 45-degree angle, with the hammock parallel to your rear. • Gently sit back into the hammock and let it level out. • Swing your legs up and stretch them out. • Lie back. Loll. Sigh contentedly. For a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground. Then push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. ""It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,"" says Waugh. ""But it's good for the glutes."" The best way to tie espadrilles -- Apply this lace-up logic from Meghan Cleary, author of ""The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You."" • Slide your foot fully into the shoe and plant it firmly on the floor. • Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are. The calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator. • Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk. Just don't cut off your circulation. • For a streamlined leg, make the final tie in the back. Create a more whimsical look by putting the final tie in front with a small bow. E-mail to a friend .

47,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Look at a Bratz doll. What do you see? Ask that of random shoppers and you might hear it's an empowering role model, a degrading caricature or a harmless piece of plastic. Many parents see Bratz dolls, left, as too racy for their children, and Barbie dolls as representing false ideals. Nine-year-old Ashley Gibbs of Cumming, Georgia, is a fan of the edgy dolls, so it came as an unpleasant surprise that they would soon leave store shelves. ""Ever, ever, ever?"" she asked her mother, Kathryn Adams, after Adams said stores weren't going to sell Bratz after the end of this year. But after a moment of reflection, Ashley seemed relieved. ""Good [thing] I have lots."" Ashley didn't know it, but Bratz are the target of allegations that their creator came up with the concept when he was working for Mattel, the maker of Bratz rival Barbie. Mattel sued Bratz manufacturer MGA Entertainment Inc., and last week a federal judge ordered MGA to cease making the dolls immediately and to stop selling them after the holiday shopping season ends. MGA said it intends to appeal the judge's order and Mattel said it remains open to ""all viable options"" as the matter moves through the courts. The judge's ruling came as a relief to some parents who see the popular dolls' clothes and makeup as too racy for their young daughters. It also eliminates heavy competition against Barbie -- a doll often seen as less provocative, but whose slender body also raises parents' eyebrows. ""I'm happy to not see [Bratz],"" said Kristi Cassell of Sandy Springs, Georgia. Her 5-year-old daughter, Emily, has amassed a collection of Barbies.  Watch mothers and daughters weigh in on the Barbie-Bratz debate » . ""Barbies come across more wholesome,"" Cassell said. Barbie has some ""questionable"" clothes, ""but it seemed like all the Bratz dolls were on a darker side of Barbie,"" she said. Six-year-old Sierra Curry-Corcoran of Newport News, Virginia, also has a Barbie collection and no Bratz dolls. But not by choice. ""I like Bratz better. They have more fancy clothes, and they look more cool,"" Sierra said. Her mother, Tasha Curry-Corcoran, strongly disagrees. ""Bratz are trashy: They wear too much makeup. Their clothing is too short; their boots are too high. They look like prostitutes. That's why we don't have them in our house."" Parents aren't the only ones who have taken aim at Bratz. A 2007 report by the American Psychological Association Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls called Bratz dolls' miniskirts, fishnet stockings and feather boas ""sexualized"" and argued that the dolls' ""objectified sexuality ... is limiting for adolescent girls, and even more so for the very young girls who represent the market for these dolls."" Researchers have criticized Barbie, too. The Mattel dolls represent a ""distortedly thin body ideal,"" and girls experienced ""heightened body dissatisfaction after exposure to Barbie doll images but not after exposure to ... neutral control images,"" according to a 2006 study out of the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom. Cassell acknowledged that Barbie bodies ""are a little unrealistic."" ""But they've been around for generations. I grew up playing with Barbies, and I don't have any physical issues because I had Barbies. I think the adults make a bigger deal out of it than the kids,"" she said. Theresa Hawkesworth of South Africa believes Bratz dolls rather than Barbies are a more positive influence for her 12-year-old daughter, Emma. ""Because their faces and their makeup are so extreme it's almost impossible that a young girl could look like that,"" Hawkesworth said. ""Whereas [with] Barbie dolls, the young girls think that they need that beautiful hair and that beautiful body, and when they don't look like a Barbie they have that poor self-image."" Over the years Emma has accumulated a dozen Bratz dolls, in addition to Bratz shirts, pajamas, posters, computer games and a rolling backpack. ""It's too bad for other girls"" that they're leaving the marketplace, Emma said. As a preteen, Emma feels too old for Barbies, although she still appreciates the style of Bratz. But she doesn't want to emulate that style. ""It looks nice on the dolls, but I would prefer to just wear my own makeup,"" she said. Emma's mother said her daughter's interest in Bratz actually helps the girl maintain her innocence. The branded clothing is ""more innocent, feminine and girly than a see-through or immodest top,"" Hawkesworth said. Ashley's mother had been hesitant to let Ashley or her other daughter, 6-year-old Kate Gibbs, play with Bratz, but she relented when they received them as gifts. Adams had been ""definitely a little bit more of a Barbie fan,"" but, ""I don't want them to buy into the mentality that they've got to look like a Bratz doll or a Barbie doll,"" she said. Ashley seems to be resisting the influence of the Bratz style. ""They have lots of makeup and I don't want that much makeup,"" she said. ""I like casual things, not the big pretty things."" To which Adams later beamed, ""Yes! Proud mom!"" CNN's Sean O'Key contributed to this report.",0.46646324,3617
48,"(CNN)  -- We are often asked to declare our identity for documents, applications, bank loans and even social networking sites. But how much of our identity is lost when we select ""female,"" ""African-American"" or ""Muslim?"" I think much of my own identity is lost when I fill in those boxes. I am technically a white, male, heterosexual, Christian, upper-class Ph.D. student. But I am more than meets the eye. I'm covered in tattoos and piercings, and this often leads to assumptions about my character. ""Is he a drug addict? Is he a skinhead? Does he play music for a band?"" I am none of these things. The lesson I hope to teach others through my life is that it's important to see past appearances. My sociopolitical views are a large part of my identity, and I incorporate these into what I wear; whether it's T-shirts emblazoned with the images of activists whom I admire or deliberately manipulating my demeanor to reflect the ""professorial"" role I assume in the classroom, I am continually aware that others are reading my presentation as a measure of my character. And it is to this end that I deliberately try to throw people off. I hope to debunk some of the myths surrounding tattoos and piercings. And I know that everyone who interacts with me is left wondering how someone so ""deviant-looking"" can be kind, courteous and hospitable. My body is also a billboard for my life, and my tattoos tell the story of my identity. My earliest tattoos were direct quotes and Bible verses and captured my identity as an outspoken social-justice advocate. I began to display my political views more directly in later tattoos. I have the ""female"" sign behind my left ear to reflect my commitment to feminism and women everywhere; I have the Human Rights Campaign logo behind my right ear to reflect my commitment to LGBT struggles. The tattoos on my arms capture my commitment to ""faith,"" ""family"" and ""mom and dad."" I also have a bald eagle on my forearm to reflect my commitment to making this country a better place and a skull wearing a graduation cap to reflect my lifelong commitment to teaching. I know that my appearance is misleading, and I know that many people would disagree with what I see as efficacious inscriptions. But one thing is for certain: I will not blend in with the crowd. I will be noticed, for better or worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Paul Strohecker.",0.4508156,9874
49,"(RealSimple.com) -- Overwashing, overapplying, and product overkill won't improve your skin. Rein in your regimen to get real results. Want beautiful skin like model Megan Gale? Don't overdo it, experts say. Cleansing and exfoliating . You don't need to wash or scrub as often -- or as vigorously -- as you may think. ""Many women go overboard here, figuring it will make their skin look better if they do both more frequently,"" says dermatologist Leslie Baumann. ""But that only damages the skin's natural barrier and creates dryness and irritation."" Combination skin . How often: Wash your face twice a day, and gently exfoliate once or twice a week; this is enough to keep skin balanced and encourage cell turnover, according to experts. What to look for: A mild cleanser that isn't too rich or too drying, says Mary Lupo, a dermatologist in New Orleans, Louisiana. Use an exfoliant that contains gentle particles or acids to remove dead cells without abrading your skin. Where to find it: Cleanser -- Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, $6 at drugstores. Exfoliant -- St. Ives Elements Microdermabrasion Scrub, $7 at drugstores. Dry skin . How often: Cleanse skin at night, when it's dirtiest. Rinse with cool water in the morning to help maintain natural oils. If skin is flaky, exfoliate once a week, says Lisa Donofrio, a professor of dermatology at Yale University. What to look for: A cleansing oil or creamy wash that has moisturizing ingredients, such as glycerin. If you have sensitive skin to boot, avoid products that contain fragrances or alcohol, which can irritate. Where to find it: Cleanser -- Laura Mercier Purifying Oil, $40, www.sephora.com; or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, $11.50 at drugstores. Exfoliant -- Your safest bet is to use a wet washcloth. Oily/acne-prone skin . How often: Lather up two to three times a day (as needed) but never more; overwashing kicks oil glands into overproduction. Exfoliate once or twice a week, but skip this if you have acne; the friction can make it worse. What to look for: An oil-free, non-comedogenic foaming cleanser that contains salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to prevent breakouts. The scrub should contain mild acids to keep the pores open and clean. Where to find it: Cleanser -- Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, $7 at drugstores. Exfoliant -- Bioré Pore Unclogging Scrub, $6 at drugstores. Sensitive skin . How often: Wash once a day if your skin is irritated by nearly everything or if you have eczema or psoriasis; twice a day if your skin is dirty. Forget about exfoliating, as it's too abrasive for your skin type. What to look for: Hypoallergenic and fragrance- and soap-free cleansers. Calming ingredients, like green tea, chamomile, feverfew, and aloe, are a bonus. As a general rule, the fewer ingredients in a product, the better. Where to find it: Cleanser -- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser ($19.50, www.laroche-posay.com). Apply with your fingers. ""Think of the way you'd touch a newborn,"" says Barbara Reed, a Denver, Colorado, dermatologist. Portion control . • Use a quarter-size amount of cleanser on most skin types. • A dime-size dollop of scrub will do. • A pea-size dab of cleanser is plenty for sensitive skin. Real Simple: Best facial cleansers . Moisturizing and protecting . No matter what your skin type, moisture is important. ""If your skin isn't hydrated, it can't protect itself from the free radicals that cause damage, discoloration, and wrinkles,"" says dermatologist Leslie Baumann. Year-round daily sun protection is also a must. Fortunately there are moisturizers with SPF available for every complexion. Combination skin . How often: Each morning, apply moisturizer with SPF after cleansing your skin. Reapply if you're spending more than 30 minutes outside, as sun-screens break down in sunlight over time. What to look for: A medium-weight lotion with skin-protective antioxidants, such as green tea, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin C, and broad-spectrum sun protection with an SPF of 15 or higher. Where to find it: L'Oréal Paris Revitalift UV Daily Moisturizing Cream with Mexoryl SX SPF 15, $22 at drugstores; or Clinique Super-defense SPF 25 Age Defense Moisturizer Dry Combination, $43, www.clinique.com. Dry skin . How often: To help seal in water, apply moisturizer with SPF once a day, right after cleansing, while your skin is still damp. Reapply at midday if your skin begins to feel tight, and use a cream at night. What to look for: A rich cream that contains antioxidants, plus hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides. ""Hyaluronic acid and glycerin bind in moisture, and ceramides prevent water loss from the skin,"" says Donofrio. Where to find it: Dove Pro Age Day Moisturizer SPF 15, $14 at drugstores; or Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15, $10.50 at drugstores. Oily/acne-prone skin . How often: Moisturize every morning. Oily skin needs the right type of moisture and lightweight, non-comedogenic sun protection. Reapply as needed, since blotting away shine can remove sunscreen. What to look for: An oil-free, featherweight lotion, serum, or gel with antioxidants. If you're acne-prone, avoid products with cocoa butter, cinnamon, or coconut oil, as they can trigger breakouts, says Baumann. Where to find it: DDF Ultra-Lite Oil-Free Moisturizing Dew SPF 15, $38, www.ddfskincare.com; or Clean & Clear Soft Oil-Free Day Moisturizer SPF 15, $8.50 at drugstores. Sensitive skin . How often: In the morning, apply moisturizer to skin that has been dabbed dry. Ingredients penetrate wet skin more deeply, which is often a good thing, but this can irritate sensitive skin. What to look for: Fragrance-free lotions or creams that contain anti-inflammatories, such as chamomile, green tea, feverfew, and caffeine. Avoid lipoic acid, as it can be irritating. Where to find it: Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Moisture Lotion SPF 15, $14 at drugstores; or Dermalogica Super Sensitive Faceblock SPF 30, $45, www.dermalogica.com for locations. Portion control . Use a nickel-to quarter-size amount of moisturizer with SPF for face coverage. Real Simple: Seventeen affordable moisturizers . Treating and troubleshooting . Nighttime is best for targeting fine lines, blemishes, and discoloration. That's when the skin repairs itself, and the sun isn't around to degrade the active ingredients in the treatments. Careful and consistent use of effective products (most also provide moisture) will gradually yield great results. Combination skin . To keep it smooth: Four nights a week, use a cream with retinol, a potent, tried-and-true wrinkle reducer. Try: Philosophy Help Me Retinol Night Treatment, $45, www.philosophy.com. To clear it up: Use a 5 percent benzoyl peroxide or 2 percent salicylic acid gel nightly. Try: B. Kamins Medicated Acne Gel 5, $26, www.bkamins.com; or Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Eliminating Gel, $8 at drugstores. To even tone: Retinol evens tone, but for darker spots, at night use a formula that also has skin-lightening licorice, kojic acid, soy, or vitamin C. Try: RoC Multi-Correxion Night Treatment, $25 at drugstores. Dry skin . To keep it smooth: As dry skin can be sensitive, apply gentle retinols every other night with a moisturizer. Try: Avène Rétrinal Cream .05, $56, www.skincarerx.com. Other nights, just moisturize. To clear it up: Heal blemishes using a moisturizing 2 percent salicylic acid treatment or a sulfur-based salve once or twice a week. Try: AcneWorx Gentle Moisturizing Clear Acne Treatment Gel, $20, www.amazon.com. To even tone: Slather on a rich cream that contains skin-brightening ingredients, like coffeeberry extract, each night. Try: RevaléSkin Night Cream, $99, www.skincarerx.com. Oily/acne-prone skin . To keep it smooth: Nightly use of a retinol gel or serum softens fine lines (skip it on nights you treat blemishes, as below). Try: Replenix Retinol Plus Smoothing Serum 3X, $56, www.skincarerx.com. To clear it up: Oily skin can take a 5 or 10 percent benzoyl peroxide gel twice a day, says Sonia Badreshia-Bansal, a dermatologist in Danville, California. Try: Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 10, $5 at drugstores. To even tone: Each night smooth a thin layer of a lightweight vitamin C serum over your face to gradually lighten any discoloration. Try: Avon Anew Alternative Clearly C 10% Vitamin C Serum, $20, www.avon.com. Sensitive skin . To keep it smooth: Every third night, apply a mild retinol (see dry skin). Or use peptides nightly on lines. Try: Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment, $18 at drugstores. To clear it up: Treat blemishes with a 2 percent salicylic acid treatment and follow with moisturizer. Try: Exuviance Blemish Treatment Gel, $16, www.exuviance.com. Avoid benzoyl peroxide, which can be irritating. To even tone: Consider a nightly application of a lotion with a gentle lightener, like a niacin derivative or vitamin C. Try: NIA 24 Intensive Recovery Complex, $110, www.skincarerx.com. Portion control . • A pea-size amount of a retinol cream is adequate. • A dime-size dollop of a skin brightener or moisturizer will do the trick. • A sunflower seed--size dot of an acne salve is all your spots require.
