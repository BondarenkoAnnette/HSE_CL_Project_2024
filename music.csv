0,"NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- A singer took center stage at a Nashville honky-tonk to promote his new album. He had the good looks and easy charm of a movie star. Kevin Costner is putting his energies into music. His new record is ""Untold Truths."" Only in this case, he was a movie star. Kevin Costner recently celebrated the release of ""Untold Truths"" -- his debut country record -- with a free show at The Stage on Broadway. He was backed by his band, Modern West, which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class. The three have been making music on and off since then, with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Back in the day, they called themselves Roving Boy. Truth be told, the 2008 incarnation -- Kevin Costner and Modern West -- does not sound like a movie star's vanity project. It's contemporary Americana set against a Western backdrop. Costner sings about freight trains, dusty avenues and broken dreams in a voice that's pleasant, if not terribly distinct. In faded jeans and a toffee-colored cashmere sweater, he commands the stage with the same understated sex appeal he has on the big screen. At 53, Costner is the soft-spoken, heroic everyman we've seen time and again in such movies as ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Field of Dreams"" -- except today he's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat. The mission statement from ""Field of Dreams"" seems to apply to his philosophy as a recording artist: ""If you build it, they will come."" Plenty of fans did come to his show that night, but earlier in the day, we caught up with the busy superstar during his rehearsal -- which he had opened up to a group of local college students in a Grammy-sponsored ""SoundCheck"" session.  Listen to Costner kick it with his band » . CNN: Even though your album, ""Untold Truths,"" is being marketed as a country album, your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country. Kevin Costner: Yeah. It's just music. CNN: What made you decide to put out an album? Costner: My wife said, ""Look, you are the happiest by far when you are making music. Why don't you keep on making music?"" CNN: People may not know this, but you've been making music for a long time. Costner: Yeah, for a long time. I have been doing a lot of things for a long time. (chuckles) It's not like we called up and said, ""Hey, we have a garage band. Can we show up?"" We have been working really hard at this for three years. All of it has been under the radar just because we have not felt like publicizing it. It has kind of happened in the way we wanted it to -- which was more of a grassroots situation, people discovering the band. CNN: When you were talking to the students, you spoke a lot about being fearless. Costner: Their choices are going to be questioned not only by their colleagues, but by their parents. You only get one shot at this life. They can go to college and learn a lot of things, but they should also be encouraged to try things, even if they don't succeed. I am trying -- even if I don't succeed. You know, failure is completely underrated in America. (smiles) CNN: With this new project, there's the possibility of having your head handed to you on a platter. Costner: Well, that will happen no matter what I do -- so I'm not worried about that. I have to get over my own bar on what I think is acceptable. CNN: And what is that? Costner: I don't know. It's just a moment when you feel you've given an honest effort. CNN: You have trouble stuffing everything you want into a three-hour movie, let alone condensing things into a three-minute song. How do you -- . Costner: I don't have that hard a time! CNN: Oh, come on! Costner: I make jokes about it a lot. You know, I make one-hour, 59-minute movies! But yeah -- telling the story, I don't believe in some conditional running length. I just believe in telling the story -- musicially or cinematically. CNN: You met John -- one of your guitar players -- in an acting class 20 years ago. Costner: Yeah, a long time ago. Blair (his bass player), the same. Like anybody with good sense, you keep people who have been really true and honest with you around you. CNN: Which is more cutthroat, the movie business or the music business? Costner: There is cutthroat stuff in everything -- these corporations going under, and people ducking for exits, pointing fingers. You know, it is a cycle of life. Then someone else will take that spot, some heavy hitter. Maybe it is good to take a lesson. You have to be a little humble because maybe one day, you are not that big, swinging dog you think you are. CNN: Do you ever feel like that in your own career? Costner: Well, I am aware that a career that takes chances isn't always going to ring a bell. It is not the greatest risk in the world to not be the most popular person, or the number one person, because that is a pretty fleeting thing to begin with. CNN: Do you read reviews? Costner: No. Sometimes they are read to me. ""Look what he said!"" I am like, ""Please don't show me."" CNN: Are you planning to make more albums? Costner: I will be making more music. We'll see where it lands. We made a record. We made it as good as we could make it, and now we let it go. And we go and write a better song. CNN: In the meantime, you have a show to put on. Costner: There is a moment for two hours when you are really burning, and that is a great feeling. Some people like to jog because that somehow does something for them. When you perform, for me, it's like filling up the gas tank.",0.8276878,2823
2,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Mat Kearney has every right to be frustrated. Mat Kearney's music has gotten a boost through music video channels and ""Grey's Anatomy."" As he walks to his tour bus behind Hollywood's Palladium -- where he'll play in a few hours -- he's already had to cope with logistical snafus, shortened sound checks and general confusion. And the tour is just beginning. There are more than 30 cities and 10 weeks to come. But as he approaches the bus, he is completely overtaken by an obscure flower hanging off a fence behind the venue. ""I've never seen anything like that,"" he says, looking at the blue-and-white bloom. ""I've got to take one of these."" Kearney should be smelling the flowers. His music, such as the song ""Nothing Left to Lose,"" has received consistent airplay on music TV channels -- which earned him a headlining slot on a VH1-sponsored tour -- and repeated appearances in TV and film. Most notably, ""Grey's Anatomy"" used his song ""Breathe In, Breathe Out."" His new album, ""City of Black & White"" (Aware/Columbia), is out Tuesday.  Watch the video for the single ""Closer to Love"" » . The Oregon-born musician, 30, sat down with CNN to talk about his songwriting journey, combining a big sound with personal observations and a certain ""weird TV show."" The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: How important was Nashville, Tennessee, in your decision to be a songwriter? Mat Kearney: The first year I moved to Nashville, I started playing these songwriter nights with people like Nickel Creek, Duncan Sheik and even Ryan Adams. ... That was the first place I really started playing music and I had to really step up my game. Really quick. Or get kicked off the stage. CNN: This whirlwind world tour you completed last year -- how did it impact this new album and you personally? Kearney: That tour was three years long. [So] this record was a return back to community in Nashville and to sing. ... So, [the tour] created this void for wanting to connect in a local way. So many things happen when you're not out there running and gunning. Falling in love with someone, getting your heart broken, being around friends -- that stuff can only happen when you stick around for a while. CNN: What's the significance of the title -- ""City of Black & White""? Kearney: The title track I wrote in Istanbul. We stayed in this place that overlooked the Bosporus, which splits Europe from Asia. The song is about worlds colliding, being that far away from home, and also longing to be with someone you love in that distant land. ... It seemed like a good cornerstone to build the record on. CNN: You're an avid traveler, but this record is more concerned with planting roots. How do you reconcile the two? Kearney: I don't think, to be a traveler, you have to reject setting roots up. That's the fun of this whole journey for me. There are people I love in Nashville and would not want to go a day without talking to, but I want to see the world. The record is coming out of an experience of reconciling those two things. I played 275 shows for two years straight. You have to travel between those shows. So you're gone. Some of those experiences shape the record. There's a romantic side to it. This isn't a one-night stand record. It's not youthful idealism that's going after the masses. There's some ideas of, say, that prodigal son who has walked away from you and you're sitting there saying, ""I'm here for you if you need me."" CNN: The sound is big but the lyrics are intensely personal. How did you meld those ideas together? Kearney: Yeah, it's like the biggest song is one of the most personal. ""Fire and Rain"" [not the James Taylor song] is a crazy four-on-the-floor song, but it's a song about someone who has left you. Something about the juxtaposition of those two seem so interesting to me. I didn't plan it. It just kind of happened. CNN: You're one of the last musicians I have seen actually get airplay on [music television channels], and you broke through because of it. Kearney: It's interesting how my music has gained success being accompanied by images. When I was in college I wanted to study film. My first passion was to be a cinematographer. So maybe there's something innate in my music where it partners well with images. It's worked on weird TV shows where doctors are making out and people getting logs pulled out of their stomachs [laughs]. Somehow my music seems to work with that. CNN: How did your music become such an integral part of that show [""Grey's Anatomy""]? Kearney: I really don't know. Somebody somewhere ... started using these songs and they seem to work. There are certain songs that lend themselves to images. No one's licensing [Katy Perry's] ""I Kissed a Girl"" and putting it in shows. That's a narrow-focused message that doesn't need much [in the way of] images.",0.8248163,5024
3,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Heidi Newfield goes into Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards with five nominations. It's more than any other female, but she still considers herself the dark horse -- and in many ways, she is, especially since she's up for top female vocalist against such heavyweights as Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift. Heidi Newfield says she considers herself an underdog at Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards. For 10 years, Newfield was the lead singer of the honky-tonk trio Trick Pony. Her soulful debut solo album, ""What Am I Waiting for,"" was released in August to stellar reviews -- many from critics who scoffed at the high-energy antics of her former band. If you spend any time with the petite blonde from Northern California, you're struck by how many times she says, ""Please"" and ""Thank you."" There's a smile for everyone -- waiters, doormen, cameramen -- and she steers conversation away from herself to ask how others are doing. Newfield is a nice girl. But her life changed when a fellow musician told her to stop being so nice, as she revealed in the following interview with CNN:  Watch Newfield talk about her nominations » . CNN: What went through your head when you received five nominations for this year's Academy of Country Music Awards? Heidi Newfield: I thought one or two would be so fabulous, that would be so great. And they kept calling my name, and you know, I won't lie -- I'm going to tell on my husband -- the tears started flowing, and we were just really happy. All the hard work, all the time, and all the road -- and just the experience over time starts to play back in your mind, just like a movie.This is a really special time. CNN: Was it validation that leaving Trick Pony was the right thing to do? Newfield: People tell you, ""You can't do this."" You know in country music oftentimes it does not work when a front person leaves a group. In other genres -- pop, rock, hip-hop and rap -- people can leave all the time and do amazing things on their own. Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Sting -- there's a gazillion people. But in country, we have that tight-knit, almost family relationship with our fans, so when you change something up, they don't always like that very much. CNN: Did you feel guilty about leaving Trick Pony? Newfield: No, not an ounce of guilt. I left Trick Pony with my head held high. I felt like I left with total dignity and class, and I didn't leave anybody hanging. I fulfilled every obligation, no matter how hard it was -- and it was hard. There was a lot of drama, and they weren't exactly happy with me. I don't mind saying this, but it was miserable the last several months. But my intuition was saying it's time to make a change. So did I stay too long? I don't know. I mean, everything happens for a reason. Had I left three years ago, maybe I wouldn't have been the same person I am today. CNN: John Popper from Blues Traveler kind of gave you a kick in the pants. Newfield: Oh, I love Poppy! We talk all the time, I kid you not. John was on a USO tour with us for 2½ weeks, so we got to know each other really well. Every night, he would come on stage and do a [harmonica] number with me. On the last night of the tour, we were in Germany, and we were at this pub, and Poppy said to me, ""You love this, and it's clear you're a musician -- but you need to learn to stop being so nice. You need to speak your mind and step up and step up for yourself."" His actual words were, ""When you learn to be a b----,"" that's what he told me. And I thought, ""Well, my philosophy is I don't think you ever, ever, ever have to be a diva or a prima donna to make it to a certain level."" I think you can always treat people with respect and be nice, and I always plan on doing that. But what he said was right. When you start to believe in yourself, that's when there's no limit to what you can do. CNN: Your debut solo album, ""What Am I Waiting for,"" shows a lot of growth. It's much more introspective and mature, whereas Trick Pony's music was brash and not as multidimensional. Newfield: When my producer Tony Brown and I first sat down to talk about making this album, one of the first things that came out of his mouth was, ""We have to show people who you really are. We need to cut songs, and you need to explore parts of your vocals that you never got a change to showcase."" All the ACM nominations are validation that we are on the path to doing just that and being taken seriously as an artist -- as a singer, as a songwriter and as a musician. We made a record that made people say, ""Hey, this girl can sing."" And that's what I had always hoped. CNN: Still, it's a building process, and in a lot of ways, you're starting from scratch. Newfield: At this one fair that I went to, they had my name spelled H-e-d-y instead of H-e-i-d-i. Hedy Newfield. And I thought, ""Oh, that's just great."" And, of course, you go up to the promoter and say, ""Come on, hook a sister up here."" So we're fixing that. CNN: Of the five awards you're up for at the ACMs, you have to be most thrilled about top female vocalist. [Newfield is up against Underwood, Swift, Lee Ann Womack and Miranda Lambert.) Newfield: I'm the biggest dark horse ever. I'm the big underdog, but I like to be the underdog. I hope the makeup's rockin'. I hope I look good at that moment when they call out, ""Carrie Underwood.""",0.81820637,2329
5,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The home life Diana Krall shares with husband (and fellow musical brain) Elvis Costello and their 2-year-old twin boys is a little nutty. Diana Krall's new album, ""Quiet Nights,"" was inspired by a trip she made to Brazil. ""It's zany in the most wonderful way,"" says the 44-year-old jazz singer-pianist. ""You have two little boys leaping off the furniture who think they're Buzz Lightyear while we're practicing and playing. It's just a happy house."" Krall's domestic bliss -- ""domestic"" being a new concept for the ever-touring artist -- is suggested in the warm, intimate vibe of her latest album ""Quiet Nights."" ""It's a very natural process for me, making a record. It ends up being a reflection of where I am at that time. My life is just tremendous right now. It couldn't be better,"" she says. No kidding. ""Quiet Nights"" debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 album charts last week, a career high for Krall. A memorable trip to Brazil in 2007 inspired the Canadian chanteuse to take her 12th album in a bossa nova direction: The title track is the English version of the bossa nova classic ""Corcovado."" She also covers ""The Girl from Ipanema"" -- though naturally in her whispery rendition she flips ""girl"" to ""boy"" -- and gives a fresh spin on Frank Sinatra's ""Where or When.""  Watch Krall find bliss in Brazil » . ""There was something about turning 'Where or When' into a bossa nova that changes the feeling for me of the song,"" Krall said. ""It's much more emotional than if I sang it in a swing feeling. I've always experimented with that."" Krall brought arranger and conductor Claus Ogerman on board. He was a natural, having worked with Sinatra and Brazilian singer-songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim who wrote both ""Ipanema"" and ""Corcovado."" And Krall co-produced the album with frequent collaborator Tommy LiPuma. ""One of the best parts of making a record is the dinner after where you all you go to the restaurant, you decompress, have some great wine and just tell stories and listen to Claus and Tommy and [engineer] Al Schmidt and all these people telling amazing stories,"" says Krall. Diana Krall recently sat down with CNN to share some stories of her own about a teenaged letter to Oscar Peterson, idolizing Harry Connick Jr. and Mickey Mouse pancakes. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: This is the first album you've made since becoming a mother. Does it feel different somehow? Diana Krall: I think [this album reflects my present] state of mind. It's not about loss, it's not preparing for loss. I'm not peeling grapes. Life has changed a lot and it's not just about performing and touring. It's motherhood and having a home for the first time, because I've always been on the road. So it's an incredible thing to be making Mickey Mouse pancakes in the morning while you're doing your interviews. CNN: You've been producing Barbara Streisand's new album. What has that been like? Krall: Incredible. I just am so thrilled with her performance on this album. [She gives] one of the most incredible performances I think of her career on a song called ""You Must Believe in Spring"" with a great pianist from New York named Phil Charlap. It's just piano and voice and it's so incredibly stunning. She said to me, ""Maybe it needs some strings or something."" I said ""Don't touch it! Just leave it! It's gorgeous!"" It's been great working artist to artist and we had a lot of fun. We played cards. So when there were moments in the studio where there was something technical that had to be fixed, we'd deal the cards and we'd play gin rummy, which I'm lousy at. Thank goodness. CNN: This is the first album you've produced for another artist. Way to choose somebody really small to start off with. Krall: She chose me! I had a few phone calls and it was a little daunting, but it was a great experience and really, really intense, as you would expect it to be. CNN: Some people were a little put out by your record ""The Girl in the Other Room"" because you strayed from jazz. How did you process that reaction? Krall: Somebody's always put out with anything I do (laughs). ""Why'd you do 'The Look of Love?' "" ""Why don't you do 'The Look of Love' again?"" I don't know! I'm too busy trying to put the Lego back in the box, and making sure nobody's eating all the Play-Doh. That record did very well and a lot of people say to me, ""That's my favorite record."" And I wrote [it] with my husband, so I don't really look back. I look forward. And I've got a pretty loyal audience. CNN: What would you say to your sons if they tell you they want to be musicians when they grow up? Krall: They should do whatever makes them happy. This is what they know so if that's what they choose to do -- who knows. They could be like my mom and my dad and be a teacher-librarian and a chartered accountant. That's fine too. A month ago I found this letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson when I was 16 years old and my mom had saved it for me and put it in a box in the attic. It was a five-page letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson saying, ""Dear Oscar, I'm 16 years old and I hear a professional musician's life is a very difficult one but I know this is the only life I want to have."" And it was really enlightening for me to see the focus of a 16-year-old. It reminded me of how much I love the music and always wanted to do what I'm doing, so how lucky am I? CNN: But it's not all luck. Krall: I think it's a lot of luck. I think I started in a very good time. When I went to see that film ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and I heard Harry Connick playing the piano, I though there's somebody who's my age and he's playing the music that I love. And I felt like there was a kindred spirit and it inspired me to go, ""I want to do exactly what he's doing."" And I still owe a lot of thanks to Harry. I've only met him like a couple of times, but he's still a favorite artist of mine.",0.81518495,3082
6,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Rob Thomas is a busy guy -- so busy, he apparently hasn't had much time to check in with his Matchbox Twenty bandmates. Rob Thomas prefers to focus on the ""musician"" side of his career, rather than ""celebrity."" We only know this because we ran into guitarist Paul Doucette at the BMI Pop Awards in Beverly Hills several weeks ago, where he was picking up a plaque for songwriter of the year. ""We're interviewing Rob about his solo album,"" I told him. ""Hey,"" Doucette exclaimed. ""Tell that guy to call me, would you? I didn't even know he was in L.A.!"" By the time we met up with Thomas the next day, he and Doucette had already connected over drinks somewhere between midnight and the morning -- musician's hours. Thomas recently released ""Cradlesong,"" his second solo CD. Even though he's clearly excited about it, he spends as much time talking about Matchbox Twenty as he does the solo album he's in town to promote. For the 37-year-old singer-songwriter, it's all interconnected. One has fed into the other since he gained household name status a decade ago, after scoring a massive, Grammy-winning hit with Carlos Santana on ""Smooth.""  Watch Thomas describe the difference between being a celebrity and a musician » . The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Who has given you the best piece of advice? Rob Thomas: Carlos [Santana] will constantly send you messages out of nowhere. Carlos will call me at 10 at night and be like, ""Listen, I had a dream about you, and so much good is happening, but there's dark forces at work, and when you get out of here, I have this woman who wants to cleanse you."" I think Carlos' most important piece of advice ever was that he taught me the difference between being a celebrity and being a famous musician. CNN: But some artists don't have that kind of success, and they try for celebrity instead. Thomas: Sure, and sometimes that works -- but none of my favorites have done that. I remember when Matchbox Twenty started years ago, and we had a lot of success, but nobody knew who we were. The first time we did an interview with MTV, it was about how no one knew who we were. We had sold 8 million records. I don't know if we were being naive at the time, but we thought we'd won because our songs were more famous than we were. I'm much more known for the music that I make than what I do with my life. It's never, ""Oh yeah, I've been seeing you in [the New York Post gossip column] Page Six at these clubs that you go to"" or ""I know who you're sleeping with."" CNN: When you became famous for being Rob Thomas the solo artist, did that cause problems within the band? Thomas: No. I think the guys would rather it be me than them. None of them want the job, and they realize that it's working now. They have a singer. I can go out and do it [publicity] for them, and they're fine with it. They can stay home. I think there's nothing more attractive than wealth and anonymity. If I'm not out supporting my work, I really don't want people to see me. I go to movie premieres -- my wife and I -- all the time, and nine out of 10 of those movie premieres, much to my publicist's dismay, I get there, but I sneak around the pictures and get into the party [using the back entrance]. If I have a record coming out, I'll go in front of the cameras, and I'll say, ""Hi! Hey, I'm at this movie premiere."" I liken it to being a switch that I can move on and off. CNN: What has doing a solo project enabled you to do that you can't do with a band? Thomas: I get to pick my own schedule, and that's nice. Matchbox Twenty -- it's four lead singers, there's four front men, and everybody's tastes, everybody's schedule, everybody's personal life comes into account when you're doing something like that. We all live [in four different cities] ... so we literally have to pull ourselves up from all over the country and go somewhere, just to get us into a room to write. And you have to not think you're so great so you don't get upset when somebody doesn't like your stuff. Like ""Her Diamonds"" -- one of the singles on this solo album -- is one of my favorite songs that I've ever written, and the guys loved the song, but didn't want to play it. [They said,] ""When you do a new solo record, you should put it on there. It doesn't sound like a song we would do right now."" And they were right. When we put together the last Matchbox record, it was much more of a rock record. CNN: What's the most surprising thing on your iPod? Thomas: Britney Spears. Come on! ""Toxic,"" man, is just one of the baddest tracks ever! I remember the first time we listened to ""... Baby One More Time."" ... We were like, ""Oh, let's go play Britney Spears on the piano!"" And we all come over drinking, and after a couple of minutes, we're like, ""This Britney Spears is a lot harder than we thought!"" CNN: Whose career would you like to emulate? Thomas: Tom Petty is a famous musician. He's not a music celebrity. When Tom Petty walks down the street, you know that it's Tom Petty, but it would be like, ""Oh my gosh, it's Tom Petty! I love Tom Petty, right on!"" It would never be like, ""Aaaaaaaah!"" -- and 3 million teenage girls follow him down the street.",0.8048537,5617
8,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- After a long apprenticeship, it's been an astonishingly fast rise for R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan. Jazmine Sullivan is up for five Grammys next month, including best new artist. Before she was in her teens, Sullivan sang on ""It's Showtime at the Apollo."" At 13, she met Stevie Wonder. Soon she was performing regularly at the jam sessions called Black Lily in her hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She went to that city's performing arts high school and was signed to a contract by Jive Records, where she was paired with producers such as Timbaland and Cool & Dre. It didn't work out -- then. But soon, Sullivan signed with Clive Davis' J Records, and suddenly she was everywhere. Her debut single, ""Need U Bad,"" hit No. 1 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and her album ""Fearless"" hit the Top 10 on Billboard's album chart. Now she's up for five Grammys on February 8, including best R&B performance (for ""Bust Your Windows"") and best new artist. CNN's KJ Matthews talked with Sullivan about her inspirations, who she's bringing to the Grammys and the mysterious person behind ""Bust Your Windows."" The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: How would you describe your sound? Jazmine Sullivan: I can't really describe it; that's the whole thing. Once you hear the CD, you'll hear that one sound doesn't sound like the next. You know, I've been influenced by so many different styles and different genres of music that I felt like that should be represented on my first album, so when you get it, you get a taste of gospel, jazz, R&B, hip-hop, reggae, pop ... everything is on there, there's something for everybody to enjoy. I didn't want to exclude anybody from the album. CNN: Let me ask you this: When you saw or heard the other nominees in the best new artist category who happen to be a little bit more well-known, was it intimidating? I mean, you got the Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Adele ... Sullivan: Yeah, the Jonas Brothers, specifically. I didn't even know they were new artists because they are so huge, so, you know, so after, when my name was called after theirs, I thought, ""Wow, they're new artists, too?"" I got a little scared, I tell you that. But I'm just so honored to be mentioned to be in the same categories with such wonderful artists, so I'm looking forward to February and the Grammys and just being in that atmosphere. CNN: I was looking at your background, and I didn't know that you're a protegee of Missy Elliott. I was thinking to myself, you would think that you would do rap, but you're this big voice, this soulful voice. You might not equate that with Missy. Sullivan: Yeah, and a lot of people don't know that Missy Elliott ... grew up in the church, and she's really into vocalists. When I met her, was I was about 13 or 14, [and] she was ecstatic about me. When nobody else was there to support me, Missy was there, so she's a good friend of mine, and I'm happy to have her by my side. She's definitely taught me a lot of things. CNN: So everybody wants to know, the guy behind ""Bust Your Windows"" -- is there one? Sullivan: We won't talk about that on camera -- that's an off-camera conversation -- but it's definitely a song that relates to a lot of women especially. You know, even if they really haven't busted windows out of anybody's car, they have wanted to. A lot of women have been through that, so I'm glad that my music is touching those people . CNN: ""Need U Bad"" is rising as well. What's the thought process behind that one? Sullivan: ""Need U Bad"" ... a lot of men actually pointed out to me that women don't come out and admit that they made mistakes and say that they actually need the male, so I think that was kind of cool. I haven't thought of it like that when I was writing it. So, you know, it's a song for the fellas, saying that we appreciate them and we need you as much as you need us. But on the flip side, I do a song like ""Bust Your Windows,"" so on the album you have a lot of different perceptions and everything. CNN: How old are you? You look like you're 10. Sullivan: I'm 21 years old. CNN: Success that early, that's sometimes tough for people. Sullivan: Well, I've been in this industry for a very long time. I started out when I was 12; I got signed when I was 16, so it wasn't an overnight success story at all. I put a lot of hard work into it, and this is just a byproduct of all of that. CNN: It's great that you write your own music too, because a lot of people don't do that. You have a lot more creative control. Sullivan: Most definitely, and I've dealt with not having that control when I was younger and I was signed. I wasn't writing at all, and so I've been through all of that. So now to be in a position where I write my music, and I have that control -- it feels so much better. CNN: All right, the big question: Grammy night. What are you wearing? Who are you bringing? What are you going to be doing? Sullivan: I'm bringing my mother. She's been my rock and my support ever since I was a baby. She was my first huge fan, that what she is. I don't know what I'm wearing. I'm trying not to think about that. I want to perform. Hopefully I can get on stage and I can show everybody who I am and what I'm about. But I haven't thought about the dress or the shoes or the hair or anything about that. CNN: You're just trying to enjoy the moment. Sullivan: Enjoy, yes.",0.8014424,2896
10,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- What started as a college a cappella pastime became a ticket to the big time for 10 Indiana University graduates. Straight No Chaser broke up years ago, but success on YouTube brought the band back together. Last year a member of the disbanded group -- called Straight No Chaser -- posted a video of a quirky 1998 performance of ""The 12 Days of Christmas"" on YouTube. It got more than 8 million hits. And one of the people watching was Craig Kallman, chairman and CEO of Atlantic Records. Kallman summoned a couple of the troupe members to Los Angeles, where he offered them a record deal. Straight up. The boys (now men, of course) got back together and within 10 months -- and almost 10 years after graduation -- had a debut album neatly tied with a bow. And you thought your college reunion was exciting.  Watch Straight No Chaser blend their voices » . ""Holiday Spirits"" mostly features festive covers such as ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" and ""Silent Night,"" all sung in the a cappella tradition but with creative and entertaining tweaks. (They do a stirring Christmas-infused rendition of Toto's ""Africa."") Members of Straight No Chaser sang for CNN in New York recently, talked about their surprising career turn and where it leaves their day jobs. CNN: What is it like then to actually become a YouTube sensation? Randy Stine: Well, [Jerome] got recognized on the street in Hong Kong. Jerome Collins: A person walked up to me and said, ""Hey, I know this may be out of line, but you look like this guy on this video I just saw."" I called [Randy] and I was like, ""We officially made it. We're being recognized in Hong Kong by some random person on the street."" So it was kind of cool, and that's when I knew that [it] was on a bigger scale than we thought. CNN: What went through your mind when you got the call from Atlantic Records? Stine: I was half believing it was a prank. I got the call from Craig, and while I'm talking to him the first time, I'm on the computer Googling his name to read his bio. It was just kind of a dream phone call. And I kept thinking, ""Is this really happening?"" It was pretty amazing. CNN: You all have day jobs, don't you? Stine: Yeah. I was actually in Chicago doing IT sales, wishing I was still in music. We're all spread across the country. We've got guys in Chicago, Vegas, Atlanta, here in New York. Jerome was actually in Hong Kong when all this started, and he moved back from Hong Kong to be a part of this. CNN: What were you doing in Hong Kong? Collins: I was doing a festival of ""The Lion King,"" and I was Simba. We have one guy selling medical devices, another guy a reporter for ABC, one guy working at a bank, another guy a teacher. ... You name it, we have it. CNN: And how do you arrange rehearsing or performances if you are scattered throughout the country? Stine: That's probably one of the big challenges. We all have to fly in from whatever city we're in to New York, to Chicago, L.A., wherever we have to meet up to rehearse or record. But when we get together it's like no time has passed. CNN: Are you going to keep your day jobs? Collins: There's no chance that I'm going to be keeping my day job. I obviously gave it up to try and do this so I know for a fact that I'm not going to be going back. I hope they didn't hear that. This is it. This is what I dreamed to do as a kid. This is what I want my day job to be. Stine: I quit my job in July. I had to get enough time off to record but couldn't do it. I have one shot at this. I know there are tons of other musicians out there who would cut off a limb to have this opportunity so I couldn't pass it up. Collins: We're going to force the other guys to make sure they quit their jobs. With the scheduling and the touring some of them may not have a job to go back to. So that's what we're hoping may happen. CNN: That's what you're hoping? You're hoping that they will get fired? That's nice! Stine: Yeah, we'll make the phone calls on their behalf. Like, ""he's not coming into work today"" [Stine and Collins laugh.] . CNN: Now that you have your debut album in the can, are you thinking ahead to other projects? Collins: Well, that's the whole point. We hope that that momentum -- not only with YouTube, but with our album -- keeps going so we can get right back in the studio and come out with some fresh new music that's not holiday. We don't want to pigeonhole ourselves. We do all genres, all types of music. CNN: Part of your appeal seems to be that you don't really take yourselves too seriously, do you? You have a lot of fun with it. Collins: It's really fun singing with your best friends onstage. We have fun. Outside of this business, we are still friends; we all go do things together; we all still hang out. We still fight like brothers. So essentially ... I hope that never changes because that's what made us who we are today. CNN: What about your personalities ... have you all changed a little since you were at school together? Stine: I think all of us are pretty much the same, just maybe more opinionated. Collins: Some of us have wives. That's the only thing that's changed. CNN: Why are you called Straight No Chaser? Stine: We basically came up with the name from Thelonious Monk, his jazz album and song. And we just thought it really tied in well to our mentality of voices, no instruments. And of course it ties in to college and visiting the bars late at night.",0.8008398,9545
11,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Chester French is giving its music away. Chester French, Max Drummey, left, and D.A. Wallach are earning buzz as a band to watch. Go to the duo's Web site and you can scoop up an entirely free ""athletic-themed"" album. The idea is that you'll be so impressed by the free stuff, you'll feel inspired to buy the band's official debut album, ""Love The Future"" (Star Trak/Interscope), which came out last month. ""We're doing something that's never been done by a band before,"" says lead singer D.A. Wallach. ""It's great because when you put out free music, people can spread it around as much as they want. And right now as we're just trying to expose ourselves to more people. Every new supporter helps."" The band has even come up with a fancy name for its fans: ""VIP Concierge Service."" So who are these two clever, skinny dudes who jokingly claim to ""put in a lot of burn at the gym""? Wallach and Max Drummey met at Harvard, but found music to be more interesting than their studies. Fortunately for them, sought-after producer Pharrell Williams liked what he heard and signed the group to his label. So far things seems to be working out for Chester French (named for sculptor Daniel Chester French, though the group is sick of explaining). They won a place on Rolling Stone's ""Artists to Watch"" list in 2008. HBO's ""Entourage"" showed some love for their catchy single ""She Loves Everybody.""  Watch Chester French get punched by a pretty girl » . And then there's the transportation situation. ""Right now we're on the first tour bus we've ever had,"" says Wallach. ""We were driving around in a van for the past year and a half and it's a real luxury now to be able to sleep while we're driving."" The band spoke to CNN about the challenges of navigating a rapidly changing industry, getting punched by a pretty girl in a music video and why the Beach Boys have nothing on them. CNN: How does it feel to be called the next big thing? D.A. Wallach: You know what, we actually haven't been called that in those words too often. But if we did, that would be very flattering. CNN: Things get a bit violent in the music video for your song ""She Loves Everybody."" Who's idea was it to have you both get beaten up by an angry girl? Wallach: It was the director's. We worked with Paul Hunter on the video and it was our first music video. ... He had the concept that love hurts. So this girl was going to take it out on us and we were going to be all about it and still smiling and enjoying it. CNN: So it was a lot of fun? Wallach: Yeah it was great. It was painless. Actually we both got hit accidentally by her. I mean most of the hits were kind of staged punches. But we both got hit once each, and it was fun. CNN: You're both Harvard graduates. Does that make you the smartest dudes in pop music? Wallach: Probably not. We were kind of nerds in high school. And the hardest part about Harvard is getting in, people say. After that you take it at your own pace. And at different times we were more or less engaged there, but we met some other really intelligent, thoughtful people. Max Drummey: And there's definitely a lot of stupid people at Harvard. CNN: Tell me how you both met. Wallach: We met in the dining hall our freshman year and we started the band with three of our classmates. It was just a funny hobby at first and it wasn't until sophomore year that we really got serious about it and said, ""OK, let's actually try and make this a possibility as a career."" CNN: And didn't you record most of your new album on campus? Wallach: Yeah, there was a recording studio in the basement of one of the dorms at Harvard and we were both recording engineers there. So we recorded lots for other people as well. And in our free time we were working on the record we just released, ""Love the Future."" CNN: Is it true that there was a bit of a bidding war between Jermaine Dupri and Pharrell Williams (over the record deal)? Wallach: No. ... There were several people all at once who were interested in working with us and it was a little awkward because they're all friends with each other. And since we've been working with Pharrell we've stayed cool with everyone. ... We couldn't have gone wrong. CNN: Why do you think there's been all this interest from hip-hop producers? Drummey: We're the hottest rappers out. Wallach: I'm from Milwaukee, he's from Boston. They're both very diverse cities and we grew up with friends and all different kinds of music around us. So the records we make are inspired by a lot of different places. And certainly having grown up in the '90s, hip-hop is a part of the soundtrack for us and so it's very natural for us to have learned things from Dr. Dre or Pharrell and people like that. CNN: A lot of people compare your sound to the Beach Boys. How do you feel about that comparison? Drummey: I mean we're definitely better. And we came first too. So it's sort of a ridiculous comparison. CNN: Don't you play the theremin? Drummey: Yeah. Not well. Wallach: There are only a couple of people who play it at a virtuoso level. You'd have to really have something off to put the time in as a theremin artist. CNN: What has been the most surprising aspect of the music business so far? Wallach: I think the biggest surprise has been that people don't really know a hundred percent what they're doing. Everyone is trying to figure out how the music business is going to look in 10 years. And as a new artist there's not a blueprint. I figured you'd get signed and you're instantly on billboards. And the reality of it is that we find ourselves in a situation where all we can focus on is building our audience one person at a time. And it's just a brick-and-mortar, nose-to-the-grindstone process. CNN: What musicians do you admire as being fellow brainiacs? Wallach: Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails I think is really brilliant, not just on a musical level. Pharrell's been incredibly helpful and his advice is always really apt. Jay-Z. Really, when you're in the thick of it, anybody who's built a real career has something figured out. Or they got really lucky.",0.7943199,3779
12,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Chris Cornell has taken to Twitter like Tweety Bird took to making mischief. Chris Cornell's new solo album, ""Scream,"" was produced by Timbaland. He acknowledges it's an odd mix. Not to suggest he's using the popular social networking service to cause trouble. Hardly. The 44-year-old rock musician said he enjoys the open stream of chit-chat with his fans. ""It's actually created an environment where I can answer simple questions that someone's probably had forever,"" said Cornell. ""And I don't mind answering them. And I can actually have conversations with fans that are quick, but still more meaningful than the typical situations you're put into. I've really liked it."" His more than 200,000 followers can revel in bite-size musings about life on the road (""crowd was amazing last night"") or sweet tweets to his wife, Vicky (""hi baby! i miss you!"").  Watch Cornell talk about his Twitter fascination » . The former front man of Soundgarden and Audioslave -- who is also known for singing the James Bond theme ""Casino Royale"" -- is the first to admit he's a fan of experimenting. His new solo album, ""Scream,"" has him meshing his rock vibe with dance-floor beats by the much sought-after producer Timbaland. The collaboration has left some people scratching their heads. Nine Inch Nails lead singer Trent Reznor took a swipe by twittering: ""You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable? Heard Chris Cornell's record?"" Ouch. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart, but it took a substantial tumble the second week. But Cornell -- who said he's never met Reznor nor read or responded to his tweet -- was more than ready for criticism. ""You could kind of see it coming,"" he said. ""Some of it is a script that was written just by putting [me and Timbaland] together. And most of the negative responses fit that script perfectly: 'You can't put these two things together. We don't like it! We're not going to let you! So we're gonna say bad stuff.' "" For Cornell, working with Timbaland required him to ""rinse away everything that I knew about songwriting and recording."" He said the biggest challenge was in having to relearn how to sing to a different rhythm, his raspy voice needing to match up with slick studio beats rather than sliding loosely around the live, loud accompaniment he's so used to. ""To me it seemed like an exciting thing to just go and do,"" he said. ""I think this is as good as any album I've ever made, and I listen to it probably more than any other record I've ever made."" Cornell spoke to CNN about Timbaland, Twitter and throwing stuff out windows. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Some people have said that you've lost your musical identity in this album. Chris Cornell: I don't have one, really. I don't want to have one. If I had a musical identity that was definable then it would be time to get into painting or something else. Race car driving. CNN: So you would be happy to be experimental on your next album? Cornell: Absolutely. CNN: So what was it like working with Timbaland? Cornell: He didn't really have a particular direction in mind in terms of what he wanted me to do. He did what Timbaland does, and I did what I do. We just wrote songs, which is really the best thing that came out of it. ... It doesn't sound like anybody else's record. It doesn't sound like music I've ever heard. It defies genre, and yet it's very much a song-oriented album as well as an album-oriented album. ... The music never stops. I've performed it that way. It's almost like a movie soundtrack. CNN: How often do you Twitter? Cornell: It depends. When I'm out on the road, depending on the day, a couple times a day I'll spend a half-hour or an hour or so. I've found that doing vocal warm-ups and Twitter at the same time, cause I'm a multitasker. I can watch CNN -- because I do -- and then I can be online and do vocal warm-ups all at the same time. And only one of those things is way too boring. CNN: I read a couple of your tweets, and you said that you were having trouble sleeping. Is that an occupational hazard? Cornell: Probably, yeah. I think everybody has a hard time when you play ... [a] show and then you're finished at 1:30 in the morning. It takes me an hour and a half to be able to eat after that and then to be able to sleep after that. It's hard. CNN: What is the biggest misconception about being a rock musician? Cornell: My first answer would be that it's just all a big party. But then I've been in that situation or seen bands like that where it is all a big party. I think overall there's this idea that it isn't work, that it isn't something that you have to put pretty much 100 percent of your focus and your being into, that it's like winning the lottery in a sense. And I think if you're a musician that's had any kind of success there is a component to that. There's some aspect to timing and luck, there's talent obviously as well. But it's a lot of traveling. It's a lot of waiting, it's a lot of leaving one city going into another city only to see the venue you're going to play in when you arrive, playing for the audience and then leaving and going to the next city. CNN: Have you ever thrown a really big object through a window? Cornell: Yeah. I threw an amplifier, a small one, through a window only because me and a few friends of mine that were out on tour together just made the observation [that] our generation just doesn't do stuff like that. So we sort of did it as kind of a ritualistic, ""OK, let's participate in the real thing."" There was a piece of duct tape on the amplifier that had my name on it. So I had to run down to the alley and take that tape off so that they wouldn't know who threw it off to the street.",0.79094934,2922
13,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The day I interviewed Neil Diamond, he was sitting in a little room to the side of a studio, and a makeup artist was smacking him in the face with a powder puff. He was wearing a white wife-beater T-shirt and looked like he wanted to flee. Neil Diamond is riding high with a huge world tour, a successful album and a humanitarian award. It was November, and Diamond had just come off the first two legs of his biggest world tour yet -- with 64 shows in 50 cities and nine countries already under his belt. In a moment, he would step in front of a camera to begin a round of 70 or so interviews -- beamed via satellite to local television stations -- to talk up the remaining 20 dates, where he'd thrill diehard fans with such nuggets as ""Cherry Cherry,"" ""Song Sung Blue"" and ""Sweet Caroline."" Ours was the only in-person interview he -- or someone in his camp -- had agreed to do. The singer-songwriter (who turned 68 on January 24) stepped into the studio, a man ready for his close-up. He had slipped a black button-down shirt over his T-shirt, and suddenly he looked like Neil Diamond -- the same Neil Diamond who next week will be feted by The Recording Academy as its ""2009 MusiCares Person of the Year,"" joining an elite club that includes Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Sting, Bono and Quincy Jones. He's working on a follow-up to last year's CD, the Rick Rubin-produced ""Home Before Dark"" -- which earned Diamond his first-ever No. 1 debut on the Billboard Top 200 album chart. That album came after 2005's ""12 Songs,"" also produced by Rubin, which re-invigorated his recording career. As for live performance, he's rarely had problems filling arenas -- but he remembers when he did.  Watch Diamond talk about giving back » . CNN: The man in black. This has become quite the trademark. Neil Diamond: Yeah. I still wear black, but I got sparkly somewhere along the way -- especially if you are playing in an 18,000-seat arena, you like to be seen by somebody in the back. CNN: I've been to a Neil Diamond concert, and everybody stands up, and they sing every word to every song. Don't you ever want to tell them, ""I'm singing -- listen!"" Diamond: No, I don't -- but I did in the very beginning when I first realized on my first few records that people were singing along. I thought, ""You shouldn't be singing. That's my job. Let me sing and you listen."" But then I realized that it's a compliment. They knew the music, they loved it and they wanted to sing. So I said, ""All right, let's sing together."" [chuckles] . CNN: Whenever you hit the road, you're one of the year's top ticket draws and play to more than a million fans per tour. [Diamond had the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2008, taking in $60 million in ticket sales.] . Diamond: It's truly not until the last leg that you finally get the show down. You are relaxed with it, you are not worried about the intricacies of the show, and the last shows are always the best and the most fun. CNN: After 40 years in the business, do you still get nervous? Diamond: I don't know if it's nerves. I get excited. I want things to go right. I want the audience to love the show. CNN: For this tour, you've donated all the proceeds from merchandise sales [T-shirts, programs and other souvenir items] to the victims of Hurricane Ike in Texas. We're talking about a figure that's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars. Diamond: Hurricane Ike hit southern Texas so fiercely [in September 2008, while Diamond was on tour], and has been forgotten about by the rest of the country -- but these people are still in desperate straits, and are in dire need of our help. And I saw what was going on. The mayor of Houston took me around, and he told me about it and introduced me to some people. The next day, I drove down to some of the hardest-hit areas, and I just felt that I had to do something, and I felt that maybe my audience would help me out with it. So we just say the merchandise and whatever you buy goes down to those people to rebuild their homes. They are still living in tents and cars down there. So to all the people down in Oak Island, Galveston, Galveston Bay and Houston, help is on the way -- and that's the message that I want to bring and spread around. The Eagles just made a substantial donation to this fund. CNN: Has that inspired new songwriting for you? Diamond: I don't know if it has inspired new songwriting -- I don't do a lot of writing when I am out touring -- but it has inspired a reality in me of what's going on. You tend to live in a bubble when you are traveling and touring. I missed the election completely. I actually worked and performed election night. The wonderful people of Green Bay, Wisconsin, came and filled the place, and I said to them, ""I appreciate you coming down, because there is something really good on television."" I missed the election completely. I got off the stage and tuned into the concession speech. But I heard it was very dramatic, and I'm happy with the outcome. You tend to miss things when you're on the road. CNN: Right before the Grammys, you're being honored by The Recording Academy as its ""2009 MusiCares Person of the Year."" Diamond: Well, it's a wonderful honor any time the Grammys extend an honor to you. [Diamond has received 12 nominations over his career, but has only won one award.] But the real satisfaction I get from that benefit -- that big dinner -- is that the money will be going to musicians who are facing very difficult times. It's not the most secure job in the world, and there are musicians who are facing medical emergencies and financial difficulties who will benefit from the money that is being generated. It's a cause that's very close to my heart. I have been very fortunate, and I have been successful. CNN: When you tour, you sell out 20,000-seat arenas -- but do you ever worry about a day when you might walk out on stage and there are only two or three people in the audience? Diamond: Well, that did happen to me very early in my career. So yeah, that has occurred to me. I'm always a little amazed that people show up, and I don't know where they came from -- but I'm thrilled that they are there. CNN: Do you ever wonder what you would have done had this all not worked out? Diamond: I do, and I don't like any of the choices that I would have made, or any of the places that I would have been. CNN: I hear you earned a fencing scholarship to NYU. Diamond: Yeah, I did. But you can't make a living as a fencer these days. CNN: So this is definitely much better. Diamond: Yes, this is a lot better. I love singing. I have been singing since I was a little boy, so to make a life in music as a writer and as a singer -- I think I have the best job in the world. CNN: At the end of the tour, you're only taking two days off, and then you begin working on your next album. Don't you believe in vacations? Diamond: I'm not the kind of guy that's good at laying on the beach for too long. If I'm laying on the beach, it's with a guitar and a legal pad, and I'm thinking about music.",0.79014635,2856
14,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Joan Baez is in a celebratory mood. And rightly so: She's survived 50 years in show business. Joan Baez says that her new Steve Earle-produced album was meant to sound like a throwback to the folk era. The legendary singer, who rose to fame during the folk movement of the 1950s and 1960s, is marking the occasion with a new album called ""Day After Tomorrow."" Produced by Steve Earle (whom Baez likes to call ""Mister Gruff""), it's a collection of bluegrass-tinged songs reminiscent of her early repertoire. ""We were looking for songs that feel like now but sound like back then,"" she said. Earle penned one of the album's standout tracks, ""God Is God,"" which he describes as ""recovery speak."" Baez also covers ""Scarlet Tide,"" a song written by Elvis Costello and T Bone Burnett for the 2003 film ""Cold Mountain."" At 67, Baez finds her voice may not have the sheer power it did in her 20s, but her political spirit is intact. She passionately expressed her support for Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the first time the self-described pacifist has taken sides in party politics. ""I haven't heard an orator like that since King,"" she said. Baez knew the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and famously sang the protest song ""We Shall Overcome"" to a massive crowd at the Lincoln Memorial during King's 1963 March on Washington. Baez spoke to CNN about sustaining her voice and finding happiness in her 60s. The following is an edited version of that interview, which was conducted before Tuesday's election. CNN: What did Steve Earle bring to the table with your new album? Joan Baez: Oh, everything but the voice. Spirit, some songs. His gruffness to my non-gruffness. He worked fast, really fast, and I like that. And he brought the musicians. I don't know who to choose for musicians. We were a good match. CNN: Is there a song on the album that speaks to you more than others? Baez: I guess the ones I go back listening to are ""God Is God"" and ""Rose of Sharon."" ""Rose of Sharon"" sounds exactly like an old folk song. I wouldn't have guessed in a million years that it's contemporary. CNN: How does it feel to be embarking on a new tour at such a politically charged time? Baez: I've never seen this country this politically charged. I realized something this morning. I was watching Obama on TV and I thought, ""I really love this guy."" I love what he's capable of, I love that he's genuine. He's a statesman, and he's brilliant. People say do you think he can change America? He already has. ... And I know most of the things he'll have to do I would battle him to the death. He's going to be commander in chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and I'm a pacifist [laughs]. CNN: So you would almost prefer that he didn't run for president, that his talents could be applied in other ways? Baez: Yeah. I've thought that, yeah. Part of me wishes very strongly that Obama would be outside the system and his hands would be less tied. CNN: In the '50s and '60s, you lived and breathed the causes you rallied behind.  When you look at young musicians today, do you feel they're attaching themselves to charities or causes because it's hip, rather than meaningful? Baez: I think it's probably a combination of things. I think people are afraid of risk so they'll [only] go so far. But I don't think people have felt the urgency that we felt in the '60s. But it's there. The urgency is there. There's a need for community, but we don't feel it. CNN: Why is that? Baez: That we don't feel it? Because we live more and more separately. Kids are walking down the street plugged in [to personal electronics]. The only place there's community really is in the ghetto, where they need each other and they know it. We need each other, and we don't know it. CNN: You look back at all the causes you've rallied behind, and there have been so many. ... Baez: It makes me dizzy. CNN: [Do] you feel emotionally wrung out? Baez: No. It's the opposite. What happens is it starts generating energy for myself. There's some part of me that's wiped out. I feel that sometimes. CNN: Do you find you have to work harder to keep your voice in shape? Baez: Oh God, yeah. It was very humiliating to find out that I was like everybody else in the world and that I had to get coaching. And now it's a real issue. I have to do [vocal exercises] every day, especially on tour. It's pretty exhausting. CNN: Would you say that life in your 60s is easier than life in your 20s and 30s? Baez: Oh God, yes. ... I was a highly neurotic kid, not particularly happy, which probably accounts for all those beautiful songs, those beautiful sad ballads. I found my home there. And as the years went by and as the therapy went on I was holding together. And then at around 50, I decided to fall apart and find the pieces and put them back where they should've been. And I did. And I did what I thought was impossible, which was really drag the stuff up, look at it, go through all that and then each time I did that ... it became a daily thing with the therapist ... to find out something huge. Go through the terror, go through all of it and then by the end of the week something had changed a little bit. This went on for a number of years. So I am now in a stage nothing like where I was before then. There's no stage fright now. Just the joy of singing. CNN: You're happy being single, aren't you? Baez: Yeah. After all I've been through, I don't want to risk [pats her heart]. I mean I feel so extraordinary, so much better. And you know if something walked into my life that feels right ... the question is, am I ready to see it or not? I'm sure it's wandered by me a few times. But at some point maybe I'll be ready to see that in which case it would be a good thing. ... [In] Buddhism there's no real happiness without the struggle. But the struggle has to defeat you in a way [before] you get to be like the Dalai Lama. You know those monks all giggle? All the time! They've got it figured out. Because things are what they are on Earth, and you be as good as you can, and you die, it's the next life. So what's the big f****** deal?",0.7852429,7873
15,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Barely six months after being crowned the winner of ""American Idol,"" David Cook has released his self-titled debut album. David Cook recently released his debut album, which includes songs about his family. The Missouri native (no relation to the author of this article) described the recording process as ""squeezing a year's worth of work on a record into 2½ months."" But he's very happy with the result. ""It's a very accurate definition of where I'm at, where I was and where I want to be,"" he said. Cook sticks to his rock roots on the release, eliciting help from ex-Soundgarden member Chris Cornell to write the lead single, ""Light On."" He also keeps loved ones close: The track ""Heroes"" is a tribute to his family. ""Permanent"" (which Cook describes as having a ""delicate and lullaby feel"") and ""A Daily AntheM"" (""sing-alongy and grandiose"") acknowledge his older brother, who is battling brain cancer. The latter song was written three years before Cook's ""Idol"" run, when he was cutting his teeth as a grass-roots rocker.  Watch David Cook show his chops » . Cook, 25, dropped by CNN's New York offices (with his mother, Beth Foraker, in tow) to talk about keeping creative control, losing his privacy and his responsibility as Idol No. 7. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: You were very involved in the making of your debut album, weren't you? David Cook: Yeah. Out of 12 songs on the record, I wrote or co-wrote 10, and the label was even kind enough to let me get involved with the art direction on the record. So it was a busy summer. CNN: You actually have a degree in graphic design, don't you? Cook: I spent five long years at the University of Central Missouri. It should've been four, but I enjoyed college a little bit more than I should have. CNN: There's skepticism that American Idols have very little control over the music they ultimately make. That wasn't the case for you? Cook: Well, I can't speak for anybody else except myself, and I guess in that sense, I lucked out. I mean, 19 [Entertainment] and RCA really [gave] me a little bit of carte blanche to allow me to make a record that is me. And to that end, I think we managed to pull something really cool off. CNN: What was your approach with the music? Cook: I tried to put music down on this record that [translated] live. I want these songs to make people feel things and invoke certain responses in an audience. And so it's a lot of very epic choruses and open bridges and stuff like that. Something that will give a show some room to meander and feel like a unique experience for everybody. CNN: [Lead single ""Light On""] debuted on the Billboard charts at No. 17, and then several weeks later -- about four -- it dropped to No. 80. Was that discouraging? Cook: No, not really. I think, for us, it's all about the long-term results. And I feel like the song seems to be getting speed now, especially with the record coming out. It just feels like everything's headed in the right direction, so I'm definitely not one to hang my head on immediate results. I'd rather the song hit No. 1 four months from now if it's gonna do it. I'm just excited to get this record out. I'm excited to have people hear it. CNN: When you were catapulted to fame, did you ever experience any self-doubt or feelings of insecurity? Cook: I'll be the first to admit there are [musicians] out there who are way better than me. I feel almost a responsibility to do everything that I can with this on their behalf as well as my own. But I've always been a confident person. I feel like I know why I'm here, I know what put me here. It's just a matter of trusting it and going with it. CNN: All this talk about you and [""American Idol"" runner-up] David Archuleta being mortal enemies is absolute garbage, isn't it? Cook: It is. David is one of the most unassuming, down-to-earth people I think I've ever met. It seems like he has no idea he was even on the show, let alone did well. And I find that really endearing. He'll be the first to congratulate you. He seems to just appreciate every moment . CNN: You seem to be a very private person. Has all this attention been a little intrusive? Cook: In a sense, yeah. It's a little strange to go from toiling in obscurity to having to worry about walking out of a restaurant and [seeing] who's going to shove a camera in your face and all that. But it comes with the territory, and if dealing with that on occasion allows me to make music that I want to make ... then, I'll take it.",0.77804285,4985
16,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. Once upon a time, the iconic lead singer of Led Zeppelin and the golden girl of bluegrass would never have been mentioned in the same sentence. Alison Krauss and Robert Plant's ""Raising Sand"" was an unlikely collaboration that won five Grammys. But since they won five Grammy awards -- including album of the year for their surprising collaboration, ""Raising Sand"" -- their names have been inextricably linked: RobertPlantandAlisonKrauss. If they were 20 years old and ran in Hollywood circles, tabloids might be calling them Robekrauss or Aliplant. Plant, however, is 60 -- in fantastic shape, and with a full head of the golden ringlets that became his trademark during the 1970s. At 37, Krauss is elegant and ethereal. And while both are dead serious when talking about their craft, the rest of the time, they're like two silly junior high kids -- he, the charming prankster with a secret crush, and she, the beautiful prom queen who pretends not to be amused. Clearly, they're both having the time of their lives, and are excited about their current musical journey -- which pushes each out of their respective comfort zones and into new territory. Now, he's a little bit country and she's a little bit rock 'n' roll.  Watch Plant and Krauss rib each other » . I compliment Krauss on her hair as a stylist touches her up. ""It's not mine,"" she whispers. Two feet away, Plant clears his throat loudly and points to his own golden locks. ""Why, your hair looks lovely, too, Robert,"" I say. ""Well, you know who I am,"" he replies. We are in Coldplay's vacated dressing room, two nights before Plant and Krauss swept the evening at the 51st annual Grammy Awards. This is an excerpt from our conversation in the basement of Staples Center in Los Angeles the night of their rehearsal. CNN: First of all, this is the screwiest collaboration I had ever heard of. How did this happen? Robert Plant: It's just sheer luck, really. I never sang with anybody before, you know -- only once ever in my life, on ""Led Zep IV"" with Sandy Denny [the late English folk singer, in 1971]. So this is a whole new thing. I've also been coming to the United States for 40 years -- you wouldn't believe it looking at me -- and I've never worked with Americans! This is all brand new for me. Alison Krauss: Were we both nervous? We both were. We thought, ""What are we going to do in there?"" We went into the studio originally saying, ""We'll give it three days and see what it's like."" Plant: Alison's reputation is 24 karat, and I'm an old rock 'n' roll singer. Even the band was kind of going, ""Oh wow, how is this going to work?"" It was great when we kicked in together, and I could just feel the room -- I don't want to say it, but the room lifted! CNN: Musically, you're polar opposites. How did you blend your different perspectives? Plant: As we got started, it was Alison's world. She knew how she wanted to proceed, and we exchanged a lot of ideas musically. And then we both agreed that because we both produced records ourselves, that we needed an intermediary to guide -- somebody to separate us, or to make the journey more clear. And Alison knew T Bone Burnett from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" and he kindly enlisted for the gig, and he brought a lot of great songs to the show. CNN: You challenged one another to sing in different ways than you're used to. Plant: When she goes up for these wailing notes on stage, that's where I want her to go with this new project -- occasionally visit these places where she lets rip, and just lets it really come out. Krauss (melodramatically): It's just reckless abandon! It's just crazy! Plant: I don't know why I'm being so serious. She just kicks ass and nobody knew it! CNN: Now this is all making sense. With Alison, it's letting go, and with you, Robert, it's kind of containing things. Plant: I'm being bullied, basically. Pushed around. CNN: But you like it. Admit it, you love it. Plant: Oh, I do! I haven't even gotten off to being bullied enough yet. CNN: Did you have this much fun working with Zeppelin? Plant: I can't remember. Honestly, I haven't got a clue. I was a totally different guy then. It was 28 years ago. I didn't look as good as I do now, and I didn't share the couch with another Leo. CNN: Alison, did you listen to Led Zeppelin growing up? Krauss: We all have, yeah. (Plant is shaking his head and mouthing the word ""No."") My brother was and is such a huge fan of the band, and I remember growing up and he would be in his bedroom yelling about the records and how great they were. CNN: Robert, were you familiar with Alison's work? Plant: Yeah, to some degree, but not as intensely as I became. And also, I didn't understand the history of where Alison's from [bluegrass], and has been since she was a child. In fact, both of us can sit there talking about music, and neither of us can recognize the artists we're referring to. It's amazing. I mean, all the rock 'n' roll, and black Mississippi and Chicago stuff that I go raving on about, she's going, ""Hmm."" Krauss: I didn't grow up on that, yeah. CNN: Has he made you listen to his music collection? Plant: We share. Krauss: I bring bluegrass. It's the same people. Same blue-collar people. Just one was south of the Delta, and one was Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina. So we've got lots in common -- but it's the presentation and the whole musicality of it that's different. CNN: Your collaboration has worked out so well that you're back in the studio in Nashville, working on a second album together. Plant: We'd like to keep it going. CNN: Do you think there's going to be an album No. 3, and an album No. 4? Plant: I'd have to move to Nashville, wouldn't I? CNN: Or she moves to England. Plant (to Krauss): Could you stand the climate? Krauss: I'll get a heating pad. Plant: And a season ticket for Wolverhampton Wanderers football club. That's important. CNN: You gained a lot of fans with this project, but there are those Led Zeppelin diehards who've been holding their breath for a reunion tour -- especially since you reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert at Wembley in 2007. Plant: Well, we had a really good night, and we had great rehearsals, and it was very emotional -- and if you like, quite elevating. But it was the right thing to do to do it that way. There's no bandwagon. We've already been around the world, and did what we did when we were young men. CNN: That sounds like a man who's looking forward, and not back. Plant: Only last week, I was being grilled again by Alison to get into shape and get it right. And that's fantastic! I really want that. I don't want to go around, everybody thinking, ""That's what he did."" Because this is what I do, and every day, it should be more interesting. CNN: And in the meantime, you've been recognized by the Grammys. Plant: We've already won by doing this. We've brought our gifts, and we've shared them, and the whole surrounding musically is so beautiful, that that's our reward. The fact that it worked. The fact that it wasn't some embarrassing moment of two people trying something out, and saying goodbye, and then meeting at a party years later and saying, ""Oh, Christ, there's Alison Krauss! Oh, no!""",0.77771235,2272
17,"(CNN) -- The Indigo Girls navigate the challenges of today's recording environment with their new two-disc album, ""Poseidon and the Bitter Bug."" The Indigo Girls, Amy Ray, left, and Emily Saliers released their latest folk-rock album on Tuesday. Rather than abandon ship amid the country's economic recession and after being dumped by their former label, the folk-rockers decided to release the album independently -- and they recorded it in a mere three weeks. The veteran Atlanta, Georgia, duo remains optimistic about America's recording industry and the ability of artists to market themselves online. But nothing will replace a heartfelt live performance, said Amy Ray. ""We need to keep art as a visceral experience, too, and not just an Internet experience,"" said Ray, who plays in the group with Emily Saliers. It is ""going to be up to bands to keep touring and people to keep going to hear 'em.""  Watch their live performance and interview with CNN » . CNN talked with the Indigo Girls about the Internet, food, their Southern roots and their newest album's strange name. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: What's been the primary influence for you all? Has it been a place, like Atlanta? Or has it been something else? Emily Saliers: Atlanta and the South, just in general. ... Some of it comes through the content and some of it just comes through a vibe. We're sort of a hootenanny bar band. We cut our teeth in Little Five Points Pub, and what we always like to do is bring people up on the stage and jam with us. ... We tie it back to the days when people just sat on the porch and played together. It's a very Southern thing, an Appalachian thing. CNN: Tell me about the title for this album. Saliers: Mitchell Froom, the producer, came up with the title, and it was originally a joke. He said it and he laughed -- and we all laughed. Naming a record is probably one of the hardest things in the whole process, and that name just stuck with us. And it's also cool because ""Poseidon"" is a reference to a lyric in one of my songs, and ""Bitter Bug"" is a reference to a lyric in one of Amy's songs. So to be able to fit two of those pieces together in a way that works is cool. CNN: And you all are working as free agents on this [album]. Tell me about that. Amy Ray: We got dropped from the last label we were on, Hollywood, right before we were going to go into the studio, so we just kind of kept all of our plans in place and everyone that was going to be involved with us came to the table and gave us deals and made it work. ... Creatively we've always done what we want, but on the business level it's demoralizing when you feel like there's not a team anymore because the label you're on isn't really behind you or doesn't know what to do, or is kind of paralyzed by the industry, generally. CNN: What are you all listening to lately? Saliers: You know, I just bought yesterday -- I downloaded it -- Sean Lennon's last record. I saw him on some obscure Japanese channel when we were in some other part of the world and I really like the sound of that. And then this artist named Sia. She sang with Zero 7 and she's a really good artist, I like her stuff a lot. I like the Weepies. CNN: You [Emily Saliers] are a part owner in a restaurant here in Atlanta. ... Is there any kind of relationship between music and a good restaurant experience? Saliers: There definitely is! The name of the restaurant is Watershed, it's in Decatur [Georgia]. We're very fortunate to have Scott Peacock as our executive chef. ... He's a very decorated chef but he also makes Southern food -- good Southern food. It's kind of like what your grandmother would make if you grew up in the South: lots of lard and butter and comfort food ... I think the experience of sharing food is a lot like the experience of sharing music. It's just something that people's work goes into it and a lot of love goes into it, and then you share it together. CNN: I wonder what you make of Twitter and artists playing on Second Life and sort of all of these virtual personas that people have these days. Ray: I don't really have a judgment about it one way or the other. I have a lot of friends that delve into all that stuff and it doesn't stop them from being creative in other ways. I think it increases creativity and exercises a different part of your mind. ... My nieces and nephews, they're very involved in [the video game] ""Rock Band"" and stuff like that, which I think is really great because it's introducing them to music, but I just want them to go outside sometime, too. (laughs) That's all. Play in the woods a little bit. CNN: How has your collaboration changed over time? Saliers: The way that we collaborate hasn't changed that much. Amy writes her songs; I write my songs. We write totally separately but then since the very beginning we've come together to arrange songs. ... Over the years we've picked up a few more instruments, so texturally we're more expansive than we were when we were just two guitars at the very beginning. Now there's harmonica and mandolin and banjo -- a little bit of keyboard. We mix that up, but the process is pretty much the same. We just trust it more now.",0.77758074,3495
18,"(NEW YORK) -- Lionel Richie turns 60 this month and he can't believe it either. Singer Lionel Richie says his latest album is some of his best work. In fact, the singer -- who in the '80s found international fame with hits like ""Hello"" and ""All Night Long"" -- is upbeat. Life for him these days couldn't be sweeter, he said. Richie recently released the album ""Just Go"" on which he worked with several acclaimed producers and writers, including Stargate, Tricky Stewart & The Dream and Akon. The multi-Grammy winner and former lead singer of The Commodores said he thinks the album could be his best since 1986's hit, ""Dancing on the Ceiling."" ""That's a very heavy statement,"" he said. ""I love when I get nervous. When I really get nervous -- and I'm nervous about this record -- it means that it's beyond what I thought it was going to be."" Having just completed a European tour, Richie said a North American jaunt is on the drawing board in the next year. ""We are going to tour ... in fine fashion,"" he said. ""We're going to give them everything they ever wanted."" Richie spoke to CNN about avoiding rap, keeping up with the club scene and what gives him chills. CNN: You've always been very diligent about updating your sound. So how do you describe Lionel Richie's sound in 2009? Lionel Richie: It's all in production. You have to first of all feel it. I have to feel it. If I don't feel it, then forget the song. I'm a storyteller, not so much a singer, but a storyteller. So when it comes down to production, we just updated the production. But Akon and Ne-Yo and all these guys ... what do we all have in common? Melody. As long as they don't rap and ask me to rap we have show business. CNN: Have you ever rapped before? Richie: I rapped a couple of times. And it was clear to me, it was told to me from some of the greatest rappers in the world, ""Don't even think about it."" Flavor Flav ... years ago I went to him and I said ""You know I'm thinking about doing some rap on my album. What do you think?"" And he said ""Are you out of your mind?"" He said, ""The only reason I'm rapping is because I can't sing."" And that's the clear channel of where I need to be going. CNN: Right. Just do what you're good at. Richie: Do what I do and don't get away from it. CNN: How much time do you spend doing research in nightclubs? Richie: Now try to explain that to your girlfriend or to your wife! Where are you tonight? I'm doing research! As much time as I can. You have to be in it to see what people are moving to and what turns them on. It's all in beats and rhythms and in lyric content. You can send somebody down to do some study for you. But the bottom line is there's nothing like going in yourself in the middle of a club in London, or in the middle of a club in Australia or a club in the middle of Germany somewhere. Just sit over in the corner and watch what people dance to. By the time I leave France, England, Germany, Italy, America, I can go home and write the most incredible album in the world because I know what the world beat is. I know where everything's going. CNN: You turn 60 very soon. Richie: I cannot believe the number, but yes I do.  Watch Richie say ""hello"" to getting older » . CNN: How do you feel about that? Richie: You know, I don't feel anything except better than anything before. My life is better now than it has ever been ever. So maybe all night long may not be all night long, but it's pretty darn good. CNN: How long are you going to keep churning out records? Richie: I like doing this. I don't like fishing, so this was my hobby when I started. This is how I got into the business when I started because it was a place to go to get away from everything. So I still love doing it. CNN: Looking at all your past hits, what song gives you the most chills to perform? Richie: Wow. That's so tough. [It's] between ""Hello"" and ""Still."" What happens is I look at people in the audience and I kind of know where they are. I know that there's so much depth in their thoughts. Those songs touch the core of whatever it is their lives were about. If there was ever a song about love, or in ""Still,"" something you lost, you could see it in their faces that they're trying to remember every detail of the experience or the person they were with.",0.77074176,5112
19,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Yet another scale Il Divo has mastered: scaling the heights of success. The quartet was formed in 2004 after a global search. The operatic quartet's new album, ""The Promise,"" debuted atop the UK charts, their third collection to hit the No. 1 spot. The album (which was released in the U.S. last Tuesday) features Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""The Power of Love,"" and the traditional ""Amazing Grace."" Il Divo also takes a chance on the ABBA hit ""The Winner Takes it All."" The group is the brainchild of ""American Idol"" judge Simon Cowell, who saw a potential market for an international, ""popera""-style act after the soaring success of the Andrea Bocelli-Sarah Brightman duet ""Time to Say Goodbye (Con te Partiro).""  Watch Il Divo in action » . Formed in 2004 after a global search, Il Divo (Italian for ""divine male performer"") consists of Spanish baritone Carlos Marin, American tenor David Miller, French pop singer Sebastien Izambard, and Swiss tenor Urs Buhler. According to Syco Music, Il Divo's UK-based label, the quartet has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide. It seems Cowell knew what he was doing. CNN caught up with Il Divo to find out how close they are to Cowell, and which American pop diva they dream of collaborating with. CNN: Who do you most get compared to, the Three Tenors or the Backstreet Boys? Carlos Marin: (laughs) It's a mix of everything. I mean at the end [of the day] we are just a pop act. We just sing pop songs, and we just converted mostly the big endings into operatic style. But we are just us, Il Divo. CNN: Are you surprised by how much of a hit you've become? Marin: In a way, yeah. I still remember the first time we went to number one (in the UK). We knocked out Robbie Williams and it was just like ""Wow!"" CNN: What is the big appeal of Il Divo? Urs Buhler: I think it has a lot to do with the big variety we have inside the group, the fact that we are all from four different countries, from different cultural music backgrounds. And we bundle all those different energies ... and bring it together for that one cause -- to make the most beautiful music that we possibly can together. It's not like we have a strategy or recipe for it, it's just that we're passionate about what we do. It works somehow. It's magic. CNN: How involved is [Simon Cowell] with the day-to-day Il Divo operation? Buhler: With the day-to-day operation, I would say his involvement is next to nothing. He's only involved in the actual A&R-ing and the executive producing, which means we meet him about twice a year for an hour. CNN: You took a lot of time off in 2007. In fact you took nearly the whole year off. When you regrouped did you find anything was different? David Miller: Absolutely. The first three years were just a roller coaster of experiences: having the number one in the UK and then that turning into the number one in all the different countries, and going all around the world and being on tour, being on tour with Barbra Streisand and then more albums. Everything kind of bled into everything else and we didn't really have any time to appreciate all the things that we had done. So after this break, [when] we came back together in the studio, it was really like a breath of fresh air. Like the magic of the first album was back. We could appreciate the music again. We could appreciate each other again. And it was a lot more relaxed and a lot more fun. CNN: When you're standing on stage and you look out at the audience what do you see ... is there a certain age range, a certain sex? Miller: It depends on the country we go to. For example, when we go to the UK, it's a slightly more mature audience. When we go to Spain it's a lot younger audience. When we go to South Africa, it's a family affair. So it really just depends, but everywhere we go the universal thing that ties them all in is that they're all music-lovers and they appreciate what we do. CNN: How many languages do you sing in? Buhler: We [sing] in French, Latin, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English ... that would be six. And we speak about seven or eight. CNN: Do you speak the language of love? Marin: Yes, we do! Buhler: That would be the ninth language. CNN: Who is the biggest diva in the group? Marin: We are really four divas. Four captains, one ship. Sebastien Izambard: We have very strong personalities, and we're the producers of our tour and we sit down -- the four of us -- and decide what we're going to do, what set, what choice of the music or lighting. We're four grown-up people and we make that very possible. [In the beginning] everyone had their own opinions. Now we just know what's best for Il Divo. It's easy. Everything's easy. CNN: How are you being received in America? Miller: I think in America it's more of a slow burn. I think it's more difficult to put us on the radio because we fall between the cracks in a way. We're a little bit too pop for the classical stations, we're a bit too classical for the pop stations. And right now hip-hop and rap sort of reign supreme on the airwaves. But there is a big following and it's growing all the time. CNN: If there was someone you could collaborate with who you haven't yet, who would it be? Izambard: Beyonce. Christina Aguilera. Marin: Tina Turner. CNN: These are all pop acts. So you really do want to stay within the pop realm? Buhler: Yeah, definitely. I mean that's a very conscious choice. I don't think we're all opera purists, but for me personally, a ""Nessun Dorma"" [Puccini aria] is as good as it is and I don't see the point of adding a breathy voice, or adding harmonies to it. While the pop repertoire ... it's just more out there for everyone to take it and do with it whatever without offending people. All you want to do with a pop song is somehow transmit emotion. So far there's [been] much more freedom in pop music and that's why we stay in there ... we pretty much can do whatever we want. And as Simon Cowell just said recently, ""Nobody owns music.""",0.76775604,3461
20,"(CNN) -- Carly Smithson wants to make one thing clear: She is not the new lead singer of Evanescence. Former ""American Idol"" contestant Carly Smithson is the lead singer of the new band We Are The Fallen. There may be some confusion because the former ""American Idol"" contestant has joined forces with original Evanescence members Ben Moody, Rocky Gray and John LeCompt for the new band We Are The Fallen. The dark-haired Irish rocker made it to the top six during season seven of ""American Idol"" before being eliminated. Smithson said that since then, quite a few opportunities have come her way that were not a good fit. This new band, which also includes bassist Marty O'Brien, is perfect for her, Smithson said . Guitar player LeCompt agrees. ""I've said many times about Evanescence that we caught lightning in a bottle ... and I think we are doing it again,"" he said. ""Carly is a good fit for the band because more than anything she is a brilliant, brilliant vocalist who is very down to earth and a humble person. She wants to do something where everyone is involved rather than being a posturing diva."" Smithson recently spoke with CNN about why she is thankful to Moody's roommate, why the group gets along so well and how they want to collaborate with fans. CNN: You must be pretty psyched about this new band. Carly Smithson: I am. It's pretty awesome and everything I think we have all ever wanted. We all blend together and it's all about making business. CNN: With all of the opportunities that have come your way since ""Idol,"" why go this route? Smithson: I had a lot of the wrong opportunities approach me. They were very flattering offers, but musically not on the same page with where I envisioned myself. As soon as Ben [Moody] came to me, he was actually someone that I had in mind, after coming off the ""Idol"" tour, to go and try and work with. He's worked on some music that I had a lot of respect for and really admired, but he was busy, oddly enough, working on this project. CNN: So how did you two connect? Smithson: He had never watched ""American Idol"" and he didn't know who I was. I am good friends with his roommate who recently moved in and I had met him briefly. My friend came and saw me live and then planted the seed in his head. She said, ""You should really consider my friend for this band,"" and he said ""Who is your friend?"" She said, ""You know, the girl you met down the basement,"" and an artist he has been working with played him a bunch of YouTube clips of me. We were hanging out at about one in the morning and he called my friend and said, ""I just watched your friend. I should have done this a long time ago. Where is she, when can I meet her, I need to meet her right away."" She said, ""Well, actually we are out right now and we're going to be at the house in about 20 minutes."" We came back to the house and we had a meeting which lasted until about 4 a.m. ... Obviously it was a decision I needed to make very fast because they were looking for a singer and people don't wait forever. I called my manager and it was a done deal pretty much the next day. CNN: Sounds like it was meant to be. Smithson: Everybody was very excited and thought it was the right direction to go. I'm happy that it happened in such an organic way. It's really weird, but as people we are all very alike. We all like the same jokes, watch the same TV shows and play the same music. It's great. CNN: Do you at all feel pressure because of the success that Evanescence had? Smithson: No, because this is a new band. Evanescence is still out there. We are not Evanescence and our band isn't here to follow.  Watch Smithson talk about the new band » . I'm here to make music. Obviously I want to be successful but I think we all are in a contented place to make music. If we can grab some fans, that's great. If we can grab a bunch of fans, that's awesome. We are here to compete with ourselves and put out something epic. CNN: What does the name mean? Smithson: It's more of a statement rather than a name. We feel like our fans can say ""We Are The Fallen"" as well as us. It's not just a band name, it's kind of like a movement name. We are trying to create a group of people that are in to the same thing. It's a collaboration of our fans and us appreciating music that we are making. CNN: So what do you all stand for, since you want the fans to be a part of it. Smithson: Freedom. Every since we all came into this band, we feel so free to go and be who we are. I embrace that.",0.75985694,4927
21,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For someone who claims to be incredibly laid back, Jason Mraz is certainly piling up the accomplishments. Jason Mraz was recently honored with a songwriting award for his work, which includes the hit ""I'm Yours."" The singer-songwriter was the recipient of the Hal David Starlight Award at last week's Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee ceremony in New York. The honor typically goes to newcomers striking a chord in the music industry. Or, as Mraz puts it, ""I hope it has something to do with their savvy freshness."" Mraz, who turned 32 this week and took his parents to the celebratory dinner at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square June 18, says he feels great about the honor. ""I never thought my songs would escape my bedroom,"" he said. ""To have the music shared all around the world, and to be acknowledged by communities like this ... it's inspiring."" Mraz's 2008 album ""We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things"" has been a runaway success, with more than 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. It also led to three Grammy nominations, including song of the year and best male pop vocal performance for the reggae-inflected hit ""I'm Yours."" Mraz (whose name reflects his family's Czech heritage) hits the festival circuit overseas before kicking off his stateside ""Gratitude Café Tour"" July 25. The tour's quirky title was inspired by a wholesome San Francisco, California, restaurant Mraz loves. A fan of maintaining a diet of predominantly raw foods, Mraz is also a farmer of sorts: He owns an avocado farm in his home city of San Diego, California. He's also a juggler, a skill Mraz taught himself during the downtime that comes with touring.  Watch the multitalented Mraz perform » . Mraz shared tales of his avocado farm, as well as what it's like to get the cold shoulder from Simon Cowell, when he sat down with CNN recently. CNN: So, you live on an avocado farm. What's that like? Jason Mraz: It's fantastic. Anytime you're harvesting something in your yard -- whether you have a small herb garden or I've got avocados, and now we have a solar system so we're also harvesting sun energy, which is great -- for me that's when I became an environmentalist. I was like, ""Wait a second. This is my environment. This is my piece of the Earth that I'm responsible for."" Yes, the trees give me avocado and fruit that we sell and we eat tons of, but I feel like I have a role to play back to that, too. So it's cool. CNN: So if you're at home, daily how many avocados would you eat? Mraz: At least two. Sometimes three or four. CNN: So you must have very nice oily skin. Mraz: I do, thank you. It's the avocado. I just lather it on. CNN: Do you really? Mraz: I do. Yeah, why not? I've got tons of them! CNN: Do you cook? Mraz: I prepare. There's not much cooking in our household. We do a lot of raw food so it's more about putting the right ingredients together to create something scrumptious. See Mraz's chocomole recipe . CNN: When eating healthy is so important to you, how difficult is that to maintain when you're traveling around the world so much? Mraz: Well, I bring tons of backup supplies with me. CNN: How did you like performing on the ""American Idol"" final? (Mraz performed ""I'm Yours"" with contestants Anoop Desai and Alexis Grace.) Mraz: I loved it. It was such a great event. And I have compassion for every one of those kids that dares audition. I wasn't a contestant. I was just there to sing, and when I saw Simon at the end of that panel I freaked out. I was like, ""What does he think?"" And then I had to stop myself and say ""Dude, you're not a contestant."" He's aloof. But I watched during the rest of the night and he did it to all the acts. That's just his way. CNN: Do you think you could hack it as an ""American Idol"" contestant? Mraz: It is really tough. I watch what those guys do backstage between songs and their weekly schedule is super intense -- to learn new songs, to shoot videos, to learn dance moves and all this. They actually go through a pretty amazing transformation during the course of that show. I just don't know that I could commit myself to something like that. I'm a little more laid back. And some days if I can't show up to work, I don't show up to work. And I love that (laughs). CNN: Were you surprised by the success of ""I'm Yours""? Mraz: Very surprised. There's something simple about it ... like a nursery rhyme. I thought it was so playful. I never expected the world to really grab it and run with it the way they have. CNN: Can you talk me through how you went about writing that song? Where were you? What were you doing? Mraz: I was at home. It was a sunny afternoon. And just as any afternoon where I play music, I was playing on an electric guitar, just chugging around, feeling a little reggae in me you know, and the melody and the words just started to pop out rather quickly and so I recorded it rather quickly. And the whole process only took about a half an hour. CNN: You're about to go overseas to play various festivals. Is there anywhere you'll be going for the first time? Mraz: This year we're going to explore South America, which I've visited as a tourist, but I've never taken my music down there. I hear the crowds turn up in masses, so I really want to see what that's like. I love getting to bounce around and explore so much. I love Scandinavia. I love Spain. It's so mystical and romantic, yet it's gritty. CNN: Do you speak Spanish? Mraz: No, but I have the Rosetta Stone. I have begun my level one training.",0.758649,5451
22,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Mandy Moore stepped onto the small stage at Amoeba Records in Hollywood with a quick wave. Mandy Moore, now 25, is following her bliss with her new album, ""Amanda Leigh."" ""Hi, shoppers,"" she giggled somewhat self-consciously. The audience of several hundred, stuffed between the music racks at the landmark store, giggled back. ""This is so weird to be playing here. I live in the neighborhood, and this is where I get my CDs and my DVDs!"" she said. Then she launched into selections from her sixth studio album, ""Amanda Leigh."" Somewhere out of sight was her new husband, Ryan Adams -- the alt-country hero she married in March, after a one-month engagement. It's been 10 years since Moore burst onto the pop scene as a lanky, blonde 15-year-old singing and dancing her way through a sweetly suggestive tune called ""Candy.""  Her musical fare now is more eclectic and stripped down -- even featuring vintage instruments such as the clavinet and melodica.  Watch Moore talk candidly about her new direction » . Unlike such early contemporaries as Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, Moore has gone for cred over commercial success in both her music and movie careers, and it suits her well. There's an authenticity there, as well as a genuine warmth and charm. Moore spoke about her artistic growth, a musical funk, and working with her new husband. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: A friend of mine made an interesting analogy, saying these last two albums of yours (including 2007's folk-leaning ""Wild Hope"") are to your music career what ""Saved!"" was to your movie career, in terms of establishing yourself critically. Mandy Moore: I take that as a compliment. I mean, I sort of feel lucky to have the opportunity to do film stuff and music at the same time, because I love doing both. But ... if you make a move one way with one side of your career, you sort of have to balance it out on the other side. I feel like with the last two records, I have been in control creatively. They are probably more like some of the cooler indie movies that I have been lucky enough to get to do. CNN: You could have continued in the mainstream pop world, like some of the singers you came up with. Moore: I sort of started around the same time as a lot of my contemporaries, like the Britney Spearses and the Christina Aguileras of the world, and they are amazing and everybody is still around and doing their thing. I just never truly felt comfortable with the music that I was singing -- even back then. I mean, I was happy to have the opportunity, but I was still scratching my head, ""Well, there has got to be something else, there has got to be something more."" ... It's just about doing what you are truly passionate about and fighting for that. I could have stayed on the same path that I started on, and who knows what would have happened if I would have found success with that -- or none at all -- but I knew I would not have been happy if I had made that decision. And I'm doing what I love now, and I think that's more important than anything. CNN: The new album is called ""Amanda Leigh,"" which is your real name. So is this kind of a reintroduction to people about who you really are -- a grown-up Mandy Moore? Moore: To be quite honest, even though the record is called ""Amanda Leigh,"" and that is my given name, there wasn't a tremendous amount of thought behind the idea of ""This is the real me. Forget the Mandy Moore stuff. That's kid stuff."" No, it was kind of a simple, almost frivolous decision. My friend Mike Viola [of the Candy Butchers], who I wrote the whole record with, called me Amanda Leigh when we were in the studio all the time. Like ""Amanda Leigh, come on, we've got to get to work!"" And I don't know, it just sort of became synonymous with making the record to me. I had never really owned my name. It was just synonymous with my parents being mad at me. So I was like, ""All right, I'm 25, I'm a woman, I'm an adult. I think I can probably take ownership with that name now and be OK with it."" But I'm still happy to be Mandy at the end of the day. CNN: Well, you can actually change your name even further. You can go by Amanda Adams [her married name] these days. Moore: I'm going to really throw people off and completely change my name. That will be the next record. You know, just to throw a real wrench into the situation. CNN: I'm probably blowing it for you when you check into hotels under names that nobody would expect you to use. Moore: (Glancing over at her husband) Should I give my name? I'll have to change it, but it's time for a new one. I was Cornish Gamehen for a while, which was bizarre. But for the last couple years, I have been Meryl Inch -- however, there is too much of a debacle going on there these days to continue that. So I have to come up with something creative. CNN: What's it like to not be on a major label these days? There must be some freedom attached to it, but then you don't have the big bucks behind you, as well as the whole machinery. Moore: I don't think you need the whole machine, the whole middleman behind you nowadays, like in terms of a big record label giving you a push. ... I think it has allowed me the creative freedom to truly make the kind of music that I want to by being on an indie label. ... I'm much happier with this road. CNN: Was there a period of depression you went through that had you reworking things in your head, and trying to find out who you were? Moore: I think the writing process for the last record, for ""Wild Hope,"" I found myself in a bit of a funk. I don't know if I would necessarily classify it as a depression, but I was definitely in a very deeply, darkly place for me, and I had never really been there before. And there was a lot of investigation and questions bouncing around in my head that I found I could answer by kind of investing myself in music and writing. CNN: I would love to be a fly on the wall in your house, just to see the music that you and Ryan come up with. Moore: There is a lot of music in the house, whether someone is playing it, or there's a record on or something. I've been introduced to a lot of metal in my relationship, which is pretty cool, because my guy is a big metal fan, and it isn't something I would necessarily investigate on my own -- but I do like it. It's just nice to have that truly built-in support system that someone is unbelievably understanding of what you do. CNN: Like a lot of people, I was shocked when I read you and Ryan had gotten married. Moore: Yeah, we sort of snuck it by a lot of people. Pretty handy. That's how we roll. Life is good, and I'm a really lucky girl, and I'm very happy. It's a very exciting time to be 25 years old and truly fulfilled in so many aspects.",0.757094,5367
23,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Enya is an anomaly. Think about it: How many recording artists have enjoyed 20 years of success while never having toured? Enya sets her own pace when making albums. ""And Winter Came"" is her first CD in three years. ""The fans are very, very loyal,"" says the Irish chanteuse. ""They're always saying, 'When is the next album?' They know when I finish in the studio it's got to be a few years before the next album."" Perhaps it's the vast gaps between releases that help make Enya, 47, the Emerald Isle's second-biggest-selling artist of all time (after U2). Thanks to a stipulation in her recording contract, the Grammy winner has the luxury of setting her own pace with each project, another rarity in the music business. She'll devote two to three years to each album, flitting between her Dublin castle and the studio, where she works tirelessly to perfect every celestial chord and layer harmony upon harmony. ""I always felt that the music sells by itself,"" she says. ""The music has always been the successful aspect on my career and that means that, to me, I can always still stay very focused on music.""  Watch Enya revel in harmony » . Her latest album -- the seventh of her career -- celebrates both the drama and quiet contemplation that come with the winter season. Called ""And Winter Came,"" the release has reached the top 10 on album charts across Europe and in the U.S. since its November release. And while Enya won't commit to the idea of taking her tunes on the road, she does hint at the possibility. ""To actually tour with the songs would be wonderful. It would be very much on a large scale: the orchestra, the choir. There'd be a lot of rehearsals, but it'd be very exciting,"" she says. Enya spoke to CNN about how her music is like an onion (think layers, not tears), keeping a low profile, and marking the 20-year anniversary of ""Watermark,"" her breakout album. CNN: What does wintertime mean to you? Enya: Wintertime for me is a time when I do a lot of my writing in the studio. It's a time I enjoy. And it's very reflective and a very calming time of the year. Throughout the year I gather a lot of musical inspirations and this is where I bring them to the studio and see what will evolve musically. CNN: You set out to make a Christmas album. How did the project evolve? Enya: I've always wanted to put together a Christmas album. So I was writing some Christmas carols and what happened was some of the songs started to veer more into winter themes. And when I discussed it with [producer and lyricist] Nicky and Roma [Ryan], they felt, well, within winter is the celebration of Christmas, so let's infuse the two themes together. CNN: A lot of people think of Enya as a soloist, but really you're kind of a trio, aren't you? Enya: I work with two other people, the producer Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan, the lyricist. The way I work with Nicky and Roma is firstly I do the writing of the melodies in the songs, and that's kind of the solitude moment for me in the studio, which I enjoy very much. When I have the melody -- the idea of the melody -- I play that to Nicky and Roma. ... I get to see their reaction immediately. Is this a song for the album? And I can see from their reaction -- ""Yes, this is going to work,"" or perhaps it's not. There are a lot of ideas that Nicky had wanted to experiment with. When I met with him first he had this idea of using a voice -- one voice -- as an instrument to layer many times and he knew my love of harmonies. Some people who hear the songs think that we have a set routine, a set formula we work with. It isn't, ... because each song is very different, and it's very spontaneous on my part. CNN: About the layering of your voice ... at any given time how many Enyas might we be listening to? Enya: I don't count! It's a very spontaneous moment on my behalf. I will listen back to the last harmony I've sung, and then I'll sort of try to enhance that harmony. Then Nicky will decide if he'll record my voice 20 times or 30 times [for] that one part. CNN: I read that you might [record] as many as 80 vocal tracks. Is that a reasonable number? And then I read 500. That's got to be ridiculous! Enya: Yes, it can be, but you have to remember that [if] it's 500 vocals I wouldn't have sung them at the same time. We're talking about over two years that we keep going back to arrange vocal parts on these songs. It's a very slow process. CNN: It's hard to believe that it was about 20 years ago that you made ""Watermark."" Do you ever go back and listen to that record? Enya: Well, with the anniversary, yes, I've been listening to ""Watermark."" It's kind of like a journal for me. It takes you back to that time in your life. Each song has its own little story and I can hear the life of that song. You know how it was written, what inspired me, what worked, what didn't work. But the nice thing about spending two to three years on an album is I can say there's nothing I would change on any of the albums. CNN: You've said that you change the formula a little with each album, but to an untrained ear your music has sort of stayed the same throughout your career. Are you a believer in the saying ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? Enya: Musically it has to be something that I'm comfortable to perform. Would we ever hear Enya with a guitar solo? I say, ""Never say never."" And there's a guitar solo on ""My! My! Time Flies."" This happened because it suited the song. It's always got to sound like me because it's my voice and there's always this little sense of melancholy that is inherent in my melodies. I think that's because of my Irish culture. CNN: Your manager has suggested that one of the secrets to your success is that you keep a fairly low profile. Do you agree? Enya: It's very easy for me to keep a low profile because the focus I feel is always on the music. Success and fame are two different things. And so I feel the success is always towards the music, which means that I can have a very normal and private lifestyle.",0.751311,4311
24,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- We halfway expect the four members of Kings of Leon to roll into Bar 1200 drunk and brawling, a burly tour manager leading them in by the scruff of their necks. Kings of Leon is a family affair, consisting of three brothers and their cousin. Instead, a uniformed valet ushers them in, one by one, offering each a flute of champagne -- which Caleb Followill, the singer, and Nathan Followill, the drummer, politely accept. ""We have a bunch of rooms at the hotel, and the valet came with the floor,"" they explain, shaking their heads in amazement. The hipster lounge we've gathered in is in the lobby of the Sunset Marquis in West Hollywood, California. A framed black-and-white photo of the Kings hangs in a spot of honor: closest to the bar. It's autographed, with a inscription that reads, ""Scene of the crime!"" Kings of Leon's fourth album, ""Only by the Night,"" has sold 5 million copies worldwide and spun off three hit singles, catapulting the group into that elite fraternity of bona fide rock bands that enjoy airplay on both pop and rock stations. These days, the Followill four -- brothers Caleb, Nathan and Jared, along with their cousin, Matthew -- are fulfilling the promise that so many critics predicted early in their career. Their majestic, tension-filled brand of Southern garage rock has its roots in, of all things, the church. The brothers' dad, Ivan, was a traveling Pentecostal preacher who led raucous, revivalist-style congregations. Both he and his father went by the name Leon. His boys have carried on in his road warrior tradition. The stage is their pulpit, their congregation, 20,000-seat arenas. The following is an edited version of our interview. CNN: It's been a great couple of years for you. Do you feel your lives have changed? Caleb Followill: Absolutely. It's just a strange thing for us, because we've had success in the past, but a great majority of it hasn't been in America. And when it starts to happen in America, you turn into a wild person again. ""Oh, let's party!"" CNN: Is it really true that you guys can consume more alcohol than any other band out there on the road? Jared Followill: Collectively, it's a possibility. Caleb: I mean, we can consume more alcohol than any other popular band that actually works. As soon as we say ""thank you"" and ""good night,"" that means it's time for us to have fun. We're sober in the mornings. Most mornings. CNN: Are you sober now? Caleb: Yes. Nathan Followill: Not really. (Laugh) CNN: You guys are also famous for your fights. Rolling Stone had two of you at each other's throats. A $7,000 mirror was apparently involved -- . Caleb: And we were so mad about what they said that we got into a big fight. Nah, I'm kidding. A lot of the stories that come out about us fighting absolutely aren't true. CNN: Are all of you still in your 20s? Nathan: I cracked the 30s! June 26th. Caleb: We're about to Menudo his ass and get someone younger. CNN: You grew up with religion at the center of your life. How do you think it's worked its way into what you do now and what we hear coming out of the stereo? Caleb: I grew up with my dad as a preacher, and so you hear Bible verses. I've always looked at the Bible as poetry, so I kind of learned to write in that style from time to time. And a lot of people misconstrued that as me trying to push something on someone. We're all sinners. (Looks at Nathan) Look at him drinking the devil's grape juice. (The others chuckle) CNN: You played music when you were growing up, but it was associated with the church. Nathan: It was more like black gospel music, like Aretha Franklin, Al Green -- fun music to play. Most people hear, ""Oh, you played in church,"" and they picture an organ, and just very quiet. It was very lively and wild. Caleb: The thing that inspired me about the music we grew on is that it was human music. The people that got up to play, they basically just got up there and told the story of what happened to them that day. Nathan: It was like the blues. With a little Jesus. Caleb: (demonstrates by imitating a blues singer) ""Today, I went to Walmart. Da da da da. I saw someone walking down the aisle, da da da da."" For me, it was inspiring. I thought, ""Man, I want to make up some songs."" CNN: On your current album, ""Only by the Night,"" your music has gotten bigger and more anthemic. Can we attribute that to the time you've spent hanging out with U2? Caleb: We spent a big chunk as the opening band for U2 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam -- and when we walked out into these venues, let's face it, there might have been 200 people in a 20,000-seat venue. And so we would start playing our songs, and when we'd play it, it would sound bigger than anything we'd ever heard, because it was bouncing off the walls. So then we'd start to soundcheck in all these big places, and the songs started to build. But you never know. The next one could be raw and dirty and gritty and really small. We like to keep people guessing. CNN: How did your parents react to your saying, ""Hey, Mom and Dad, I want to be in a rock band."" Caleb: They took it pretty well. They supported us pretty good. We had to lie our way through it a little bit. Matthew's family didn't know he was actually going to be in the band. We told them he was going to spend the summer with us but -- . Matthew Followill: Never came home. CNN: Right now, your dad is on the road with you, Matthew. Matthew: Yeah, he's only out for a couple of shows. Our family always comes to hang out. CNN: Looks like you'd better get him some sunscreen. He's a little red. Caleb: That's not from sun. That's actually from alcohol. He gets really red in the face after a long bender.",0.7486554,9916
25,"MALMO, Sweden (CNN) -- The breathy vocals of Nina Persson helped launch The Cardigans onto the music scene in the 1990s. The band developed its dreamy pop sound in the Southern Swedish town of Malmo. Singer Nina Persson finds musical inspiration in love and relationships. They were catapulted to international success in 1997, when the single ""Lovefool"" appeared on the soundtrack for ""Romeo and Juliet,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The song's chorus (""Love me, love me, say that you love me"") became a pop anthem. In addition to fronting The Cardigans, Persson, 34, has worked on solo projects under the name A Camp. Now, after a near decade long hiatus, her second A Camp album, ""Colonia,"" is due out later this month. Persson, who splits her time between New York and Malmo, talks to CNN's ""My City, My Life"" about music, inspiration and life after ""Lovefool."" CNN: How did The Cardigans start? Nina Persson: We formed the band in this town where we are all originally from -- Jonkoping -- and that was in 1992. Magnus and Peter were the two guys who actually met and wanted to form the band. And then they recruited people and I was one of the first to be recruited, along with a friend of mine who played guitar in the first version of The Cardigans. I had not sung before that really. I was sort of hired because they knew they wanted a girl singing. And I was like 'I'm a girl' and I guess we got along well and I was willing to learn to sing. So that's how it started really.  Watch Nina take CNN on a tour of her favorite Malmo spots » . CNN: How big was music in your life before you joined the band? Nina Persson: I've loved music my whole life. But I never really listened to a record and thought that was something that I wanted to do. I was interested in becoming a painter, an architect, a designer. Those are the things I was interested in. But music, I never took instrument classes -- it was a random thing to start doing. CNN: Sometime a career finds you? Nina Persson: Yeah and I was a person who was really helped by it. I was looking for something but I didn't know what it was and it proved to fulfill what I needed at the time. CNN: How is A Camp different from The Cardigans? Nina Persson: It's hard to say what makes it different because I'm still doing the same thing -- I'm still writing songs and singing them -- but it feels like it's a bigger freedom because I am in charge in A Camp. I like both. Both serve good purposes. I like to be in the collective, being part of the machinery, but I also really enjoy being dictator. CNN: How do you define yourself as a musician now? Nina Persson: Well I'm not. I'm not one of these people who live and breathe music. In the beginning I was a reluctant musician -- I still haven't bothered to learn an instrument. I'm still only a singer and that's how I write my songs. I'm always superstitious that if I do learn an instrument I would pop the bubble a bit. CNN: Is there anything else you would have liked to have done if you hadn't done singing? Nina Persson: At the time when I was found, picked up by the band, I was into art. I was really good at drawing, really creative. I made stuff, I built stuff, I sewed stuff. I thought I would end up in that world somewhere. Photography was a big thing for me. In retrospect, I'm sure that could have been a good career for me. But recently I've started to wish that I could start over and dedicate my life to medicine. I would have loved to go to med school. I don't think I will because I don't want to spend seven or eight years in training, but I dream about working in a hospital. CNN: What were your inspirations over the years? Nina Persson: That's an incredibly difficult question to answer, but I think I'm a sucker for constantly going back to the subject of love and relationships. It also varies very much from project to project and month to month. I'm very emotional when it comes to the music. I want to make people cry. CNN: Tell us the story of how the band ended up in Malmo.  See photos of Nina in Malmo » . Nina Persson: We moved here because we started to record in Tambourine Studios which was here. Most studios are in Stockholm so sort of all roads wanted to drag us to Stockholm but we did persist and came here. CNN: When you came to Malmo, what was it like starting out in the early days? Nina Persson: Our parents helped us move down here which was really sweet. They sort of dropped us off and waved goodbye and we moved in. We really did hang out, the five of us, quite exclusively in the beginning. CNN: What was the area like back then? Has it changed? Nina Persson: Well actually the area where I now live hasn't changed that much. A lot of Malmo has moved away from the blue collar past it has, but not that area. It has strangely remained the same, and I like it. CNN: Do you think the gritty atmosphere of Malmo has helped you stay grounded? Nina Persson: Well it's hard to say how much has to do with the people we are or how much to do with Malmo. But there certainly is something here that does not encourage big headedness. CNN: The musical heritage of Malmo is quite rocky. How did you guys fit in? Nina Persson: People thought we were really ridiculous when we came to this totally rock place and played pop music. So we didn't fit in at all -- we were never part of the scene here. CNN: You were happy to be outsiders of the rocky heritage? Nina Persson: I think we felt sort of cool about doing our own thing. We thought we knew something that the others didn't understand. CNN: Is there something about Malmo that helps shape your music or influence you? Nina Persson: I think Malmo did have a big influence on us. Obviously we came here for the sound, and we got the sound we wanted. We were away from the industry -- that was great for us. I really did appreciate being in a place where there is not a lot whole of press and industry. Nina takes . CNN: So you also live in New York. What brings you back to Malmo? Nina Persson: For me, I love Malmo very much because of my friendships. In Malmo I get the intimacy and get to run into my friends in the street once in a while which is a lovely feeling and I get to have a great grocery store just around the corner. CNN: If Malmo was a person, what kind of person would it be? Nina Persson: It would be somebody who has been around for a while and survived a lot of hardships -- somebody you don't mess with, somebody really intelligent, stubborn, with a lot of beauty on the inside.",0.74721503,1814

Holly Williams is daughter of musician Hank Williams Jr. and granddaughter of musician Hank Williams Sr. The chic women's store is named H. Audrey after her maternal grandmother, who was the first wife of the late country music icon Hank Williams. Holly's father is Bocephus -- the legendary hellraiser and three-time CMA Entertainer of the Year otherwise known as Hank Williams Jr. She got her height from him. With heels on, she's about 6-foot-3 -- all tanned legs and long, blonde hair. She looks like a star. And at 28, she wants to earn the right to be one. Williams just released her sophomore album, ""Here With Me"" (Mercury Nashville). Most of the 11 tracks are self-penned, and she sings them with emotional honesty in a smoky, soulful voice. The characters in her lyrics are friends, family and lovers from the past. She also has a man in her present: On July 24, she became engaged to Chris Coleman, the drummer in her band.  Watch Williams show off her talents » . Williams spoke with CNN about her new album and her family's legacy. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your new album was released the same day as your dad's new album. Was that planned? Holly Williams: It wasn't planned at all. About three weeks before my release, I was looking over to see who else was coming out that day, and it said, ""Hank Jr."" -- and I'm going, ""Is this something my manager planned?"" And it's just so random, because out of the 52 weeks of the year, it just happened. CNN: What did he think about the album? Williams: Well, this is embarrassing, but I haven't sent him a copy yet! I need to. He's heard two of the singles. He's always been a huge supporter of the songwriting, and just been a great encourager with me. CNN: What was it like when you were growing up? Williams: Well, my mom raised my sister and me. [My parents] split when we were 3 and 5, and he was touring 300 nights a year. We'd see him every few months when he was off the road, and we'd go up there and hunt and fish and be on the farm. But my mom did all the rules and curfews and all that. CNN: Your mother doesn't seem jaded by the music industry at all. Williams: Oh, she doesn't at all. They split in '83, so when they first got married in '77, he was still a struggling artist and doing small theater shows. My single out right now is called ""Mama"" that I wrote ... is kind of a thank-you song, because she was always the most positive influence -- had so much light. My dad always talks about what a great mom she was, and they're still close friends. CNN: What was it like for you going into the music industry? Was there a lot of pressure? Williams: The songwriting hit me at a very young age. Eight, 9, 10 is when I started writing. Went away from it for a few years, and at 17 picked up a guitar and it was just on from there. I'm 28 now, and I've been doing it for 10 years nonstop. I put out an EP myself when I was 20, and paid 200 bucks for my Web site, and traveled over in the U.K. alone with a backpack. And in the U.S., I just took my mom's Suburban and followed everyone from Train, John Mellencamp, Billy Bob Thornton -- everyone's bus -- and just did any show I could, whether they paid or not. Just played, played, played. CNN: Do you remember the first song you wrote when you were 8? Williams: I do. The first song I wrote was called ""Who Am I,"" and it's funny because it was very serious. I had a very happy childhood, but it was very introspective about this broken marriage, and I wanted Tiffany or Debbie Gibson to cut it. I remember just telling my mom, ""Just please call the publishing company. ... ""I was so ambitious. I remember making cassette tapes and mailing them to Music Row. CNN: What was the reaction from those tapes? Williams: I'm sure there was never any response. I'm sure people just laughed. I was not as talented as Taylor Swift when I was 15, 16. I could write a decent song, but I couldn't sing that well at that age. CNN: You have a love for rock 'n' roll. Why did you go into country with this album? Williams: Growing up in my house, you would assume I was growing up around country music with my dad being Hank Williams Jr. But he did not bring music home. He always said, ""I'm not Bocephus to you. I'm Daddy."" So I was really left to my own devices to find music on my own. And I really fell in love with the singer-songwriters of the '70s -- Tom Waits, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Carole King -- that whole era really struck me. And when I heard Hank Williams Sr.'s name mentioned from those people -- from Leonard Cohen to Bruce Springsteen -- that's what really brought me back around to learning more about my grandfather. My music is still based in that singer-songwriter tradition. Adding a fiddle and steel guitar makes it more country, and adding blazing electric guitars makes it more rock. I'm on a country label now. CNN: You also own a clothing boutique in Nashville called H. Audrey. Williams: Everything I have on, except my shoes, is from there. ... It's a struggle in this economy, but we make enough to pay our payroll and buy the clothes. And it's nice to fold jeans every now and again, and get my mind out of myself. CNN: When you're writing down your goals on your wish list, what is it you really want? Williams: I would love to sell a million records. I would love to play in arenas -- but what I really want to build is a core fanbase, and just hopefully build a place in the Williams family.",0.7465648,5550
29,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Annie Lennox has incredible eyes. Annie Lennox's new album, a best-of, will be her last with Sony. They're a translucent blue-green, both kind and inviting in one glance, then piercing and all-knowing in another. At 54, Lennox's orbs are as captivating today as they were when they stared at us from under that fiery orange crew cut in the music video for the Eurythmics hit ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)."" That was 1983. Yes, Lennox's Eurythmics days seem like a lifetime ago for the Scotland-born singer-songwriter, especially when you consider the successful solo career she's enjoyed since her partnership with Dave Stewart. It's that body of work -- songs like 'Why"" and ""No More 'I Love You's' "" that are showcased on her newest album, ""The Annie Lennox Collection."" It's Lennox's fifth solo outing, and her final album with her record label of 30 years, Sony Music Entertainment. ""It's like a demarcation line in a way because there is that body of work to look back on in retrospect,"" says Lennox. ""And the future is ahead of me and that's very interesting because I'm really not sure exactly what that's going to mean logistically ... how that's going to pan out. But I'm very excited about it because of Internet technology.""  Watch Lennox talk about catharsis » . Lennox, who's won Grammys, BRIT Awards and an Academy Award (for co-writing ""Into the West"" from ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King""), says she's become somewhat of a voracious blogger, using her MySpace page and official Web site not only as a repository for her musical work, but also to lend a voice to her humanitarian efforts. In 2007, Lennox formed the SING Campaign, a nonprofit initiative to help fight the HIV pandemic in Africa. The initiative has its own anthem, called ""SING,"" which features vocals from Madonna and Celine Dion among others, and is included on Lennox's new album. She also recorded two new tracks to celebrate the release, one a cover of Irish band Ash's hit song ""Shining Light."" ""It's one of those incredible anthemic songs that just stay with you,"" she says. ""It's like when you heard Jeff Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah.' It's almost like a revelation when you hear it."" Lennox spoke to CNN about tapping into her inner divas to make those theatrical music videos, the pitfalls of fame and why she celebrates her naiveté. CNN: Who is your ""shining light""? Annie Lennox: Ordinary people who don't necessarily have the spotlight shone on them, who do extraordinary things. Those people always inspire me. A lot of people that are working in nongovernmental organizations inspire me very much, because I think those people are really risking life and limb to make a difference to people's lives in really impossible circumstances. And they really give me the sense that if they can do that, I can do something, too. CNN: How do you feel about where you are in life right now? Lennox: Of course now I'm in that middle-age place, age-wise, and youth is no longer really something that I'm a part of anymore. And that started happening for me when I was about 40, to be honest with you. I had my kids and my focus went elsewhere. And I think I've changed so much through having children ... inside myself. It's been a kind of evolution and a maturity. And that has informed the SING Campaign a lot, because my focus is really on women. ... I understand what it is for a woman to want to protect their children and give them the best they can. And so I identify with that. ... I can let go of some of the things I was maybe focused on when I was younger and I'm focused on different things. CNN: Over the years your music videos have served as an outlet to explore different personas. Is that a cathartic experience for you? Lennox: Performance feels quite cathartic, to be honest with you. It's a good feeling. And songwriting is cathartic because you have something you want to express. ... Ultimately when you've completed that songwriting process there is a sense of yes ... completion. It's out. It's expressed. It's done. And then you can communicate it to other people in performance. CNN: You come across as extremely fearless in your videos. Yet you've said as a person you're quite shy. You don't seem shy to me. Lennox: No I'm not shy right now, but I can be quite shy. It depends on the circumstances. ... Shyness is actually quite crippling. When one is shy it's not helpful. But a lot of being on stage has given me that opportunity to go beyond my normal persona. CNN: Which music video are you most proud of? Lennox: Quite a few. I think that ""Broken Glass"" is just ... it's hilarious. A lot of the things I do have got humor in them. But the fact that we had John Malkovich who came in and Hugh Laurie who was there ... we had a big cast. CNN: A lot of your songs are about pain and failed relationships. Do you still feel that you have a lot to learn about love? Lennox: I think we all do. I think the world needs to be a far more loving place. And I think we are confused between erotic love [and] unconditional love. I think our sexuality is a very different thing from our love. ... We are a society fixated with sexuality and it can be very cruel. When the love, and the respect and the consideration [are] missing, people live very isolated existences. CNN: What has fame taught you? Lennox: I think fame for fame's sake is a very toxic thing. ... And people in this society have this idea that they wanna be famous, and they don't know what for. And they pursue ""celebrity"" for itself. I would say that without something to offer, whether it be that you're an actor, you have a craft, you have something to offer people, if you're a writer, a painter, a musician ... when it's just about you and your actual life it's a little bit cannibalistic. The industry of celebrity is quite a savage one and when you fall foul of it, and your privacy is so brutally invaded ... you may be having difficulties in your own life as we all do ... and all the images of you, your dogs, your children, the inside of your house ... they're all splattered across every front page, I think that's [a] very unhealthy place to be. And I think it's sad that people caught it so vociferously. CNN: Well you obviously raised two children. How difficult was it to shield them from your fame? Lennox: It hasn't been too difficult. Part of my work is public, but I make a distinction between that and who I am as a person in private. ... I was very careful that ... I wasn't telling stories to gossip papers, and showing my life and [my children] were gently kept away from that. CNN: Fame also serves as a useful platform, and you've been very involved with various charities, notably HIV/AIDS. Do you ever feel frustrated that you you're not making as big a difference as you would like? Lennox: I had to think about this very carefully because I understand that there are so many problems in the world. Infinitely. And there always will be. That will never change, no. ... And if you make this decision to get involved, don't think that there's just an end result and that's what you're aiming for. No, it's the day-to-day commitment. It's the small steps that really count, in my opinion. CNN: I've read that you consider yourself to be quite naive. Is that still true? Lennox: I still have an aspect of naiveté, and I think it's a valuable thing, because if I was jaded and cynical 100 percent as I could be, you know I would be less human and I think my acknowledgment that I can be naive is fine. It's part of being human.",0.74614835,2527
30,"(CNN) -- Josh Rouse is a chameleon. And a busy one, too. Josh Rouse has made his name with well-crafted songs in a variety of styles. Listeners to his first album, 1998's ""Dressed Up Like Nebraska,"" may have lumped him into the alt-country movement. Aside from Rouse's rough, intimate voice, that album sounds little like 2003's ""1972,"" which features songs such as ""Love Vibration"" and ""Comeback (Light Therapy)"" and has a funkier, more upbeat production to match. The 36-year-old singer's willingness to follow several paths may have come from moving around as a child. Rouse was born in Nebraska and grew up around the West and the South. ""It really shaped me as a person,"" he told the Toronto Sun. ""There's an openness to the sound that I think I got from moving to, say, a big city in California to a Wyoming town of five or six hundred."" Though he has yet to have a breakthrough single in the United States, his music has appeared in the movie ""Vanilla Sky"" and TV shows including ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Party of Five."" He's also admired by fellow songwriters. In 2004, the Australian newspaper The (Melbourne) Age noted Rouse was going to have dinner with Edie Brickell, the ""What I Am"" singer who is married to Paul Simon. ""She called me and said, 'I love ""1972,"" ' and I was like, 'I was listening to you when I was 16 -- and you're married to Paul Simon!' "" Rouse told the paper. On the business side, he's marching to his own drummer. On joshrouse.com, Rouse's Web site, he sells his ""Bedroom Classics"" -- dozens of songs Rouse recorded live or in random locations (hotel rooms, apartments) available to fans. For those who like a more traditional medium, the CD, Rhino Records recently compiled a two-disc set of Rouse's material -- including several demos and outtakes -- for ""The Best of the Rykodisc Years,"" which covers the first seven years of Rouse's career. ""Listening to this collection of tracks taken ... it's plain that Josh Rouse arrived fully formed,"" writes Allmusic.com's Tim Sendra. ""From his first release ... he was already a thoughtful writer with a heartbreakingly intimate voice and the unfailing ability to wrap his melancholy in warm and sweet melodies."" Rouse answered several questions via e-mail for CNN.com. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your music showcases a number of styles -- the fairly basic sound of the early records, the early-'70s infused stuff from ""1972,"" and then there are songs like ""Miserable South"" that would sound comfortable coming from Otis Redding or Al Green. So, though it's a cliché, what are your influences? Josh Rouse: Anything that is soulful and honest is an influence. There are too many musicians/writers to name. CNN: Are you surprised that Rhino put together a ""best of""? Rouse: No, I was aware that they were planning on doing it. It's nice to reflect on the body of work I've created. CNN: One of your songs, ""Directions,"" was on the ""Vanilla Sky"" soundtrack. What effect, if any, did this have on your career? Rouse: Well, I got to meet Cameron Crowe, and he seemed nice. I'm sure it exposed my music to some people who might not of heard it otherwise. However, it did not have a Zach Braff effect on my career. CNN: With all the material on the Web, as well as your albums, you're obviously a prolific songwriter. Has it been helpful to put all that out there, or have some people criticized you for releasing too much, as Ryan Adams has been criticized? Rouse: More than being criticized for releasing a lot, I think it's more difficult to receive a lot of attention for one specific record. Sometimes [the] press doesn't want to write on a songwriter they just wrote about a year or two ago. I think my fan base is grateful. CNN: Which of your songs are among your favorites, and why? Which would you like to have back -- or rework? Rouse: ""1972"" is a beautiful song all the way around. I don't think I ever want to rework anything. I'm constantly trying to move forward. Sometimes you say, ""I wish that was faster, etc."" but it I'm not going to go back and re-record it. CNN: In the album notes, you mention that you write best when you're in motion -- getting ideas for melodies in taxicabs, for example. How do you hold on to those? Rouse: If they're good, I can usually remember them. I also have a variety of small handheld recorders. CNN: You've got songs referring to Nebraska, the Hamptons, Nashville ... have you thought of pulling a Sufjan Stevens and profiling a state? Rouse: No, and I'm not sure half of those Sufjan songs are profiling a state. However, it makes for a great marketing tool. CNN: You say you feel as if these albums are your ""first stage."" What's next? Rouse: I'm currently working on an Afro-Brazilian record in Spanish.",0.7457641,7677
31,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- We were scheduled to speak with Steve Martin just after his sound check for a concert in Los Angeles to benefit the city's public libraries. We pulled into the parking structure 45 minutes early when my cell phone rang. It was Martin's publicist. Steve Martin has been playing the banjo for decades. His new album is a collection of bluegrass tunes. ""Hey, where are you?"" she asked urgently. ""We're in the garage,"" I replied. ""Can you get up here quickly? He's ready."" A musician ready early? There goes his street cred. Interviewing Martin can be like an awkward first date. Like many comedians, he's polite, but he sometimes struggles to make eye contact, gives monosyllabic answers and leaves the impression that he wants to be anywhere but talking to you. But when the subject is his new album, ""The Crow: New Songs for the Five-String Banjo,"" he's chatty, enthusiastic and engaged. On the CD, the comic/actor/novelist/playwright/musician shows off his picking skills as well as his ability to craft witty bluegrass songs with titles such as ""Hoedown at Alice's,"" ""Wally on the Run"" and ""Late for School."" It's been his passion for 45 of his 63 years. This past weekend, the ultimate Hollywood hyphenate made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry. ""The Crow"" has received more than respectable reviews, but that's not surprising, given Martin's uncanny ability to excel in whatever he does -- except maybe idle chitchat. The following is an edited version of the interview: . CNN: People know you as a versatile artist, but now it's about the banjo and your bluegrass album, ""The Crow: New Songs for the Five-String Banjo."" Steve Martin: I did a lot of things when I first started out. In order to be in show business, I juggled, I did magic tricks, cards tricks and I played the banjo. CNN: You've been playing it for 45 years, right? Martin: Yes, I have. It's a long time, and I remember when I was going through a particularly difficult time of learning, I'd go, ""Well, if I just stick with it, one day I'll be saying, 'I've been playing for 40 years.' "" CNN: Picking up the banjo might seem likely if you grew up in the Appalachians -- maybe Kentucky or somewhere down South. But you grew up in Garden Grove, California. This is the O.C. Martin: There was a lot of musical activity in Orange County in the 1960s. There were the Dillards, and Doc Watson would come by, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, all these different players. I also had this friend, John McEuen, in high school, and he played, and he actually produced this album now -- 45 years later. [McEuen is a founding member of country-bluegrass group, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.] . CNN: Isn't John the one who taught you how to do an ""Open D"" tuning on the banjo? Martin: Yes, he did. CNN: See, I read your CD liner notes. [Both laugh] There's a cute little story in there about taking a photo of the three things you love most -- your wife, your dog and the banjo. Martin: Well, we all love more things that that. I just happened to take a photo, and there was my wife, my dog and my banjo, all in the same shot -- and I thought, ""Oh, that's like a family portrait right there."" CNN: Sounds like your next Christmas card to me. ... You're playing a benefit for the Los Angeles Public Library. Martin: As you can see, it's sold out [gestures to an empty room]. ... You know, it's also a little bit sneaky, because doing a benefit takes the pressure off having to be so great. This is the first time I've really played banjo live as a concert -- ever. I mean, I've played a song or two, but I've never done a dozen songs, so I hope people will be forgiving. CNN: Are you nervous at all? Martin: I'm a little nervous. CNN: Really? A little butterfly or two? I'm surprised. Martin: No butterflies, but it's very different playing music onstage if you're not used to it. I mean, doing comedy is one thing. I used to get nervous on that, but I was very practiced. I'm as practiced as I can be. I'm performing with the Steep Canyon Rangers, a group I met in North Carolina. They're a renowned bluegrass group -- young men who play and sing really, really well. I'm lucky to have them. CNN: You've won three Grammys and an Emmy. You do all kinds of things -- a modern-day Renaissance man. Martin: Well, in a strange way, I don't have a job, so I have a lot of time on my hands. When I do work, it might be very concentrated, and it might be months where you're not really doing anything except maybe playing the banjo or writing something. You know, there's a lot of time in the day if you're not working 9 to 5. CNN: Writing books, writing plays, doing comedy, writing music? Martin: It's been a long life. CNN: So have you decided whether you're going to embark on a full-fledged tour? Martin: I'm kind of seeing if -- you know, I haven't really performed for a long, long time -- 30 years live onstage. You know, I've done things like host the Oscars and things like that. But it's a little different. You have to get comfortable, you really have to know what you're doing, and it has to be almost boring to you to be able to do it well. You have to be so confident. I need to get some shows under my belt just to feel really good about it. CNN: They always say comedians are the least confident people in the entertainment industry. Do you feel like you're not confident? Martin: No, I feel confident, but I know what they mean because when you tell a joke, it might last six seconds, and then you have to tell another joke. But a song lasts three minutes, and then you have another song for three minutes and you've killed six minutes. In that time, a comedian does 360 jokes. Might not be the right math but anyway. CNN: When you guest-hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in January, you performed one of the songs on your new album -- which you immediately made available on the Web. Martin: It was an exclusive release on Amazon because I knew I was doing ""SNL,"" and I wanted the record to be available, and the only way you could get it available that quickly was electronically. And now it's out on Rounder in a more normal release now. CNN: Are you a big iPod guy who downloads stuff constantly? Martin: I do, a lot. I find a lot of songs that way. I use the Internet a lot to find music. I always download it legally -- especially my own songs. [Laughs] I think it's very important to keep that honor among yourselves. CNN: Who do you find a lot of your fans are musically? Are they people who have followed your career from the early days of ""SNL""? Martin: I honestly don't know. It's too new. I don't know if there are any fans. I know that the record sold really well on Amazon, but you know there's a bluegrass audience for bluegrass music, and there's probably an audience that wants to see, ""OK, let's see if this idiot can play."" CNN: Can you? Martin: We'll see tonight. [Laughs] I do have a record out.",0.74531275,6950
32,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Male singers regularly photographed wearing a hat are usually covering up a receding hairline. Jason Aldean has had six Top 10 country singles. His new album, ""Wide Open,"" is just out. But not Jason Aldean. He has a full head of hair, and wears a cowboy hat to signify his commitment to country music. The same is true for his well-fitting jeans and cowboy boots. It's a formula that seems to be working. The 32-year-old rising star has just notched his sixth Top 10 country single with ""She's Country,"" the lead track off his third CD, ""Wide Open"" (Broken Bow). We caught up with the Georgia native in his dressing room before a recent sold-out show at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, California. The following is an edited version of the interview. Jason Aldean: Definitely a cowboy hat in L.A. makes you stand out a little bit. CNN: It's a fashion statement in L.A. Aldean: It is! You've got to wear it with confidence, too.  Watch Aldean talk about his new album » . CNN: Are you nervous about your new album? Aldean: I wouldn't say I'm nervous. If you have an album that you're kind of on the fence about, then yeah, you would be kind of a little nervous. CNN: Have you ever had one of those -- or if you had, would you admit it? Aldean: When we went in to record the second album (2007's ""Relentless,"" which went gold), I think it was a good album, but I felt like I was under a lot of pressure recording that album -- more than the other two. You hear people talking about the sophomore slump and all that stuff, and so I think all that stuff sort of got to me after a while. Combined with being on the road 200 to 250 days [a year], I just didn't have that much fun recording it. I was exhausted. And so going into this third album, I just feel like mentally, I was back in the right place. CNN: As an artist, do you ever really think you got it right? Aldean: If at any point you're recording an album and you think it's the greatest thing that you've ever done, and you'll never be able to top it, then you should probably quit. Michael Jackson -- he made ""Thriller,"" so I can see why he might have said, ""I'm done."" But even he kept making records. CNN: Were you a Michael Jackson fan growing up? Did you moonwalk as a kid? Aldean: Of course! I had my glove and everything. Used to wet my hair so it looked like a Jheri curl. (Cracks up) CNN: Who else did you listen to as a kid? Aldean: Guns N' Roses -- the '80s rock stuff. Then I was into John Mellencamp, and Bob Seger and a lot of the Southern rock stuff -- the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Marshall Tucker Band. I listened to a lot of different kinds of music. CNN: Are you finding that the economy has affected ticket sales? Is it harder to sell out shows these days? Aldean: I think everybody has kind of seen a little bit of a hit. We're no different. We've tried to make it more affordable for people to come to a show with lower ticket prices [most of the time in the $20-40 range]. Maybe go in and play a show for less money than we would normally go in to play a show for, just so people can afford to come out and buy a ticket. I mean, you're looking at 200 bucks if you've got a wife and two kids -- and then by the time you come there and buy a couple of T-shirts, or some drinks or whatever, you're spending three, four hundred dollars, and right now, people are a little hesitant to do that. CNN: What do you consider an expensive ticket? Aldean: If Elvis was still around, I don't know if I'd pay 80 bucks to go see him. I surely would not pay 80 bucks to go see me! CNN: From a financial standpoint, touring is more important to an artist than selling records these days. Aldean: The music industry is so different now than it was even when I hit the scene in 2005. If you go to Wal-Mart and you want a song, you've got to buy the whole album for ten bucks -- or you can go to iTunes, and if you want a song, you can pay a dollar to get it. So in return, the record label is going to make less money, which is us making less money to pay them back. The way it works is the record label basically fronts the money for us to record an album. As the money comes back in off of that, they take that and repay the debt that we owe them. So if they're not making enough to repay that debt, they're not going to keep us employed on the label for very long. CNN: As an artist, do you worry about that? Aldean: Oh, absolutely. I think every artist worries about that. As a consumer, I think iTunes is a great thing. As an entertainer, not so much. I would much rather have somebody buy an album as a whole. Bad thing about purchasing singles -- if you have an artist you like and you keep doing that, there's not going to be music enough for you to go and get, because they're not going to have a deal anymore. But who knows? Record labels may one day be out all together, and people may be making their own music and selling it on their Web sites. CNN: That seems to benefit established artists more than up-and-coming ones. Aldean: Radio's really accepted us, and proven that they're really going to play my stuff as long as I give them something good to play. Fans are coming out to the show, so I mean what more could I ask for? My original plan when I got started in this deal was just to be able to make a good living for my family and play music. I've been able to do that, which is all I've ever wanted.",0.74478513,2581
34,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Mary J. Blige has sung her way to nine Grammy Awards and sold 40 million albums worldwide. ""I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting,"" Mary J. Blige said. With music credentials like that, the ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" needed a new challenge. So Blige decided to stretch her range to the big screen. The singer stars in the new Tyler Perry film ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" alongside Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson, Perry and Gladys Knight. Being in the film allows Blige to test her acting chops and sing as well. Her character, Tanya, is a club owner who takes the mic at least twice in the film. And whether she's in character or not, Blige's ability to communicate a song can take your breath away. CNN spoke with Blige about Tyler Perry, her acting angst and music. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: What does the title of the film ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" mean? Mary J. Blige: Well, the title ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" is basically saying ""I don't need anyone to help me do worse or feel worse than what I already feel."" So if you're coming with negative energy, please keep it moving, you know? If you're coming with negative deposits, you've gotta go. That's basically what it's saying. CNN: Were you nervous about acting in this film? Blige: I was definitely nervous, because acting is not my first profession, so I had to go and get an acting coach and really figure this thing out. It helped a lot. It relaxed me to have a little more information about it. And I find that actors are highly underrated; they don't get all the credit they deserve, because this is a hard job. That's a hard job. CNN: Were you bitten by the acting bug? Blige: Well, I'm gonna be open to scripts, and I'm ready to receive more scripts from anywhere. I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting. I was definitely bitten by the acting bug. CNN: Did you feel any pressure to write songs for this film, as opposed to writing for one of your albums? Blige: There's not any pressure in writing songs. Writing a song for the movie versus writing songs for my album because ... you get it all from inspiration from somewhere, you know? I got all the lyrics from the actual movie, and I got all the lyrics for my songs from my life so, and other people's lives. CNN: Do you want to hear poetry in your lyrics? Blige: I would love to hear poetry in my lyrics. CNN: Tell me about Tyler Perry. Blige: Wow, working with Tyler Perry was -- it's always a treat. He's the most kind, generous, you know, supportive professional man. He's a really good person to have in such a tough business. It's like a pillow for your head. ... You just get to lay on it after laying on rocks for so long. CNN: What is the link between spirituality and music in the film and in life? Blige: Well, I think the link with the spirituality and the music is that we all have a place where we need to go to heal, and most of the time people go to music to heal. Whether it be gospel or secular, but it all comes from some song that pulled you through your life or helped you through college or something like that. CNN: Do you think this film is about redemption? Do you think people can really change? Blige: I definitely feel this film is a lot about redemption. You saving yourself first of all, and believing you can be saved and wanting the help. I think it takes time for people to heal from whatever wounds they're healing from. But in order to get free, what I learned is that you have to release it, because you'll stay stuck for the rest of your life. What if this person is enjoying their lives and you hate them? So it's just best to release. Easier said than done, please believe it. CNN: What do you think about the music industry these days? Blige: Well, I mean, the music industry has moved with the times. You know, I mean we are in the age where technology has taken over and  music is technology now, so it's not hands-on. It's a little sad that there isn't any more record stores.",0.73607564,6184
36,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- If a kewpie doll sang in a band and had two kids, she'd be Gwen Stefani. Gwen Stefani was ready to get back with No Doubt after two solo albums and an active home life. The pop star and style icon turns 40 this fall, but she still uses words like ""you know"" and ""like"" at least five times a minute. That's part of Stefani's charm, and her carefree teenybopper mentality is one of the many reasons fans are excited about her first tour with No Doubt in half a decade. It's been 14 years since the quartet busted out of Orange County, California, with its signature sound of sunny, ska-influenced pop. In 2004, No Doubt went on hiatus as Stefani launched the first of two successful solo albums. In the meantime, drummer Adrian Young and guitarist Tom Dumont worked on side projects and watched their families grow. Stefani and her husband -- former Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale -- welcomed two sons, while bassist Tony Kanal is the only member to remain single and child-free. No Doubt is currently in the midst of a 53-date North American tour, for which they've dusted off such classic hits as ""Just a Girl,"" ""Spiderwebs"" and ""Bathwater."" Each member now travels in their own individual tour bus -- a must for an entourage that includes kids, toys and nannies.  Watch No Doubt in concert, at rest » . CNN: You'd hear rumors every once in a while that you guys were breaking up, or had broken up. Were those annoying, or did you kind of roll your eyes and say, ""That's part of the game?"" Adrian Young: I think we expected it. And there might even be some people that will think that we broke up, and that this is a reunion tour -- and it's just not the truth. We went 17 straight years without stopping, and we started having families, and we were burnt and we needed to do our own thing for a while. CNN: What was it like to get all four of you together in a room again? Tom Dumont: It's kind of like an old glove. It just fits. Young: Like an O.J. glove? Dumont: No, no, no. I know it's a weird analogy, but in the sense of -- you know, it fits. Tony Kanal: You know when somebody says ""glove"" now, you immediately think of O.J. Young: ""If it fits, you must acquit."" That's our band motto now. Dumont: We're not going to quit. We're just great old friends. It's almost like we're brothers and sister, and it's great to be having fun together again. Young: I feel more like we're married. CNN: I hear it's a little bit different this time. Instead of sharing a tour bus, you'll each have your own individual buses. Kanal: This will be our first time on separate buses, only out of necessity. Everyone's bringing their family. CNN: Are you just trying to get away from the kids, is that what you're saying, Tony?! Kanal: No, no, no! I would love to be on the bus with them. Gwen Stefani: Tony's going to be making kids on his bus. Kanal: Yeah, maybe my girlfriend and I will be in the process of starting our family. Stefani, Young and CNN (in unison): Really?! Kanal (ignoring everybody's reaction): But by default, I'm putting a studio on my bus. Because I don't have a crib on my bus -- they have cribs on their buses -- I'm putting a studio on my bus so we can keep writing if the inspiration comes, and we feel like doing it. Stefani: We're just putting the studio out there so we can pretend we might go out there and write songs, but we're really just going to have fun. ... We like writing songs, as well [but] I have to tell you, it's a very tortured process. There is nothing more rewarding when you know you've written a hit, and you know this magic happened. CNN: Did you guys really go to group therapy? Kanal: No. ... We had some self-imposed therapy sessions where we were trying to write music, and we were sitting in the room together, and a lot of stuff came out, and you know, it was kind of an emotional venting. We got rid of a lot of stuff. It was good. Stefani: We spent a lot of time together in the last 12 months. Right when I came off tour (from her second solo album, ""The Sweet Escape""), we started to write, and I was pregnant (with her second son, Zuma), and we did a lot of eating, a lot of chatting -- and then we had this magic 15 minutes from 4:45 to 5 o'clock where music would actually come out for a minute. One day, I was like, ""Argh! I'm in this room still! Let's go on tour!"" And everyone was like, ""OK!"" It was very spontaneous, and it's all kind of geared towards getting out there ... and getting inspired, and hopefully coming out of the other side and making an album. CNN: Gwen, when you were off doing the two solo albums, did you feel guilty at all? Because I know you all were trying to get back together for a couple of years. Stefani: I'm one of those people that I have to follow the inspiration when it strikes. ... These guys are just very supportive. We've been together forever -- forever, forever -- since we were kids, and this is just the one time in our lives we've had a break from each other. Everybody did their own thing. And I think all of us doing our own thing makes us even more grateful for each other, and kind of definitely not taking each other for granted -- not that we ever did before. ... But it's even more intense right now. CNN: Things have changed since the last time No Doubt was on the road, and there a lot of people who don't have that disposable income to spend on tickets for concerts. Young: One of the things we did for this tour for some of the venues is we have $10 lawn tickets for people that maybe want to come to the show, but they're strapped -- and we've never done that before as No Doubt, and it feels really good to do that. CNN: I was calling this a reunion. Was that bad? Stefani: We don't really care. We're just so happy that people want to come out and see the show, whatever they want to call it. We're just happy that people still are even talking about it. ... Even if you didn't really like our songs, or you had this kind of idea about us, come see us live, and we'll slap you around. You might have some fun, you know.",0.73231405,5062
37,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- When singer-pianist Peter Cincotti showed up to speak to CNN in 2004, he was fresh-faced and impeccably dressed in a suit and shiny shoes. Peter Cincotti rose to fame as a jazz pianist. His new album features pop songs. Seated at a piano, and under the watchful eye of his very sweet mother Cynthia, Cincotti performed the standard ""How High the Moon,"" showing off piano skills you'd expect from someone far beyond his 21 years. His debut album had just topped the Billboard traditional jazz chart -- the youngest artist to claim such a feat. Now 25, Cincotti is still fresh-faced, but he sings to a very different tune. Looking trendy in a fitted sweater, his hair a little looser, his personality more playful -- mom didn't come to this interview -- Peter has gone pop. ""He's this great jazz pianist,"" says producer David Foster, who worked on Cincotti's new album. ""And he just turned the whole thing 180 and wrote these incredible pop songs."" To Cincotti, whose pop debut ""East of Angel Town"" was released last week on Warner Bros. Records, the switch isn't that big a deal. ""I'm a musician,"" he says. ""I was just playing what I love then, and I'm playing what I love now.""  Watch Cincotti do what he loves » . Enlisting Foster to help navigate the transition was crafty: Foster is a 15-time Grammy winner with an undeniable knack for generating pop hits. He also has a reputation for getting his way in the studio. But Cincotti, a native New Yorker, didn't make things easy. ""He's a control freak, too, so we butted heads a lot,"" says Foster. ""And he actually made me come to New York to make the record. And I don't like New York because I'm claustrophobic and I don't dig elevators. But he made me come here for three months. That's how much I loved his music."" Cincotti smiles when he recalls the expletive-ridden voicemail message Foster left him expressing his displeasure over having to vacate his Los Angeles base to work on the project. ""I saved that message,"" Cincotti says. ""It's great."" Cincotti talked to CNN about new beginnings, old influences and playing piano in the fast lane. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What do you love about pop? Peter Cincotti: To be honest I don't even categorize (my music) as that. It's just what I'm doing now. This is my first record that I've written everything. It's my first record of original material so the style changed and that's basically what I'm doing right now. CNN: When a 25-year-old is writing songs, what experiences are you drawing on? Cincotti: Well, this record is ... kind of like a debut, and I wanted to write about things that I never sang about before in songs. Things that either happened to me, personal experiences. And I didn't want to write a record of ""I love you and you love me."" So a lot of the subject matter I think is a bit atypical of what's out there right now ... at least to me. CNN: You've been playing the piano since you were how old? Cincotti: I started when I was 3. My grandma bought me this ten-key toy piano, and she taught me how to play ""Happy Birthday."" It was my third birthday, and I sat down and I never stopped. CNN: Which pianists have inspired you over the years? Cincotti: There are so many. I'm still going through phases. I'll just listen to a certain musician. The first guy I remember ... I got my first cassette ... it was a Jerry Lee Lewis tape. I remember I was 5 years old and I went with my uncle to the record store. And I always liked ""Great Balls of Fire"" ... and I just couldn't stop trying to play like Jerry Lee Lewis. So he was the first piano player guy that really got under my skin. And then that led to many others ... piano players like Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel. From Art Tatum to Shirley Horne ... CNN: Jerry Lee Lewis played fast. Do you like to play fast? Cincotti: Back then I did. Back then I was fascinated. The faster the better. Now, if it's called for, sure. CNN: What was it like working with David Foster? Cincotti: It was great. He was a pain in the ass! In a good way. And I was a pain in the ass back to him. But I love working with him. There was no BS. It was just a very honest relationship. And I went through a period of taking my time figuring out what kind of producer I wanted for this record, and when he and I met ... we said ""let's just do one song together and see if it works out."" I was honored that he was interested, but at the same time I wanted the record to be right for what the vision was. But we got together and did 11 songs in three days. And it was one of those things that just clicked and happened. I couldn't imagine doing it with anyone else. CNN: What do you have against Los Angeles? Cincotti: I don't know if I have anything against it, but I'd rather spend my time elsewhere. CNN: Like New York? Cincotti: Like New York. CNN: You're a New Yorker through and through aren't you? Cincotti: I guess so (laughs).",0.72987765,2318
38,"(CNN) -- Kimberley Locke knows a thing or two about singing competitions. ""American Idol"" finalist Kimberley Locke is the new co-host of ""Gospel Dream."" Having placed third during season two of ""American Idol"" -- just behind winner Ruben Studdard and runner-up Clay Aiken -- the singer is back in reality show action as the new co-host of ""Gospel Dream."" The Gospel Music Channel's talent search is going into its fourth season, and Locke joins fellow host Mike Kasem (son of Casey Kasem) and the judges -- gospel artist J. Moss, Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams and industry executive Mitchell Solarek -- on the show. Locke has worked steadily since she first burst onto the ""Idol"" scene in 2003. She has modeled, served as a spokesperson for plus-sized clothier Lane Bryant and Jenny Craig and appeared on VH1's ""Celebrity Fit Club."" All the while, she has continued to pursue her music. Her ""8th World Wonder"" was a big hit, making the Top 10 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary charts. She's had three dance chart No. 1s. Locke recently spoke with CNN about the ""Gospel Dream,"" life after ""American Idol"" and the one reality show she really wants to appear on next. CNN: How did you get involved with ""Gospel Dream?"" Kimberley Locke: Funny enough, I've been wanting to do more hosting, and I had been talking to my manager about it. They contacted me out of the blue, and I was like ""Oh, I put it out to the universe, and here it is."" CNN: Are you a gospel music fan? Locke: I am a gospel music fan. Of course I grew up in the church singing gospel music. I don't listen to as much as I used to, but I used to sing in a girl a cappella group and that's how we started, performing in church. CNN: Why do you think so many performers in the music industry come out of the church? Locke: I think a lot of people become stars in their church. ... The church environment is so supportive. When you are first starting out and learning how to sing in front of an audience, that's the kind of audience you want to be in front of. Even if you mess up and you sound horrible, they kind of let you stand there and collect yourself while the pianist keeps playing. Then they plow through it with you. That's a part of the business, a professionalism that really comes in handy when you get to this level. CNN: You've had some experiences with singing competitions. How is ""Gospel Dream"" different? Locke: It's different in that the contestants are very focused on where they want to be and the type of music they want to sing. When you are on ""Idol,"" you are forced to fit into all of these different genres you may or may not want to do and you may or may not even be familiar with them. The ""Gospel Dream"" contestants' direction is really clear and defined, so they are picking songs that really speak to them on a personal level.  Watch Locke talk about the show » . CNN: How has life been for you post-""Idol?"" Locke: Life has been great post-""Idol."" So many opportunities, so many things I would have never imagined. Things that I didn't even associate with singing, like modeling, hosting, being a spokesperson, owning a restaurant. It just opened so many doors. CNN: You were a plus-sized model and spokesperson for Lane Bryant, but now you are way too small to do that. Locke: That really opened me up to bond with my fans. I tell people I'm still a big girl at heart. CNN: When is your next album coming out? Locke: I just started working on the next album. We are in the very preliminary stages of putting together the concept of the record and we just compiled a bunch of songs to start listening to. CNN: Are you planning on doing any other reality shows? Locke: I'm not really a big reality show fan. I did ""Celebrity Fit Club"" because there was a purpose behind that in my wanting to lose weight. There is only one reality show I really, really want to do, and that's ""Dancing With the Stars."" I want to be on that show because then I'd lose the extra 10 to 15 pounds I want to lose.",0.72987044,8817
40,"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago, America discovered ""one of England's loudest bands,"" courtesy of documentarian Marty DiBergi and his film, ""This Is Spinal Tap."" Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer will perform Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs on tour. It was all parody -- DiBergi was director Rob Reiner, and cohorts Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer played the heavy-metal musicians in Spinal Tap -- but for a fictional band, Spinal Tap has had a long afterlife. The film gave birth to several catchphrases, including one -- ""up to 11"" -- that's made it into the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. There are Web sites devoted to the Tap, including at least one, http://tap-albums.s5.com/, that offers a complete discography of the fictional band's nonexistent albums. And Guest, McKean and Shearer have never left their spandexed alter egos behind. The band reunited for a 1992 album, ""Break Like the Wind,"" and again for a 2001 tour. For the latter, the opening act was another Guest-McKean-Shearer collaboration, the Folksmen from Guest's film ""A Mighty Wind."" Now Shearer, McKean and Guest are hitting the road again, but not as Spinal Tap or the Folksmen. They're playing ... themselves. ""We're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us, and only us,"" says Shearer in a phone interview discussing the trio's ""Unwigged & Unplugged"" 30-date acoustic tour, which kicks off Friday in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""And because we don't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we're trying to dress it up as a treat, a rare treat, to see us as ourselves."" The group will be performing both Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs, though, Shearer adds, ""[we'll be] doing these songs kind of in a different way because we're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters."" Have no fear, however, Tap fans: A new album, ""Back from the Dead,"" is due out in June. Shearer took some time out from tour preparations to talk about Spinal Tap's origins, the similarities between Tap and Metallica, and how ""Start Me Up"" became more closely identified with the Folksmen than the Rolling Stones. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: It's been 25 years since ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" but it's been much longer since Spinal Tap came together. Do you remember what brought it about -- and who it's based on? Shearer: You know, I would like to make a little book composed of all the bands that people have guessed Spinal Tap actually is -- there would be a lot of bands in there. And in fact it is about a lot of bands -- it's never been about one band. When we did this, the Pythons had already done [the Beatles parody] the Rutles, so there had been a piece that ... was a really specific spoof of a really specific band. That was something we didn't want to do -- that had been done. Our notion was to ... sort of encapsulate everything we know about rock 'n' roll -- and everything we found funny or amusing about bands -- into one band. So it was a process of smooshing all that stuff into this fictional band. CNN: Are you familiar about this new movie called ""Anvil""? [The documentary, about a real heavy-metal band, has been compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap.""] . Shearer: I've been reading about it and hearing about it a lot, but I haven't seen it. ... It sounds interesting. The last thing I've seen along that line was ""Some Kind of Monster."" ... Was that amazing. That was stupefying. ... I heard they had a therapist. But it wasn't really a therapist -- it was a life coach. Which is different -- and worse (laughs). Even more humiliating. It's one thing to have somebody who's a therapist, but ... did you ever see ""Starting Over""? The daytime series on NBC? CNN: No. Shearer: Oh, four or five women in a house with two life coaches. Oh my God, it was just shocking. Well, ""Some Kind of Monster"" is in that vein. CNN: How do you guys go about writing songs? The songs on the first album were wonderful pastiches of various heavy metal-type things. On the second album you had more styles and brought in guest musicians, including [renowned session pianist] Nicky Hopkins for ""Rainy Day Sun."" Shearer: My God, yeah. Nicky had actually come in, I think, to audition for the movie but couldn't do the movie or something, but we'd always dreamed to work with Nicky. How we write the songs -- ... every one is a different experience. In the case of Tap, it's what seems like a funny idea sort of leads to a riff or some lyrics. In the case of the Folksmen, I think there was more -- at least the stuff Michael and I wrote together -- a sense these certain kinds of songs that became clichés in that era of folk music, and we sort of have to touch each of these bases. CNN: Like ""Blood on the Coal,"" a combination of coal mining and train song. Shearer: Yeah! We saved you the time. It was a twofer. ... There were a lot of songs in that era that were kind of based loosely or less loosely on the Bible, so we wrote ""The Good Book Song,"" and then of course the great cliché of folk music is the rambler or wandering song, so we wrote ""Never Did No Wanderin',"" about a guy who just stayed home. CNN: Since you're going to be performing as you, are you worried that people will show up wondering where the costumes are, or perhaps yell out, ""Hey Harry, I want to hear Smithers,"" or ""Hey Chris, do Harlan Pepper""? Shearer: Each seat will be [affixed] with Taser equipment to discourage that. ... Hopefully, we'll be so entrancing that they won't be even thinking of talking to us, except if we ask for questions. But as to what people are expecting, we're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us, and only us, and because we don't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we're trying to dress it up as a treat, a rare treat, to see us as ourselves and doing these songs kind of in a different way, because we're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters. CNN: Are you planning to do covers on the order of ""Start Me Up""? [The Folksmen covered the Rolling Stones song on the ""Mighty Wind"" soundtrack.] . Shearer: ""Start Me Up"" is actually the only song that we didn't write that's in the show. I can't resist [it] -- none of us can -- but I have a personal affection for it. After the Super Bowl a few years ago in Detroit, where the Stones played halftime, a few weeks later I met somebody who said that ""the soundtrack record of 'A Mighty Wind' is my 6-year-old son's favorite CD, and at the Super Bowl that day during halftime, I was in the kitchen making lunch for him and his sister, and the 6-year-old ran into the kitchen as excited as I'd ever seen him in his life and said, 'Daddy daddy daddy, they're doing a Folksmen song on the Super Bowl!'

41,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- ""Late Show With David Letterman"" bandleader Paul Shaffer is a walking Wikipedia of rock 'n' roll history -- and now he's added his own story to the mix. Paul Shaffer has been David Letterman's bandleader for 27 years. Shaffer's new memoir, ""We'll Be Here for the Rest of Our Lives: A Swingin' Showbiz Saga"" (Flying Dolphin Press) offers his take on a colorful career, from piano lessons in his native Canada to a ""Saturday Night Live"" stint to the gig he's had, and relished, for 27 years -- Letterman's sidekick. Oh yeah, and he co-wrote the hit disco song ""It's Raining Men."" Shaffer appeared this week at a Manhattan Barnes & Noble to sign books and give a performance. Among those who dropped by were the Beach Boys' Al Jardine -- who joined in for ""Help Me, Rhonda"" -- Martin Short and girl group belter Darlene Love. Shaffer also took questions from the audience. Though the topic of Letterman's recent troubles was off-limits, one audience member did ask Shaffer what the host was really like -- emphasis on ""really."" Shaffer responded that the boss he's respected and admired for nearly three decades is ""very transparent on the air and you can see exactly what he's like."" Shaffer talked to CNN about how he picks songs to introduce guests, his renowned Passover celebrations and his chance to be on ""Seinfeld."" The following is an edited version of the interview: . CNN: When guests are introduced on the ""Late Show,"" you usually add a musical accompaniment that's an obscure reference to their name. My favorite was when Dustin Hoffman was a guest, and you played ""Dust in the Wind."" Can you tell me how you come up with those, and what some of your favorites have been? Paul Shaffer: We think of them in rehearsal before the show. I have about 15 minutes, and I often throw it open to the floor. And by the floor, I mean the musicians, the band [the ""Late Show's"" CBS Orchestra members]. And I say ""Who has an idea for this?"" And I pick the one that I like the best. [Once we] had a new actor named Aziz Ansari, and one of the guys in the band says, ""I'm Sorry"" [referring to the Brenda Lee song]. So we did it, and it cracked Dave [Letterman] up so I know that I got my one laugh -- and the most important laugh. CNN: What's the story behind using Ray Charles' ""Busted"" for Tom Brokaw? Shaffer: He was particularly difficult to come up with something for because he's on all the time, and we didn't want to play a news theme or a song about the news. So Will Lee, my bass player, suggested ""Busted"" ... ""I'm broke, aw -- I'm busted."" And Brokaw asked about it once: ""Why do you play Ray Charles' 'Busted' when I come on?"" He asked on camera, and I said, ""I'm broke -- aw -- I'm busted."" CNN: What is your favorite song of all time? Shaffer: As far as favorite ""overall package"" record of all time, I'd have to say ""My Girl"" by The Temptations. I like everything about it, not only the composition -- but the arrangement, the production, the lead vocals, the background vocals, the horns, the strings. That one I listen to over and over again. And, of course, ""Be My Baby"" by the Ronettes. Maybe that's my favorite song, and ""My Girl"" is my favorite record. CNN: For some reason I thought it was ""He's a Rebel"" by the Crystals. Shaffer: Well that's way up there. I consider that my national anthem. When I hear ""He's a Rebel,"" I stand. CNN: Are there any musicians you regret never having had a chance to work with? Shaffer: Well, of course, Frank [Sinatra] is one, and Elvis is the other. But aside from those two I think I've done pretty well. CNN: Can you tell me a little bit about your famed ""Celebrity Seders""? Shaffer: We spent a lot of time at the show during the early days of ""SNL"" [""Saturday Night Live""]. We had no personal lives at all. ... And, of course, we were there doing a show around Passover time, and Suzanne Miller, who was one of the writers, came up with the idea that we should have a seder for the cast and crew and writers who wouldn't be going home. So I said, ""I can conduct it!"" I knew how to conduct a seder at lightning speed because my parents couldn't wait to get to the matzo ball soup. So I have that skill, and I also sort of had an act, too. As a prize for finding the matzo, I gave out a pizza on [""SNL's""] ""Weekend Update."" [Producer] Lorne Michaels liked it so much that he had matches printed up immediately that said ""Paul Shaffer's Celebrity Seder"" and that became legendary. CNN: In the late 1980s, you were offered the role of George Costanza on ""Seinfeld."" Any regrets on not accepting that part? Shaffer: Just to be clear, I was offered the role of Jerry Seinfeld's sidekick. He had three sidekicks, and I had a feeling mine might've been that role. And any regrets? Well, I mean it was only the most beloved show of all time. ... Truthfully, though, I would have missed the opportunity to play music. CNN: How do you stay hip and current in a world where today's kids don't appreciate showbiz legends and the origins of comedy? Shaffer: I still talk incessantly about ""SCTV,"" and I say, ""Screw the kids!""",0.7245625,6908
42,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Watching the Dave Matthews Band moments before they take the stage is like watching a football team bursting out of the locker room before a big game. Dave Matthews says he bellieves strongly in the power of community. They slap hands. Bump fists. Jump up and down, exclaiming ""Feel the love, feel the love!"" The energy in the air is electric. And when they walk out on stage, the energy explodes into thousands of shining faces. People dance in the aisles. Others sing every word to every song. A few share funny cigarettes. For more than three hours, the jubilant atmosphere creates a sense of community between an amphitheater filled with strangers and the ethnically diverse musicians leading the charge on stage. But then DMB is all about community -- creating its own and giving back. BAMA Works Fund -- the group's charitable foundation -- has handed out $5 million in grants to worthy causes, including schools and victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Watch Matthews sound off on the album -- and racism » . And despite the unexpected passing of saxophonist LeRoi Moore due to complications from an ATV accident last summer, the band members seem to be recharged. In June, DMB notched its fifth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard chart with ""Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King."" We caught up with Matthews just as news hit the Web that former President Jimmy Carter believed racism was the root of some of the negativity directed toward President Obama in recent weeks. The 42-year-old singer-songwriter offered a unique perspective, as a man who split his childhood between the United States and South Africa during apartheid. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: President Carter said he thinks that a lot of the animosity directed toward President Obama is race related. Dave Matthews: Of course it is! I found there's a fairly blatant racism in America that's already there, and I don't think I noticed it when I lived here as a kid. But when I went back to South Africa, and then it's sort of thrust in your face, and then came back here -- I just see it everywhere. There's a good population of people in this country that are terrified of the president only because he's black, even if they don't say it. And I think a lot of them, behind closed doors, do say it. Maybe I'm paranoid about it, but I don't think someone who disagreed as strongly as they do with Obama -- if it was Clinton -- would have stood up and screamed at him during his speech. (Shakes his head) I don't think so. CNN: Everything has gone to such a frenzied pitch. Matthews: I think a lot of it has to be on the press. We give the podium to a lot of people who shouldn't have the podium. The message that's delivered the loudest and in the most entertaining way is the one that we're going to put on because that's what we want. We want ratings more than we want to deliver information. That's just where the culture's gotten. There's no way that Walter Cronkite, as a young journalist, no way Ed Murrow would be hired to do news today. Not a chance. CNN: Because they're too low-key? Because they're not bombastic? Matthews: Because they're thoughtful, and they're patient, and they're tying to tell you a truly balanced story. They're trying to impart information. I don't think that's the goal [now] because it's not a good business plan. ... Everyone's outraged all the time. Why are you outraged? There's war -- there's always been war, as long as most of us have been alive. There have always been people being abused, there's always been horrible things in the world. Why are we outraged? We should just be quiet and figure it out, and work it out together. ... There's no solution in Washington as long as people are shouting like that. CNN: Before you went on stage at the Greek Theatre (in Los Angeles), we were talking to the crew -- and they couldn't wait to tell us how well they're treated by the Dave Matthews organization. ... It's like your own minicommunity out there. You even print your own tickets, right? Matthews: We have kept everything in-house. The core crew guys are the same guys we had when we were driving in a van, so they can always call ""bull"" on us if we start acting like prima donnas. It keeps a sense of community going when you travel a lot. There's a good vibe. ... I have friends who are famous, and friends that are not famous -- but there are those who stick out to me. Willie Nelson is one -- a really genuine person -- or Neil Young. Adam Sandler ... people who really try and keep a sense of unity, and camaraderie and equality around them. That's essential. That's it for me. I don't think socialism, and I don't think warmness and respect are necessarily bad words. CNN: Do you think you're competitive? A perfectionist? Matthews: I'm a very vicious critic of myself. CNN: So what do you think of this record (""Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King"")? Matthews: I think that's a really good record. (Laugh) Our first three records were really good. We made good records after those first three -- really good records -- but I don't think they were necessarily the spirit of the band. I think this is the greatest record that we've ever made, and it captures the band like none of our records have. ... CNN: Before this album, weren't you burned out a little bit? Matthews: I insisted upon taking as much time to make this as I needed. And my manager would call -- my manager who I love, who's a dear friend of mine -- he'd call and say, ""Are you going to have it finished by the summer?"" ""No."" ""Are you going to have it finished by Christmas?"" ""No."" I practiced ""no."" I need to work on ""no"" still, but I got better at it. CNN: What other tricks do you have up your sleeve? Matthews: I want to figure out a way to not be stupid with money, then make a whole bunch of it, then I want to move to Outer Mongolia. I want to milk a yak. Maybe I'll just settle for a cow. Can you milk a bison? I have fantasies about being a farmer. I always wanted to be a fireman, but who didn't want to be a fireman? I just wouldn't tell anyone. I'd just go ""poof!"" Sometimes I like that idea. CNN: You don't tell people about a lot of things you do. There's no press release that goes out saying, ""Dave Matthews Band just donated $5 million to this cause or that cause."" Matthews: We definitely use our fame and our celebrity to raise money for things we care about. ... What a luxury to be able to just do a show, and then look -- pow! ... I don't want to become a poster child. That's a whole different thing. I don't want to be the face on it.",0.72433597,7582
43,"(CNN) -- You can't get through a conversation with Jesse Dayton without hearing a reference to Texas at least once. Musician Jesse Dayton has branched out to a new fanbase by collaborating with Rob Zombie. He wears the name Beaumont, his birthplace, like a badge of honor and he rolls through a set list of stories about his musical collaborations in the Lone Star state with humble pride. Dayton has earned a hard core following in Texas. But his recent collaborations with rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie have earned him an unexpected fan base -- among horror movie fans. Most recently, Dayton joined Zombie to record a soundtrack for the movie ""Halloween II"" as Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures -- a gig that also earned him some time on screen.  Watch Dayton discuss his new project » . Dayton spoke to CNN recently about his career and newfound fan base. The following is a portion of that interview: . CNN: You have a lot of appreciation for Waylon Jennings. Dayton: I was actually on a talk show in Nashville [Tennessee] and Waylon was cooking with his wife, Jessi Colter. They were watching the show I was on because Kris Kristofferson was on. They saw me and called me the next morning and said, ""Waylon cut his finger. He wants you to come down here."" So it was a total fluke. Waylon was like my Elvis, especially growing up. My earliest memories were my mom's 8-track in the parlor listening to Willie [Nelson] and Waylon. CNN: You are not really part of the Nashville music scene. Why? Dayton: I'm not intentionally staying away from what's going on in Nashville. I'm just being myself. Texas is like a whole other planet. Bob Wills got kicked off the Grand Ole Opry. Willie Nelson didn't get on the radio until he left Nashville. There's a long history of that. I don't put down Nashville. They're just doing what they're supposed to do, which is sell as many records as they can. But we've just learned that there's a whole crowd of people out there that love Johnny Cash but aren't into what they're playing on country radio. That's been the crowd we're attracting. The cool thing we love about having a cult following is that radio and record companies can never take that away from us. It's something we went out and earned one fan at a time. I love looking out in the crowd and seeing one guy with a cowboy hat on, one guy with long hair from the Rob Zombie camp and maybe some rockabilly kids. CNN: What is the story behind your collaboration with Rob Zombie in 2005? Dayton: He said, ""Hey man, we're making the ultimate white trash horror movie called 'The Devil's Rejects.' We think your music would be perfect for it"" which is kind of a left-handed compliment, I guess. CNN: Now you're appearing in ""Halloween II"" and recorded a soundtrack for the movie? Dayton: It's really fun for me. We're taking on this whole identity of this band. The record's going to be called ""Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures."" [Zombie] would call me and say, ""Hey, I got this idea for this song called 'Doctor Demon and the Robot Girl' "" or [he would ask me to write] a sort of '60s country thing-meets Tom Jones. CNN: Are you a good actor? Dayton: Elvis said, ""The only thing worse than seeing a bad movie is being in one."" I think the only thing worse than watching a bad actor is being one. I don't take it seriously at all. I'm just a musician who's there for color. If I can show up and be myself and not have to act? Perfect.",0.7215984,7757
44,"(CNN) -- Stewart Copeland and Sting get along great. Really. Stewart Copeland's background includes a wide range of musical influences, many of which emerged in the Police. OK, the Police's drummer and bassist may have argued from time to time. Perhaps even ferociously. And Copeland finds Sting's attempts to be a drum arranger annoying. OK, maybe infuriating. But, as he writes in his new book, ""Strange Things Happen"" (HarperStudio), ""We have discovered that we can be good friends -- as long as no one mentions music."" Besides, Copeland adds in an interview, both Sting and guitarist Andy Summers ""are crap at drums.""  Watch Copeland dish on the band » . Copeland may be best known for the hitmaking musical trio, but he hasn't let the Police define him. The son of a CIA officer, he grew up in the Middle East and has let his musical fascinations range widely. He's written operas and dozens of film and television scores and is currently working on a concerto for the Dallas Symphony. (He also plays polo.) Copeland took some time to talk about his relationship with the Police, the importance of percussion and the social niceties of West L.A. private schools. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: The pace of the book makes it seem like you've been living ""A Hard Day's Night"" for the last 30 or 35 years. Is it really that busy? Stewart Copeland: Oh, it's pretty busy, but if it wasn't busy, I'd be stressed and anxious. In fact, this week I've got some down time, and I'm looking at the walls. CNN: It's been inescapable that people are focusing on the part of the book involving you and your fellow Police members. You say that you have a great relationship with Sting until music gets involved. Copeland: We get along in every way until it comes to music. ... [But] both of them are crap at drums, so at least I don't have that to deal with. CNN: So Sting is not much of a drummer, despite the fact that he has all these ideas. Copeland: Actually, he can play a bit of drums, but he's much better arranging drums than playing them. And I think I'd rather have him as a drummer than as an arranger of drums, even though he's quite brilliant at [arranging]. CNN: Has there always been that friction in the band? Copeland: Yes. With Andy, there's no friction at all; we get along great. ... And by the way, he's not the man in the middle, either. He's not a mediator. He's his own little volcano. He's a very sharp point to the triangle. But this conflict ... when we did the reunion tour, it was like everything was different, but nothing had changed. From the first 16 bars, we were straight back into where we left off. CNN: With the Police, the friction seems -- for lack of a better term -- healthy. Copeland: Well, it's that musical dichotomy that makes the band what it is. If we didn't have those beautiful, sensitive songs, we'd be lost. Those beautiful, sensitive songs have an extra kick to them because there's a madman in the group. CNN: Does the madman change, or is it always Sting? Copeland: Actually, all three of us have our moments. CNN: You grew up in the Middle East. Do you see any reflections of that in the way you play the drums, in the way you feel the beat? Copeland: Absolutely. I grew up surrounded by Arabic music. The central element of Arabic music is the baladi rhythm, which is just Arabic for ""country."" And it has that drop on the three-beat. And it has that use of negative space. And it also has the very ornate use of the 16th notes, which are very expressive in Arabic music. And I suppose those are all factors that show up in the Police. CNN: You mentioned in the book that you put aside the sticks for many years until [Primus'] Les Claypool got you back into it. Copeland: Yes. The Police experience in the studio was so horrendous that my two colleagues actually managed temporarily to convince me that I had no talent and I was a menace to music. And I was distracted by composing. ... I wanted to play with all of those toys, and needed to shake off the rhythm label. And I think I was successful in doing that, to the detriment of my drumming career. CNN: Was picking up the sticks again like riding a bike? Copeland: Absolutely. The rhythm is still there. The pulse is still strong. The persnickety bits -- the finesse -- that took awhile to come back. CNN: You mention getting together with all-star bands with others -- Gene Simmons, Stephen Stills -- at your son's school. Is that common in L.A.? Copeland: Well, in Los Angeles in the west side here, there are three or four schools where all the alpha types send their kids. Between the three schools, we have all of the glitterati. CNN: Do you still find yourself a fan in those situations, seeing musicians you admire? Copeland: Not really. I'll get completely filled with fan fervor in listening to the music, but I've just learned so many times that the person is not the music. ... And also at these schools, everything is extremely downplayed. All of these alpha wives of these luminaries -- and the female luminaries themselves -- all go down to Gap especially to buy their school clothes. No bling, Gap clothing. It's all extremely dressed down and un-ostentatious. CNN: Is there a favorite or least favorite Police song you do? Do you get so that you think, ""If I have to play 'Roxanne' one more time ... "" Copeland: No, I still enjoy playing ""Roxanne."" ... Some songs are more of a mountain to climb physically, [like] ""When the World Is Running Down."" Andy takes a guitar solo that is so stratospheric, climbs so high and has such power, I get carried away. By the time he's finished, I am done. And I realize that I've just burnt every calorie, and I've got another 45 minutes of set to play. CNN: People don't realize how physically demanding it is. Copeland: But the thing is, when you're doing it, you're hardly aware of it as well, because you're sustained by 80,000 people freaking out. ... I don't want to get all metaphysical here or nothin', but something definitely happens. You are definitely empowered by the power of that huge audience. ... It pumps you up.",0.7210558,7239
45,"(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side. Nanci Griffith, who says she's ""fed up with negativity,"" was revitalized by the election of Barack Obama. And who could blame her? In the past decade, Griffith -- perhaps best known for her Grammy-winning 1993 album, ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" -- had faced a political climate she didn't agree with, as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer, which she was diagnosed with in the late '90s. Songwriting had become a struggle for the singer with the gentle, crystalline voice. ""It was ... horrific,"" she said simply. However, with her latest album, ""The Loving Kind"" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years. Sparked by the changes in her life and American politics, she said, music has been vital to her personal resurgence. ""It was nice to focus on things outside of my body. Music has always done that for me,"" she said. Describing herself as someone who was ""fed up with negativity,"" Griffith was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen. ""[The] American people will not let this country collapse,"" she said. The idea motivated her to look at her country's dark path of injustice not so long ago, stories that worked their way into her songwriting. ""In some ways, I'm just a journalist. I [want] my audience to hear these stories,"" she said. CNN spoke with Griffith from her home in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Being a folk singer and your views being what they are, was it tougher or maybe easier to write songs from 2000 to 2008? Nanci Griffith: It was very difficult for me. I was hurt by the direction my country was going in. And then, after [the 2008 election], everything came spilling out. Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case (""The Loving Kind""), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary. [The Lovings were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in Virginia at the time.] That was such an inspiration. ... Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage. Little things. Bit by bit, my heart started to open up again, and I could write! CNN: Had you ever gone through that before? Griffith: No, never in my life. I've always been a very prolific writer. CNN: Now, what about writing in the age of Obama? Griffith: (laughs) It feels great! People may be down on their luck, financially. But I see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [general] openness. CNN: Now, in addition to ""The Loving Kind,"" there are other songs based on actual events on this record. Tell me about ""Not Innocent Enough."" Griffith: That's based on Philip Workman's case in Memphis [Tennessee]. He was robbing a Wendy's -- was a heroin addict -- and police came in, and an officer was killed. Now, Workman didn't kill him; it was friendly fire. Workman was convicted anyway and executed. I'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty, but this case really stunned me, because I feel like this country has evolved enough to where we shouldn't have to live with the death penalty. CNN: Is it hard as a writer/musician to inhabit those songs, knowing that they are actual events? Griffith: Not really. I feel like, in some ways, I'm just a journalist. I don't express my opinion [in the songs], necessarily. But it's important to me that my audience hear these stories. I want as many people to know about Loving v. Virginia as possible. CNN: Do you feel like it's a more palatable way to become aware of a story like that when a song is attached to it? Griffith: I do. I've been informed many times through music. Pete Seeger, Odetta, Dave Van Ronk, Bruce Springsteen ... so many folk songwriters. It's all around you. CNN: The song ""Still Life"" -- I suspect that's about President George W. Bush? Griffith: It's about people like him. This country is full of them, and especially my home state of Texas. It's a [perspective on] people who go through life getting away with everything. CNN: Do you feel a sense of vindication with President Obama's election, or at least a sense that things are moving in a direction you're in favor of? Griffith: I hope so. Right now, he is my hero. So is his wife. CNN: What in your past steered you into a topical songwriter? Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me. CNN: Is there a different process of writing those topical songs versus a song like ""Up Against the Rain,"" which is clearly more personal? Griffith: There is a burden to writing [those topical songs]: You better have your facts straight. When you're writing a personal song like ""Rain,"" it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow. CNN: ""Sing"" seems like it would fit that description. Does that song sum up your life in a way? Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career. It's not something you choose. It's just what you do.",0.72021663,7969
46,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Brandon Boyd blends into his Venice, California, neighborhood like any other resident. Brandon Boyd, front man for Incubus, is going on the road with the band in July. He surfs. Shuns Starbucks in favor of the local smoothie shop. Walks his French bulldog, Bruce. Oh, he also paints and makes music with his multiplatinum rock band, Incubus. The quintet hits the road on a North American summer tour in July, and just released a greatest hits collection called ""Monuments and Melodies."" The packaging features artwork by Boyd, who held his first solo art exhibit at Mr. Musichead Rock Art Gallery in Los Angeles last fall. The showroom is on the Sunset Strip, a stone's throw from the clubs that were host to Incubus' first gigs. The most spectacular paintings are large, fantasy-inspired pieces drenched in burgundy or aqua. Usually, the artwork springs to life in a corner of the singer's kitchen, where an easel permanently resides. It's a zen-like space, with high ceilings, glossy concrete floors and warm, burnished wood. But instead of the requisite Buddha statue, there's a rubber rabbit's head for inspiration. The muse seems ironic and appropriate, especially since Boyd swears his home was a brothel back in the 1900s. CNN talked to Boyd about collaboration, the fulfillment of art and finding the perfect wave. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Isn't it ironic that you had your first solo art show before your first solo album? Brandon Boyd: I've actually thought very little about solo work up until just very recently. Most of it is because in my band, Incubus, it is very much a collaborative effort. I do what I do in the band, and everyone plays their respective parts, but in the end, we are sort of a democratic process. We meet in the middle for a lot of the songs, and I think that's why we sound the way we do -- because it's sort of five minds meeting in the middle. With my art thing, it's completely self-indulgent.  Watch the singer discuss his art » . CNN: So what does art fulfill in you that you don't get out of music? Boyd: To me, it's like the difference between a pen and a paintbrush. Music draws from almost the identical place as art does, which really is that intangible -- it's like you're pulling from the ether. I don't know where it comes from. Nobody really does. It sort of arrives when it wants to. ... I've been painting and drawing and taking pictures as long as I've been writing music -- and I've actually been drawing longer than I've been writing music. I didn't go around looking for it. It kind of found me. CNN: Your parents always encouraged you to explore your artistic side. Boyd: My parents are wonderful, and I'm really lucky -- but my mom has always been almost exclusively a right-brained person. She goes completely on her feelings of things, on her intuition, and so she instilled that in my brothers and I. And she also instilled in us from a very young age the importance of visualization -- visualization as a tool towards manifestation in your life. And so, from a very young age, if I didn't feel well, she's like, ""Well, draw what's happening and draw a solution."" If I had a stomach ache, I would draw a picture of my stomach, and I would draw what I thought the bad germs looked like -- and, you know, they had little robber masks on and stuff. And then I would draw a good germ, and of course it had a cape, and some tights, and he had a washcloth in his hands, and he could fly around and clean up the bad germs. And for some reason, I would always feel better afterwards. CNN: Did you ever visualize and draw what you wanted to achieve in terms of your music career, too? Boyd: Sometimes, yeah. But the guys in the band -- we kind of grew up together, and when they were like, ""We want to play music, let's start a band. You should be the singer,"" I was like, ""OK."" I'd never written anything before, I had never even really sang, but they knew that I knew how to draw, so it seemed logical that maybe I could write lyrics or carry a tune. So I always just sort of visualize lines, I would visualize a melody, and then sound it out to them, and they would help me sort of guide it through the instruments. And eventually, I got good enough at it that I was able to do it completely on my own. CNN: When you finish a painting, is it very much like finishing a song or finishing an album? Boyd: Yeah, there is definitely a sense of accomplishment. Very rarely is there any confusion as to when a painting or a song is finished. You just know when it's done. Someone wise once said when they were asked the question, ""How do you know when you're done with a painting?"" And they said, ""How do you know when you're done making love?"" I always thought that was a great analogy. CNN: Did you ever think, ""I need a fall-back job, like being an accountant, or a lawyer, or someone who works for IBM?"" Boyd: I feel very blessed, but no. I knew from a very young age that these were the things that I was supposed to do, and I actually made some very adult decisions when I was a teenager based on the knowledge that this is what I was going to do. There was really no question about it. CNN: What else do you want to do? Boyd: Painting and art are obviously in my focus, but I dream about getting a really big tube at the Bonsai Pipeline sometime in the near future.",0.7170951,7646
47,"(CNN) -- Todd Rundgren has it backward. Todd Rundgren's new album was inspired by touring and his thoughts on militarism. Not just his songwriting and recording methods, though those, too, are unorthodox. It's the whole music business-pop star arrangement, which is based on musicians determined to hit the Top 40 and then doing it again and again -- with occasional artistic detours -- that he's subverted. He likes it that way. He describes the creation of his music as ""very plastic,"" in the sense of flexible: He creates songs in the studio, piece by piece, and ""it allows me to edit the stuff practically all the way up to the final mix process."" One can easily look at his career the same way, with the detours having been the point of the journey. ""It's unconventional, but if you have those tools available, it becomes the logical way to do things,"" he said of his creative process. Rundgren's new album, ""Arena"" (Hi Fi), sounds like a throwback to his more song-friendly works, which was (mostly) deliberate, he says. The album's 13 power-chord rockers are a tip of the guitar to his recent touring with the New Cars (filling in for Ric Ocasek) and his subject matter, militarism and ""what I saw as a loss of masculine integrity,"" he explained. ""The people who have been running the country are liars and cowards and hypocrites and perverts,"" he said. ""And I wouldn't want all the rest of the men in the world to think that's how you succeed in life. Now that they are out of here, we have to ... reclaim what our traditional ideals were: You protect the weak, you bear up under the horrible burdens, and you seek the truth. ... You sacrifice for others."" Not exactly Top 40 material, but in Rundgren's career, it's the Top 40 hits that have been accidents. He started his solo career in the early '70s with a handful of them -- ""We Gotta Get You a Woman,"" ""Hello, It's Me,"" ""I Saw the Light"" -- but quickly began devoting his time to album-length experiments, with occasional hit-single forays (""Can We Still Be Friends,"" his band Utopia's ""Set Me Free""). Rundgren also became an in-demand producer, with results ranging from No. 1 singles (Grand Funk Railroad's ""We're an American Band"" and ""The Loco-Motion"") to classic albums (XTC's ""Skylarking,"" Meat Loaf's ""Bat Out of Hell""), no two of which sounded exactly alike.  Listen to Rundgren talk about his work with XTC and Grand Funk Railroad » . He says his goal is to bring out the best in whomever he's working with, to make a record that's true to the artist's personality. Ironically, for someone so steeped in technology, he's not a fan of using studio tricks -- AutoTune and the like, which remove all the rough edges from performances -- for the sake of creating something ""perfect."" ""Part of the problem is, there are two ways to make music. One is to be revelatory, and one is to be obfuscating,"" he said. ""You create a different image of yourself for people instead of actually revealing something truly about yourself. And you can say the difference is the difference between Michael Jackson and Tom Waits, or something like that. ... The material Madonna writes is to a persona. The persona is what's being marketed, and the music is just part of the merchandise."" Rundgren himself composes from the inside out, putting technology at his disposal. (He's often been ahead of the tech curve, going back to the late '70s, when he created music videos and software programs and Utopia played on the interactive television service QUBE.) ""I start with a rhythm idea and then add chords,"" he said, creating arrangements as he goes. Lyrics often come last. ""Most people have the song before the arrangement,"" he said. ""I do it the other way around."" On ""Arena,"" the songs -- which all have one-word titles (""I'm close to a haiku,"" Rundgren joked) -- include ""Mad,"" in which Rundgren sings about being ""at the end of my patience""; ""Gun,"" which offers the warning, ""You better run/'Cause I'm young, dumb and I've got a gun""; and ""Today,"" which says, ""Now it's time to break the chain."" The work is timelier than he could have imagined, he says. ""The irony of it is that the album was finished by June 1; then the s*** hit the fan three months later,"" he said, referring to the economic meltdown. ""It's what I've been talking about. We've been indulging ourselves for a long time, and the record is about the kind of militance required to solve problems that tower so high we can't see the top of them."" For someone who writes such audience-friendly hooks, he's skeptical about much of today's pop music -- and its performers. The music may sound technically perfect, but it lacks soul and grit. ""That kind of approach is reinforced all the time by programs like 'American Idol,' where you have to look a certain way and smile a certain way and deliver the song a certain way,"" he said. ""And if you're outside of that, you're going to get bumped. It just makes music all come out kind of the same. ""The thing that makes it different -- the thing that makes it interesting every once in a while -- is when someone comes along and you think that they're not simply using this as a marketing tool for themselves,"" he continued. ""You see them, and obviously music is the thing that redeems them. ... That to me is what makes music exciting, is when suddenly you see someone and you realize they were meant for music."" And Rundgren? He's still meant for music, too. He's preparing to produce a new New York Dolls album, 36 years after he produced the group's debut. There's also talk he'll perform his 1973 album ""A Wizard, A True Star"" live. It's a full schedule doing something he loves, even if there's virtually no chance he'll be topping the charts. ""The record I made now is kind of a result of where I found myself at. I'm only going to be able to do this for a while longer; I'm 60 now. And regardless of how I behave when I'm on stage, I have the same issues that any 60-year-old does,"" he said, admitting to post-concert aches and pains. He laughed. ""I know I can't stop time, but there will be plenty of time to croon for people.""",0.710479,2489

She has had two number one albums in the Billboard Charts, and in 2009, Swift became the first country music artist ever to win an MTV Video Music Award. Asked what she would have thought had someone told her 10 years ago that she would be famous by the age of 18, she said: ""I thought I was going to do what my parents did. They went to college. They went into business and I loved music and I never imagined that I would actually get to do that as a job. It's wonderful."" Asked why it is that her songs are considered country music, she said: ""I think that what categorizes country music, to me, in my head. I think a country song is when you are singing about being proud of your life. ""I sing about love and boys and that's my life. So that's what fascinates me, feelings, and so I think if you are singing and writing songs about the way that you live your life, that's a country song."" On reports that she is dating teen heartthrob Taylor Lautner, Swift said: ""He's a great guy and we're really close."" But she refused to be drawn on her thoughts about Kanye West, who cut her off as she accepted the award for Best Female Song at the MTV Music Video Awards ceremony. ""I just haven't really changed my mind and that I don't like to talk about it,"" she said.",0.7089951,8467
49,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The members of the band Naturally 7 are experts at blowing their own horns -- and they do it without a trumpet or trombone in sight. Naturally 7 engages in ""vocal play"" in performance, emulating the sounds of musical instruments. In fact, you won't see a single instrument when they hit the stage. They are the instruments. ""People are always imitating instruments,"" said first baritone and arranger Roger Thomas. ""People are driving; they hear their favorite song; it gets to the guitar solo part. ... They don't stop singing. They actually start imitating the instrument they hear. We just decided to be crazy enough to bring [that idea] to the stage."" The septet even came up with a name for it: ""vocal play,"" a total reliance on the human voice to mimic a range of instruments and sounds, including the harmonica, bass guitar, trumpet and DJ scratches.  Watch the band do its thing » . Warren Thomas takes beatboxing to a whole new level with his imitation of a drum kit, complete with snare. (He also impersonates a mean guitar.) Rod Eldridge has never played a real trumpet before, though you wouldn't think that if you saw him duplicate the sound of one, lips pursed, his hands in front of him, pressing on imaginary valves. ""To produce the sound, I have to visualize that I'm holding that instrument or whatever in my hand,"" he said. Only one Naturally 7 member has ever played the instrument he imitates, and that's Armand ""Hops"" Hutton, who uses his incredibly deep voice -- you have to step closer when he speaks -- to portray a thumping bass guitar. The group initially formed a decade ago in New York as an a cappella group (oh, yeah, they sing, too). But to make themselves stand out, Naturally 7 decided to be both a singing group and a band. The concept caught on when video of them performing on a Paris subway -- to hilariously mixed reactions from Parisian commuters -- hit YouTube. It has racked up almost 3 million views. And standing ovations became a regular part of the group's experience touring as the opening act for crooner Michael Bublé in 2007 and 2008. The musicians are about to embark on their own tour of Asia, Australia and Europe. With a recent performance of their aptly named song ""Wall of Sound"" on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" and a new album in the works, they hope to boost Naturally 7's profile in the United States over the next year. Naturally 7 -- which also includes Jamal Reed, Dwight Stewart and Garfield Buckley -- spoke to CNN about the challenges of becoming instruments. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Traveling and sound checks must be very easy for you. Roger Thomas: We don't have to lug around instruments with all the traveling we do, and that does make that part easier. The sound check part of actually becoming the band, where we're actually the singers and the instruments, that probably takes a longer time. CNN: How so? Thomas: I often call our sound man ""Octopus Hands"" because he's just got to do so many different things. We switch from being the backgrounds to being the lead vocals and then going back to doing a trombone. And these have different sounds and settings, so it's a lot of work on the performance side if we're using microphones. CNN: Are your ""instruments"" ever out of tune? Rod Eldridge: Every now and then. It is the voice, and if you're suffering and you have a cold, its not like you can have a guy come in and [say], ""Oh, let me change my guitar string out."" It's a human thing. Every now and then, you're not as perfect as you would like, but you are always working at it. CNN: Are you continually adding new instruments? Thomas: We definitely are. When we hear something that's brand new, we'll just try to get really close to that sound. There are a couple of things we can't do, like a piano. Piano is like a percussive and a string instrument at the same time, so we leave pianos alone. CNN: Who has the hardest job here, do you think? Thomas: I think we all think we have the hardest job. (laughs) Probably Warren. He has to keep up that drum flow for songs that go for five or six minutes and shows that go for almost two hours. That's a pretty difficult job. CNN: You were the opening act for Michael Bublé for a while. That must have been a great way to introduce you to a whole new audience. Armand ""Hops"" Hutton: Yeah, it was great. We started off with him in Rotterdam, and I don't think we were supposed to keep going after Europe, but the marriage between his set and our set was just so perfect that he kept saying, ""I want to introduce you to my fans here, my fans there."" We've been to Australia and Canada ...  all over the world. CNN: How do people respond when you perform? Thomas: Shock, usually. On the Bublé tour, it would take people usually by the third song to actually get it. By then you can see them bouncing around, hitting each other, going, ""This really is all voice!"" CNN: Are you working on a new album? Thomas: We are working in the studio right now, getting ready for what will probably be our first world release. We don't know what we are going to call it yet, but we do know one thing: It will be all vocal.",0.6916174,9270
50,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Sean Kingston was talking about his hit song ""Fire Burning"" when his cell phone suddenly started to ring. The device blasted a familiar tune. Sean Kingston has one of the summer's hottest hits with ""Fire Burning."" She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor. Wait a minute. His own song is his ringtone? ""I've got to support it, man,"" said Kingston, 19, with a cheeky smile. ""It goes right back in my pocket, but hey."" There had better be plenty of room in those pockets. ""Fire Burning"" is shaping up to be one of the summer's hottest tracks, with more than a million downloads sold, and is the second best-selling song on iTunes this week. For mainstream radio listeners and nightclub goers, the reggae-trance track is inescapable. Even for Kingston.  Watch how Kingston sets the dance floor ablaze » . ""Three days ago I was in an elevator,"" he said. ""A lady came in and she had her iPod and she was playing my song. She didn't know who she was standing next to. That was kind of funny."" But hearing his music in public doesn't mean he's allowed to get too cocky, he said. ""It actually motivates me to make even more music, because that's kind of big. Coming from where I'm from -- coming from nothing -- it's just amazing to hear people react to my music like they do."" The Miami-born artist, whose real name is Kisean Anderson -- he changed his name to Kingston to reflect his Jamaican heritage -- got a taste for the big time in 2007 when his debut song ""Beautiful Girls"" became a No. 1 hit in the United States. His sophomore album, called ""Tomorrow,"" comes out September 22. Kingston just wrapped filming in Los Angeles for the music video for its second single, ""Face Drop."" Kingston dropped by CNN to share his thoughts on his abilities on the dance floor and the leading ladies of pop. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: How much time do you actually spend on the dance floor? Sean Kingston: I spend a lot of time on the dance floor, [though] ... I'm more the type of dude to sit back and pose and act cool. But I had to make a song for it because there's a lot of stuff that's going on in the world today ... people want to dance. People want to let loose and ""Fire Burning"" is a song that you can do that to. CNN: You were born in Miami. You grew up in Kingston. Then you moved to L.A. Where do you feel most at home? Sean Kingston: I feel really at home, I can't even lie, in Miami. Because it's just like I know a lot of people, my friends that are there. That's where I started doing music when I was in Miami. CNN: Why call your sophomore album ""Tomorrow""? Kingston: Because I feel like it's so futuristic. I felt like my last album was yesterday. Nobody's going to be able to expect what Sean Kingston is bringing on this new album. CNN: The first track that came off the new album was a collaboration with Lil' Wayne. It didn't take off like your previous hits. Why do you think that is? Kingston: We never sent it to radio. That record got leaked. It got leaked from the Internet and we just kept it going. But it never really got that push from the label. But I mean it did good. I mean 4 million plays on YouTube, 3 million on MySpace. Sometimes you've got to give free music to get people to pay attention and to build a buzz. So I basically gave my fans free music. CNN: You collaborate with punk-pop band Good Charlotte on the album. Kingston: Yeah. Benji and Joel [Madden], man! Those guys are hilarious. They're talented and geniuses. ... The whole ""Tomorrow"" album ... it's ridiculous. I feel like it's going to be the album of the year. I feel like it's my best album that I ever made. It's way better than the first one. CNN: Do you feel like you've pioneered this new sound that combines reggae and hip-hop and other elements? Kingston: I definitely think that's my own style. I definitely think I came in the game and I got my own blend. I've got something that I call hip-pop, not hip-hop. And a lot of people are starting to use that now but I feel like it was my fusion. CNN: Is it fair to say that ""Beautiful Girls"" brought massive change to your life? Kingston: It did. It changed my life like that! No other song did it but that song. I'm blessed. CNN: Are you surprised that it only takes one hit song to make someone a huge star? Kingston: It didn't really quite take me one. It took me one to get in the door. And then it took having a Top Five record. But you've got to understand ... in this music business, there are so many one-hit wonders. You could have a hit, but it's like ""OK, could you follow up?"" So it's not about what your past is, it's about longevity. CNN: You've been the opening act for Gwen Stefani and Beyonce. Who are some other female musicians you admire? Kingston: Man, those two are amazing. Gwen Stefani! That's what you call a star right there. Just to be in her presence ... I learned a lot from her. She's just amazing. Beyonce too. I like Mary J. Blige. Rhianna! I met her a lot of times and she's down to earth. She's so cool. And she's an island girl. And I'm an island dude, and we gotta hold down for other people.",0.68870157,5855
51,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- There's the Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls: blending her voice with singing partner Emily Saliers on songs such as ""Closer to Fine"" and ""Galileo"" and writing songs that tap into the duo's shared folk-oriented touchstones. Amy Ray says playing with some musician friends brought out songs that ""felt very different from the Indigo Girls."" Then there's Amy Ray the solo artist, letting out her inner Joe Strummer and Paul Westerberg. The two aren't mutually exclusive, of course. ""Emily and I are frustrated sometimes with any kind of box,"" Ray says during an interview at her manager's office near downtown Atlanta, ""because we want to experiment musically, and we do a lot of electric stuff. ... But the reality is that we are a folk band."" However, Ray adds, her influences include artists who have come out of a punk mindset such as the Clash, the Replacements, the Pretenders and Patti Smith. ""At some point I was hanging around with the Butchies -- a band I ended up playing with a lot -- and it just brought out this thing in me ... and it felt very different from the Indigo Girls,"" she says. Which explains the appearance of ""Didn't It Feel Kinder"" (Daemon), Ray's third solo album.  Watch Ray perform the song ""She's Got to Be"" » . (Disclosure: Ray and I were contemporaries at Atlanta's Emory University, but we didn't know one another.) The songs on ""Kinder"" include ""Bus Bus,"" a scorching rocker about the longings felt while on tour; ""Who Sold the Gun,"" which alludes to a mass shooting, counterpointed by rousing major chords; and ""SLC Radio,"" which praises the support of a Salt Lake City radio station in the midst of ""LDS nation."" Ray gives a great deal of credit to producer Greg Griffith for the album's raw sound and melodic ideas, and she adds that the musicians on the solo album helped guide the way the songs were presented. ""Something like 'Bus Bus,' I wanted this lead thing going on with a kind of raucous band, and the harmonies are very important but they are more of a bed that you're singing over rather than the duo,"" she says. ""I think the musicians I play with solo do a certain thing that the musicians we play with with the Indigo Girls don't do. It's just a different thing. ... And it sort of steers my writing in some ways."" A number of the solo songs do share the same activist outlook as Ray's songs with the Indigo Girls. ""SLC Radio,"" for example, is about KRCL-FM, which Ray describes as ""a really progressive community station."" In the song, Ray, an out lesbian, sings ""Radio radio SLC fighting the good fight for me/ Boys and girls lend a hand, bend an ear in God's land."" ""I was thinking about community radio in general, and I was thinking about Mormonism and the fabric of the country and how much you see when you're traveling ... and the idea that change comes, but it comes slow, and it comes one person at a time,"" she explains. But, she notes, ""The song is not totally taking Mormonism to task. I even say, 'I'm sending love to all the Mormons,' 'Keep the good things throw out the bad.' "" Respect flows both ways, she says. Ray's activism extends to the artist-centered Daemon Records, the label she founded in 1990. Though Daemon is the furthest thing from corporate -- Ray and the label's staff still stuff envelopes themselves -- she acknowledges that changes in the record business have forced her to adjust as much as any major label.  Watch Ray on keeping the business going » . ""For indie labels it was a big adjustment because we ended up with a lot of CDs on hand when downloading [happened]. We knew it was coming, it came, but it happened a little bit faster [than we thought],"" she says. ""There were business decisions that were hard. ... But I love the freedom that downloading has brought, and I love the way it saves resources."" Besides, she adds, ""The Internet has revolutionized the DIY movement, and it's great to me. I don't even know if record labels need to exist. I don't even know if I need to exist,"" she laughs. But some things about being a musician don't change, such as promotion and performance, which means it's time to hit the road again. Ray will perform with the Indigo Girls in September and then do some solo dates for the rest of the year. A new Indigo Girls album is due out in early 2009. Isn't it exhausting, after more than 20 years in the business, to have to get on the bus again? Ray agrees that touring can be draining. ""It's like you're doing all this stuff, the traveling and the unpacking and the packing, just to play the show. And in that one ... moment during the show, that's the fun. That's where all the fun is,"" she says. ""It's the blessing and the curse of it. ""But it's not like digging a ditch,"" she adds. ""You get to see different places, get to go running in a different town every day. It's very stimulating, and that can be a very good thing.""",0.6845977,2121
52,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (CNN) -- Bjorn Ulvaeus was one half of the songwriting genius behind Swedish pop legend ABBA. After the band split up in 1982 Ulvaeus turned his talents to writing musicals, including ""Mamma Mia,"" now a blockbuster movie. Bjorn Ulvaeus on the ABBA phenomenon: ""I'm amazed how this could happen. I'm just grateful and humble."" He took My City_My Life on a tour of his home town of Stockholm and talked about his past and future as pop royalty. CNN: What is the secret of ABBA's success? Bjorn Ulvaeus: I think the secret behind the fact that our songs are still around and that ABBA became so big is a lot of factors together. But one of them was definitely that we put so much effort into song writing. We hardly ever toured, we just wrote and wrote and produced the records over a period of seven or eight years. So it's the songs, plus I think the two girls, the voices -- the blend was unique and very special. CNN: Where did get the inspiration for your songs? BU: Well mostly in song writing my experience is that there isn't so much inspiration as hard work. You sit there for hours, days and weeks with a guitar and piano until something good comes. But the urge to write is something you have to have. A conviction, an ambition to write and never stop until you think, ""This is the best I can do."" Watch Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm » . CNN: What drives you? BU: In my career the push has always been to take another step, to try something new. That means that after ABBA, when we split up in 1982, we were onto writing a musical [""Chess""] because we hadn't done that before. CNN: How do you feel about working in the theater? BU: Every time I sit in the audience and watch a show that I have been involved with, it is such an amazing feeling to see all those people around me, knowing they are actually watching and enjoying something I have written. That is such a feeling of pure joy that never goes away and that's why I guess I'm so attracted to work in the theater. CNN: How did ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" come about? BU: When you have a big hit on the West End and on Broadway with a musical, as we had with ""Mamma Mia,"" there is always the question, ""when are you going to do the movie?"" Some people say you shouldn't do it until the actual stage musical is on its last legs, but I don't think that matters. We had been on Broadway for seven or eight years and eight or nine in the West End and we thought now is the time to make that movie. CNN: How has Stockholm changed over the years? BU: A city like Stockholm, being so dynamic and following trends, develops all the time. It's gradually changing but you can hardly see that. It is changing in a very healthy way that cities should change. CNN: How would you describe Stockholm in a few words? BU: Stockholm is unique in the world in that it's built on, I think, 14 islands. There are so many bridges and it doesn't have any high-rise buildings to speak of. It's quite spread out and open and airy with lots of parks. See photos of Bjorn Ulvaeus in Stockholm » . CNN: Let's talk about the cultural scene in Stockholm. BU: There is a very vibrant cultural scene in Stockholm. There are lots of places where there are concerts and there are loads of museums and theaters. There is everything really, and eventually there is going to be an ABBA museum as well. CNN: When will that happen? BU: I don't know -- I like to be arm's length when it comes to a museum about oneself. Other people should do that. CNN: That's quite a Swedish trait... BU: A lot of Swedes are quite modest and unassuming. I think that's actually the closest you can get to a national trait, if there is one. CNN: How does it feel that people from different generations are still enjoying ABBA songs? BU: In a way I'm kind of a bystander looking at this phenomenon that is ABBA, which is still around, and that I thought would be finished in 1981 and forgotten. I'm amazed how this could happen and I don't know why it happened. I'm just grateful and humble. I just sit back and enjoy. CNN: What would you like your legacy to be? BU: I would like for my children to feel that what I left behind was something that I did whole heartedly and with honesty, and something that was the best I could do and hopefully that they too can enjoy.",0.6822697,6090
54,"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- The theater was packed as Garth Brooks shared stories about why he decided to officially step out of retirement after nine years. Garth Brooks played two secret concerts in Vegas earlier this summer. Now he's signed on for an engagement. Camera crews and journalists filled the front section. Executives flanked the sides. And then smack dab in the middle of the audience was a row of chefs, enthusiastically applauding in their toques and kitchen whites. Yes, the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement, but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so, because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11. This summer, as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson, the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers. One was an intimate acoustic performance; the other a concert with his full band. He sang. He charmed. He won over staffers who never thought they'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music. And that, ladies and gentleman, exemplifies the uncanny ability of Garth Brooks to connect with human beings, and explains why he -- not Michael Jackson -- is the best-selling solo artist of all time in any genre. (You can look it up.) ""I think my gift truly is I'm an average guy. What I like, an average guy likes. It's that simple. The music that I love, I find that most guys around me love, too,"" he told CNN in his dressing room after Thursday's news conference in Las Vegas. There's a big old-fashioned star on the door that says ""Garth Brooks."" It suits him. Even though he's pushed boundaries and rewritten rules in the music industry, he's still an old-fashioned guy with old-fashioned values -- work hard, stay humble and family first. It's the latter that led to his decision to hang up his mic and his Stetson in 2000. ""We were retiring because I gotta get back to Oklahoma and raise my girls. Sandy and I were getting a divorce at the time, so I couldn't expect her to do my job for me any longer,"" he said. ""We told the people that's what I'm going to do, and the people -- 99 percent of them -- said, 'Go. Go do what you gotta do. We'll be here when you get back,' and we'll see if they are.""  Watch Brooks talk about new course » . Brooks' three daughters -- Taylor, August and Allie -- are now 17, 15 and 13. When he retired, he famously stated that he wanted to be able to drive his kids to school every day. His new Friday-through-Sunday gig will allow him to keep his pledge of seeing them off to class until they head to college. Of course, the commute from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to Vegas will be made a little faster with his new private jet -- an 11-seat Challenger, courtesy of Steve Wynn, the billionaire CEO of Wynn Hotels. ""I don't know anything about jets,"" Brooks downplayed with a shrug. ""It's got a cool interior, cool paint job, I don't know. But it gets me here (to Vegas), and it gets me home to see my girls. And so in that case, it's fabulous."" ""He's been happy being at home, attending every soccer game and knowing what his kids like to eat for breakfast,"" said singer Trisha Yearwood, whom he married in 2005. ""We both came from a family where our parents were there every single day, and so we don't know any other way."" On most weekends, Yearwood will be making the two-hour trip to Sin City -- and every now and again, she'll make an appearance with her husband on stage. ""It's a 'Beauty and the Beast' thing, you know?"" said Brooks. ""I can start a song in one octave and end it up in three keys, not knowing that I've changed. She's precision -- perfect with feeling -- and that's impressive to anybody you bring out."" From time to time, Brooks will bring out special guests, but for the most part, it's a one-man show -- just him, an acoustic guitar and a bunch of great songs and intimate stories. And, of course, there's the audience. ""As long as my gift is here, as long as I open my mouth and it works,"" he said, ""then I think my job is to keep doing it, you know?""",0.67972165,8537
55,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- It was the hottest ticket in town. Colin Farrell was there. So were Michelle Branch, Josh Groban and Chris Isaak -- the latter accompanied by his manager's dog, Rodney. Yusuf, formerly known as Cat Stevens, believes he can help bridge gaps between cultures. No, we're not talking about a Britney Spears or U2 concert. We're talking about a star-studded, invitation-only club show by Yusuf -- the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens. It was the legendary folk singer's first L.A. show in 33 years, and the audience gave him a heartfelt ""welcome back."" He played for just over an hour: half a dozen songs from his new album, ""Roadsinger,"" plus a few gems from the '60s and '70s. It was ""Peace Train"" that elicited a singalong, with the entire room participating in the song's signature hand claps. Branch, who sings backup on Yusuf's new album, admitted to getting teary-eyed. ""You don't understand,"" she said. ""I learned how to play guitar with the Cat Stevens songbook!""  Watch Yusuf talk about his songbook -- and his life » . The whole evening seemed awash in good vibes. Concertgoers didn't even mind having a security guard electronically wand them on the way in. It was perhaps an extra security measure given some of the lingering controversy surrounding the headliner's conversion to Islam at the height of his popularity in 1977, during which time he changed his name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam. In 2004, he was famously denied entry into the United States after his name appeared on a no-fly list. He maintained that it was a case of mistaken identity with another man named Yousuf Islam. However, there was no mistaking the artist on stage at the El Rey Theater last week. At 60, he may look more like a hip college professor than the dark-haired, sensitive sex symbol he was in the '70s, but the message and the music remained the same. The following is an edited version of his interview with CNN. CNN: For a lot of people, it's not only the music but what the music represents. Hearing the old Cat Stevens songs makes people feel warm and fuzzy, a throwback to a simpler time. Yusuf: That's true, and that's why we gave a sprinkling of those songs. When I want to see Paul McCartney, I'd expect to hear ""Eleanor Rigby"" -- something from the past -- because there's something about that that we connect with, and a person becomes part of our life. And I am a part of a lot of people's lives, and my words have resounded in a lot of people's philosophies and the way they look at things, and that's great. Somehow, that's one of the reasons I took life and songwriting very seriously. CNN: But you gave it up for a while. Yusuf: At a certain point I said, ""I've got more living to do,"" and I stopped making music, and I started living. CNN: Many people don't think they start living until they HAVE the fame and fortune. But you didn't start living until you gave it up. Yusuf: It's true. I was very normal -- in some sense, a very shy person. I had to become a persona. I had to kind of put it on a little bit, and therefore I retreated a little bit at a certain point in my career because I thought, ""I can't do this."" So I just became withdrawn, and then people say, ""Well, the guy's a bit of a recluse, you know."" The fact was, I was just a little bit scared of being out there! And I wanted to be sincere, as well. It wasn't easy to be sincere in the music business. CNN: I think a lot of people were surprised when you converted to Islam in the '70s. People didn't understand it. Even today, I think there are those who still don't understand it. Yusuf: It's true. I used to be prejudiced -- as prejudiced as anyone about Islam. ... And then I was given the opportunity of reading the actual source, the Quran itself, without anybody forcing me or looking over my shoulder and saying, ""What do you think?"" It was just me in my space. And the more I read the Quran, the more I realized that it was like an incredible matrix of connection with Christianity and Judaism. I mean Jesus, Moses, the religion of Abraham in this book! And I said, ""Wow, how come I didn't know this before?"" It was kind of like a secret. So that was kind of my discovery, and a lot of people, I don't think, have gone through that process because they've seen Islam as a headline -- and you never learn anything about a headline. Because headlines, you know -- people make things up, to be honest. CNN: In 2004, you were put on a no-fly list and denied entry into the United States. How did you view that? Yusuf: I felt chosen! I felt suddenly, I was given a halo. ""This guy stands for peace, and they won't let him in."" And so I turned it from a no-fly list to a no-song list, and I wrote a song about it (""Boots and Sand""), and I decided to take it lightly. It was really kind of a joke, in a way, because the person I am and the kind of things they were kind of insinuating by putting me on this list with other people who were very dangerous -- . CNN: You mean you're not dangerous? Yusuf: No! Touch me! (laughs) It was upsetting for a lot more people than myself. And you know, I'm here now (in the United States), so things are kind of working themselves out. But there's a new administration, a new president, and it's a great new day. CNN: Obama seems to be reaching out to people of all faiths around the world. Yusuf: I think a person like Obama has some kind of faith in his special role that he has to perform. And that role -- if not prophetic -- it's a divine role. It's helping humanity and people get together and live together and prosper. That's a big demand on one person, so it cannot happen with him alone. There's going to have to be a lot of changes around the world. But it is happening. CNN: There are people who have said you've been associated with groups funneling money to Hamas. Yusuf: Yup. Yeah. So the biggest thing in my life is ... why do I have to defend being charitable? Oh, because somehow, somewhere, somebody got a bit of that money, and he's on a list, and somebody else is on a list -- God almighty! That has nothing to do with me. I'm just trying to be charitable! I think if everybody followed every penny that they ever gave, they would find some very interesting stories behind what has happened to their money. Possibly a lot of it would have gone to waste in administration, as well as other places. It's unfortunate that people have to associate someone because he's got a different faith -- or because he's a Muslim -- with something bad. CNN: Do you believe that will get better? Yusuf: Oh, yeah. I'm very much an optimist. And I believe in the hereafter, as well. And that's a big thing! CNN: Do you believe that you have a role and that your role is to reach out and touch people through song? Yusuf: Very much. I think I've been given a position and place in this world which is quite unique. The fact that I'm a Westerner by birth and I'm a Muslim at the same time -- and living in this time where there seems to be such a gravitational split in polarities -- there need to be bridges, and I think music is one of the best ways to bridge all those gaps.",0.67686045,3905
56,"Friedrich Nietzsche said, ""Without music, life would be a mistake."" Music is a big part of many people's lives. For some, music is life. Sean Forbes, 26, started a nonprofit called D-PAN, or Deaf Performing Artists Network. But not everyone can have music in their lives, and one man is trying to change that for the deaf community. Sean Forbes, 26, started a nonprofit called D-PAN, or Deaf Performing Artists Network, which creates American Sign Language-enhanced music videos. Forbes spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about how D-PAN works. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Forbes: Really, the story here of how the whole thing came up was, I was in a car with three girls, and I went to school at Rochester Institute of Technology in New York. So we took a road trip to Gallaudet University, and on this trip I was singing all of these songs to my friends. And it's just something I've been doing for a while. So I'm signing all of these songs and all the sudden, a light bulb goes on above my head, when I'm like, wouldn't it be cool if there were music videos with deaf performers in them, signing the song, signing the lyrics of the song.  Watch Nicole Lapin's interview with Sean Forbes » . That was really where the idea started from, and I instantly went back to RIT, and I had a friend make me a video of me signing an Eminem song and that's how the whole thing really started. Lapin: Eminem, Christina Aguilera. You started translating really popular music videos, and tell me about these shoots, because this is a really big production you put on. Forbes: Yeah. I mean, we had hearing and deaf people behind the scenes creating this. We had interpreters; there were probably about 20 people on the production set for these videos. Lapin: What was the reaction from some people in the deaf community that never experienced music before, never experienced it before you and D-PAN? Forbes: For me it was just awesome to see all of these deaf people who have never been involved with music be involved in these videos for the first time. A lot of the people who are in the videos never experienced music before. So for them, it was just an awesome experience, and they were really thrilled to be a part of it. Lapin: And a lot of people on our Web site, CNN.com, are thrilled to be part of your experience, being introduced to your story. A lot of questions also came in; I want to bring some to your attention. Ashley has this question for you Sean. ""Has anyone ever told you that D-PAN would not be successful and if so, how did you respond?"" I'm sure you had some haters out there. Forbes: I've had, you know, I've approached a few situations before where they didn't only tell me that D-PAN wouldn't be successful, but they told me that I would never be successful as a deaf musician. And I always laughed it off, because I knew deep inside of me, this is what I wanted. And I wouldn't let anyone tell me no, I wouldn't take no for an answer. So those people who told me no, look at me now.",0.66687304,2482
57,"(CNN) -- The Beatles first appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" 44 years ago. It's also been 44 years since the Beatles held the five top positions of the Billboard pop chart, a feat never achieved before -- or since. Ringo Starr wishes peace and love to everyone following Larry King singing ""Happy Birthday"" to him. But no time has passed since one of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, was playing up on stage. The drummer's 68th birthday Monday coincided with his 10th ""Ringo Starr and his All Stars"" tour. In honor of the day, he asked people to take a moment at noon for peace and love. Thousands joined him in Chicago to do just that. He also celebrated his birthday on ""Larry King Live,"" talking with King about Beatlemania, his new album and the tour. The following is an edited version of the interview: . KING: How did you come up with the idea [of peace and love]? RINGO STARR: Oh it came in a dream -- flaming pie. It's just -- I just thought it would be a nice thing when, you know, because it's my birthday and I'm on tour, everybody is saying what do you want for your birthday? So I thought well, why not at noon doesn't everybody go ""peace and love""?  Watch people celebrate Starr's birthday in London » . KING: That was something the Beatles were always concerned with, weren't they, those kind of themes? STARR: Well, yes. It was part of our generation, of the '60s -- middle '60s, of course and, you know, with flower power and peace and love and that -- I'm just keeping it rolling. That's what I'm doing. KING: Why do you perform? STARR: I perform because that's what I do. When I was 13, the dream was to be a drummer. I didn't want to be a guitarist or anything else. I wanted to be a drummer. That happened. I started playing with local musicians and I always wanted to play with the best musicians around. I ended up in the biggest band in the world with the best musicians. I'm still doing it now. The dream unfolds all the time. I love to play. I love to perform. It's a lot of fun, and it just happens to be what I do. KING: But it's never a grind? STARR: No. Hotels are a grind. The traveling's always a grind. The good things that come out of that is that for ... two hours and 15 minutes a night, you get a chance to just have a great time. KING: How is the all-star band picked? STARR: I picked them because the first rule is that you have to have had a hit in the '60s, which I had, '70s, which I had, '80s or '90s. We're the best 1-800-band that goes live. You know, Colin Hay from Men at Work, Edgar Winter, Billy Squier, Gary Wright [with] ""Dream Weaver,"" Hamish [Stuart] from the Average White Band. Everybody on stage has had hits. The thing is, for the summer collectively, we all get together and support each other. I play on all their songs. They play on mine. Some of them I do from the front. I have this other drummer, Greg Bissonette, who is great. He does those and then I get up and play the drums. I win both ways. KING: Your latest CD is ""Liverpool 8,"" and it is probably -- not probably, it's definitely the most personal of your albums. Why did you do it? STARR: You're a writer, I write with friends. People are talking about the actual title track, ""Liverpool 8,"" which was about my life. The first verse, I was a sailor first; I was in the Merchant Navy. I worked in a factory and then I joined Rory Storm and that's when I went professional as a musician, and we played this holiday camp called Butlin's Holiday Camp, and then we went to Hamburg and we ended up in [New York's] Shea [Stadium]. It's like a mini autobiography. I think that's what people are getting to. KING: How did you get to be a Beatle? STARR: I got it because I'm an incredible musician, and I knew the boys, and they gave me -- I was playing with Rory. They gave me a call and said, do you want to join the band. I said, sure. That's how it happened. KING: Did you like that band right off? STARR: No. I liked that band before I was in it. It was the only band I used to go and see in Liverpool. We became friends before that, before I joined. We were all playing in the same venues. Actually, Rory Storm and the Beatles played in Germany together. It wasn't like I was some stranger they called up. KING: Did you like the other drummer? STARR: The other drummer was the other drummer, you know. A lot of water has gone under the bridge. They, for their reasons, decided they wanted a change, and I am the result. KING: How fortunate for everyone. You and Paul McCartney are the two still alive. You were with us last year in Vegas in an extraordinary show. This may be difficult. What was it like to be a Beatle? STARR: Well, it's difficult, because what was it like? I mean, it was incredible. It was hard, because when we started we were a club band and then it got bigger and bigger. Because we were four brothers together, we supported each other. But you cannot not say that it wasn't crazy days and reckless nights. That's what it was. You know, in the end, you know, the one big image that we had, the whole floor of the Plaza [Hotel] in New York and the four of us were hanging out in the bathroom trying to get away from the pressure. KING: Do you still listen to the Beatles? STARR: Yes, of course I do, some great tracks. My iPod is on shuffle. I have Beatle tracks in it. So they come up and, you know, the music is still, you know -- I love the music. KING: Why or how do you explain their long lasting? STARR: Because they were great songs and, you know, we were incredible musicians who gave those songs incredible life. KING: Do you think the Beatles would be a success today? STARR: Sure. KING: Great music is great music. STARR: Hey, I mean, the kids of today don't know us really, but they know the music. You know, they're still listening to it and saying wow! You talk to any new band, most of them have actually had a listen to what we did. KING: Anything you want to do, Ringo, you haven't done? STARR: No, I'm sort of doing enough. It's good. And I'm privileged and blessed that I can do what I want to do, when I want to do it. KING: And it's still -- when you're on that stage, hitting those drums and the band is going -- . STARR: Love it.",0.6633345,9287
58,"BEVERLY HILLS, California (CNN) -- Here's what happens when you go to interview Aretha Franklin: Her publicist will e-mail the cell phone number of her security man to your BlackBerry. Once you reach the lobby of the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, you call the cell phone. Someone will come down to get you and bring you up to her suite, where you'll be greeted by Carlton, her longtime makeup artist. Aretha Franklin was voted the No. 1 singer of all time in a Rolling Stone survey. Then you look around, and you notice Aretha -- the Queen of Soul and recipient of 18 Grammys -- is quietly padding around the room in jeans, a turquoise T-shirt and flip-flops. She'll offer you ""a seat and Cokes"" -- then proceed to shoot the breeze, while you and your camera crew invade her room to set up for the interview. Then it hits you. You may be an Aretha Franklin groupie, but Aretha is a groupie of CNN. She loves to talk politics, and she's up-to-the-minute in terms of information. President-elect Barack Obama is her man. After seeing his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, she invited him to be her honored guest at an event in her hometown of Detroit, Michigan. He couldn't come, but she's been a loyal supporter since then. She'll sing at his inauguration in January. In the meantime, Rolling Stone magazine, in a poll of music industry heavyweights, just named her the No. 1 singer of all time. And there's her new holiday album, ""This Christmas, Aretha."" In a career that's spanned more than 50 years, it's the first seasonal CD she's ever made. Aretha helps us set the stage for Santa (eggnog optional). Aretha Franklin: The snow is lightly falling -- you get the picture -- you're by the fireside with your sweetie, and no Aretha! There's no Aretha in the music! What's going on?! So I had to do an album. CNN: You've been wanting to do a holiday album for a long time. Franklin: For many years, I've wanted to do one, and I've always mentioned it to the chieftains, and they would say things like, ""Oh well. Christmas albums don't sell,"" and things like that. But that's not the point. Christmas albums are important. The music is important. The season is important. CNN: On ""This Christmas, Aretha,"" there are some traditional songs and some more contemporary tunes. Franklin: We did ""Silent Night,"" ""Angels We Have Heard on High,"" ""14 Angels"" -- which comes from the classic ""Hansel and Gretel,"" the opera. What else did we do? ""This Christmas"" by Donny Hathaway and ""Christmas Ain't Christmas (Without The One You Love)"" by the O'Jays. Those two are my favorites. They're the first two records that are going to play in the Franklin household every Christmas. CNN: What was Christmas like for you growing up? Franklin: Christmases past, my sister, Carolyn, and I -- we'd been waiting for Santa all night. Nothing! Where is this man? And we're looking all up in the sky all night long, until I guess about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. Finally, we just fell out. We couldn't take it anymore. [We'd wake up in the morning and] come downstairs, and everything was under the tree! We couldn't believe it! Where did these things come from? You know, we just couldn't believe it. CNN: Did you believe in Santa Claus for a long time? Franklin: For a while, I did. And then I started getting the idea that it wasn't Santa -- it was Dad. CNN: What's Christmas like now? Do you cook, or do you have someone help you cook? Franklin: Oh absolutely, puh-leeze! Nobody else better cook on the holidays except me! I do everything -- the traditional fare. You have the turkey, the baked ham with the brown sugar glaze. We have the mixed greens, we have fried corn, we have the sweet potato pies, you have the potato salad -- the whole nine yards is on the table. Everything is from scratch. Men don't like eating out of cans. And I don't like eating out of cans too much, either. CNN: Have you ever done a cookbook? Franklin: No, I haven't, but I plan to. CNN: Do you gather 'round the piano and sing Christmas carols? Franklin: After dinner, we do. We sing a little bit. We might be playing cards, we might be playing Monopoly. The children are just running in and out of the rooms, and up and down the steps. They love the workout room. CNN: How many people do you generally have over? Franklin: Usually, about 15 or so. My neighbors, my friends and family. My nieces, my grandchildren. CNN: On election night, I hear you all got together to watch the presidential returns. Franklin: We had an Obama pajama party -- and it was really cool -- at one of the casinos in Detroit. We sat there and watched the returns. Started at 6 o'clock, and we had like three or four screens going -- and, of course, we had CNN going, and I'm not just sayin' that because I'm sitting here. At that magic moment, the room just erupted. It was like, ""Whoa!"" All of the screaming and just -- I can imagine what people thought outside in the hallways! CNN: Did you ever think you'd see a black man elected president in your lifetime? Franklin: Absolutely. Absolutely, I did, yes -- after Reverend [Jesse] Jackson made his run, and Shirley Chisholm, so long before. I thought maybe even Colin Powell might run after Reverend Jackson. I did. CNN: Do you already have your dress for the inauguration? Franklin: Honey, I've had my dress for months! CNN: I hope you have a hotel reservation -- otherwise, you'll be begging for a bed at a youth hostel. Franklin: Oh, no. I don't stay at those places. CNN: You want a job in Barack's Cabinet? Franklin: Yeah, I want a job in Barack's Cabinet. How about a job, Mr. Obama? Please?! PLEASE?!! (She cracks up.)",0.6630533,8481
59,"(CNN) -- Singer Nelly Furtado is trying to cross over in a direction many artists don't ordinarily take. Singer Nelly Furtado says she enjoys diversity in music and broadening her fan base. With ""Mi Plan,"" the Grammy Award-winning singer is taping into a brand new market and fan base, almost a decade after she came to fame in 2000 with the single ""I'm Like a Bird."" While the Canadian-born singer -- whose parents are Portuguese -- has sung in Spanish before, ""Mi Plan"" is the first time she has recorded an entire album in Spanish, a language she said she learned as a teen. It's seems like a natural progression for Furtado, an artist often noted for diversity in her sound. A few years after her breakthrough, Furtado teamed up with superproducer Timbaland for her 2006 album ""Loose,"" a collaboration that gained her scores of hip-hop and R&B fans as well, and spawned hits such as ""Promiscuous"" and ""Say It Right."" ""Mi Plan"" pairs her with a few Spanish-language music artists, including Alex Cuba, Juan Luis Guerra, Julieta Venegas and La Mala Rodriguez, as well as English-language artist Josh Groban. The first single off the album, ""Manos Al Aire,"" made history as it marked the first time a North American artist reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart with a song that was originally written in Spanish, rather than a translated version of an English-language song. Furtado spoke with CNN about her passion for Spanish, why she feels like an artist reborn and the career path she hopes to take. CNN: What was the inspiration for the new album? Nelly Furtado: There were so many inspirations. The language was the biggest inspiration. I've sang so much in Spanish in the past, and also Portuguese. I get a lot of joy in singing in Latin languages. It expresses the Latin side of me.  Watch Furtado talk about her new album » . My parents were born in Portugal and they raised us in Canada. We grew up speaking Portuguese and then I learned Spanish at the age of 14. I love being a multicultural artist, I love being a global artist. [The album] is almost like a literal reflection of that this time in the fact that it's all in Spanish and it's a completely original project written from scratch. CNN: So it's all new? Furtado: Yes. It feels like a rebirth of sorts. It's almost like a parallel world where I get to reinvent myself again as an artist, but in a very whole kind of way. It's been a lot of fun. CNN: You have such a loyal fan base. What do you hope they get from your latest project? Furtado: Just because I have collaborated with so many different people with so many different styles of music that I think my sort of goal or mantra my whole career has been to broaden the minds of my fan base. This album is just an extension of that. I'm an inclusive person and everyone is invited to the fiesta. I'm excited because I am meeting brand new fans for the first time who don't have any of my prior albums. Four albums in, it's a tough job to try to attract new fans and I think that's what I am doing with this new music. CNN: Did you consider it risky to do a Spanish-language album? Furtado: I like to take risks. I live for risk taking and challenges. I just find it so much more exciting and it keeps my job entertaining and interesting. Everyone is looking for that next challenge at work. Everyone wants that extra credential on their business card. If it's easy, it's not fun. CNN: How is performing in Spanish different? Furtado: When I express myself in Spanish or in Portuguese I feel very free. There are a lot of things you can say in a Spanish song that you can't say in an English song, especially from a feminine perspective. As a female, the moment you sing too passionately in English you are kind of labeled as an angry singer. In Spanish that doesn't happen. You can be dramatic as you want and it's accepted. So it's liberating. CNN: There are a lot of Spanish-speaking artists who want to cross over into the English-language market. How does it feel to be doing the reverse? Furtado: I think I'm capitalizing a little bit on the inroads I have already made in the Latin world through working with other established Latin acts. I dabbled in Spanish on my third album. I had two records on there in Spanish and I really enjoyed writing them and playing them live. I'm just going where my heart's at and following the passions. CNN: What's next for you? Furtado: It's interesting because when I got off the road from touring with my third album, ""Loose,"" I was exhausted. I tried to write some songs in English and no inspiration really came to me. Then I started writing songs in Spanish and it started flowing, so this album has been like a medicine of sorts. I'm so excited about music now. I can't wait to put out another project in English and further Spanish albums as well as Portuguese. The list is never-ending.",0.656723,6369
61,"PLAYA DEL REY, California (CNN) -- The black sedan pulled up to the parking lot at Dockweiler State Beach in California, and the five members of The Lost Trailers stepped out -- no chauffeur, no publicist, no manager, no entourage. From left to right, Jeff Potter, Stokes Nielson, Ryder Lee, Manny Medina and Andrew Nielson of The Lost Trailers. But that's the way this rising country band rolls these days. When they embarked on their current ""Lean, Clean and Local"" tour, they streamlined their operation in the greenest way possible. Since September, they've reduced their carbon footprint by 132 tons. That meant giving up their tour buses, as well as their road crew and traveling with their own equipment. Their new buzz phrase is ""hiring local"" -- local roadies, local T-shirt vendors, local suppliers for amps and equipment. If they can't stuff it in a suitcase, they don't bring it. The Lost Trailers have also partnered with Keep America Beautiful, a national organization dedicated to litter reduction and recycling. On a recent day off in Los Angeles, singer Ryder Lee, guitarist Stokes Nielson, bassist Manny Medina, keyboardist Andrew Nielson and drummer Jeff Potter met up with a group of young adults from the L.A. Conservation Corps for a little coastal cleanup -- country style.  Watch the band at work on the beach » . Three of the band members sported cowboy boots as they sifted through the sand. The kids were from South Central Los Angeles, an inner-city area not generally known for its love of country music. After the cleanup, we pulled the CNN van up to the beach, popped in The Lost Trailers' CD, and hit ""play"" on their hit single, ""Holler Back."" As the fiddle and banjo strains of the high-octane hillbilly tune blared through the speakers, there were blank stares all the way around from the students. But after joining in the chorus of ""heys"" and ""hos,"" one young man named Virgil LaFlora started rapping over the verses. It was the most unexpected country/hip-hop mash-up since Tim McGraw and Nelly joined forces for ""Over and Over"" in 2004. All of a sudden, the two camps had discovered some common ground, and the song ended in cheers and hugs. One girl asked if she could have the CD. CNN talked to the Trailers' members about their activism and their tour. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: ""Lean, Clean and Local"" isn't just about recycling. You guys are actually going into the community and hiring local people. Stokes Nielson: We did a show with Tim McGraw in New York at the end of last year. It was a fly date for us, so we hired local, and this guy came up to us and said, ""Thank you so much for hiring local, 'cause I haven't had a check in three weeks."" And we realized as the recession was heading into place, that one of the things we could do to benefit these communities is hire local, and not just bring in our own crews and just extract money form the locals and then leave, but we could also leave a small stimulus of our own. CNN: As rising artists, you work hard to earn the right to have a tour bus. Now you're giving it up. Stokes Nielson: Since we won't have a crew, we thought, ""OK, we're not going to have the bus anymore, and we're just going to fly to dates,"" and that cut down our diesel consumption. Andrew Nielson: We travel really light so that we can roll into town, hire the crew, and also hire local equipment. Potter's a drummer, and everywhere we go, we rent drums. Jeff Potter: We were trying to figure out a way that was practical to get a drum set on a plane, but it didn't really work out. I like it because I get to show up, and somebody working there locally has already set it up for me, and I get to just sit down and play. Ryder Lee: We were trying to get Potter some of those electric drum pads (which will fit into a suitcase), but that's just not as cool. CNN: Or you could just get a drum machine and eliminate the problem altogether! That would save the most money. Potter: I like being in the band. Manny Medina: I'm afraid they're going to hire local bass players, and I'll be out of a job! (Laugh) CNN: Do you save money by hiring local, or does it cost you more this way? Stokes Nielson: No, it's about even. It's not about the money. Obviously, the government is putting a lot of money into trying to get this thing (the economy) kick-started. As small-business owners, we want to do our part as well. It's also really been great to realize that we actually can do something besides just writin' a song and singin' it. Lee: We've set up a Web site: LeanCleanAndLocal.com, and that's become kind of a Yellow Pages for the local businesses we've hired. And we have videos on there, and a directory of the folks we've used, so if other acts were to hire this way, they could come in and use these same people. CNN: Doesn't that lead to disaster sometimes? Medina: So far, it's been great. Potter: Either we've been very lucky, or we've really come up against some great people, but when you're a national act, there's a certain level of competence with the people you deal with, and that's great to see. CNN: I'm sure there were a lot of organizations you looked at before partnering up with Keep America Beautiful. Why that organization? Lee: I think as country artists, it's really important to preserve the things that we grew up with. We're naturally outdoors men because of where we grew up, and keeping the rivers and streams clean is part of being country, and we're really proud of that. And Keep America Beautiful and their efforts in recycling and litter cleanup was really fitting for us, so it was a natural place to reach out -- not to mention, at our shows, there tends to be a few bottles and cans that build up. (Laugh) Stokes Nielson: This tour may not last forever. Maybe just until the recession is over. But definitely, we want to do our part to give back. Medina: Plus you really get to know the towns better. You meet the people. You don't just stay on your bus, play a show and leave. You really get to know the towns.",0.6566037,4304
62,"New York (CNN) -- Jazz master Wynton Marsalis says the blues is the true American music -- the heartbeat and unifying principle of jazz, country, R&B, gospel and other styles -- but it's been relegated to the back of the bus by greed and the legacy of racism. Marsalis grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana, son of Dolores and Ellis Marsalis. He was a trumpet prodigy, surrounded by top-notch musicians and steeped in the city's eclectic music. He was encouraged to excel by his father, a jazz pianist who instilled in his son a love of musical excellence and integrity. Marsalis plays classical and jazz music with equal mastery. He is artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center  and has won nine Grammy Awards and the Pulitzer Prize in music. He will be awarded the French Legion of Honor on November 6. In an interview Tuesday, Marsalis talked to CNN.com about the primary position of the blues in American music. The blues is our root music, American born-and-bred, but it's been treated like a stepchild of dubious origin, granted only secondary status, in Marsalis' view. It suffuses Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, rock 'n' roll, country-western, gospel, bluegrass and more, but never got its financial due or the respect it deserves. Marsalis says that's because of racism -- it was the music of a whole people granted only secondary status -- and its inability to make a lot of money. He also talks about his father, how slavery has affected the nation, and some lessons to be learned from jazz. CNN: You have a DVD out called ""Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis Play the Music of Ray Charles."" That's jazz, country and R&B. What do those styles have in common? WYNTON MARSALIS: The blues. It runs through all American music. Somebody bending the note. The other is the two-beat groove. It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel. The other is the down-home sensibility that's sophisticated. That's why Louis Armstrong could play with Jimmy Rogers. Ray Charles is actually the embodiment. He and Willie Nelson came 'round in young manhood at a time in the late '40s early 1950s when all of the American music, root music, was all combined. It became segregated in the mid- to late-'50s. Carl Perkins had a hit in 1955 -- ""Blue Suede Shoes."" It was on the R&B charts, it was on the country charts, it was No. 1 on the rock and roll charts. [It was] basically the same music, so there was an intersection point. It's like in cuisine, that would be like fried chicken and red beans and rice, it would be like potato salad and barbecued ribs. Someone in Texas not going to eat barbecued ribs? CNN: What led to the compartmentalization of these kinds of music, that came from the same roots? MARSALIS: Money and racism. I don't know which one came first. CNN: Why was blues not regarded as something of value in this country? MARSALIS: It came from who we didn't like. That's what it was -- it wasn't that we couldn't see it. Who it came from, we did not like them. CNN: So do you include African-Americans in that? So black people didn't appreciate it? MARSALIS: They didn't appreciate it. They don't now. That's part of the whole kind of self-hatred that comes from that type of slavery that the black American still labors under. That racism was heavy. The legacy of it -- it wasn't just 50 years. It was seven generations, and if a generation is 33 years, ... seven or eight [generations]. That's a long time. And to recover from it has proven to be very difficult. CNN: So is that what's going on with rap? MARSALIS: No question. Rap is the repetition of the minstrel show. But it's not going to go away, it was too many people. If it had been 100,000 people, it can go away. ... But it can't be millions of people and their descendants. [Slavery] was a very powerful and successful system. And it went on for a long time. In the aftermath of slavery ... there was a retrenching, and [it turned into] the type of racism that was experienced by people who came to the North. That consciousness has begun to shift, in the last 30 years. And that's 20 or 30 years of just thawing and shifting that's attached to 330 years [of slavery], and the thought you can get up and you will be better ... that's just asinine, it's absurd. CNN: But didn't the blues come from this, being marginalized? MARSALIS: The blues was like a solution to that, an antidote to it. But the blues is not only Afro-American music. CNN: So, you've written that it's not just African, it's American. What about America gave rise to the blues? MARSALIS: It is America. It's that combination, those tensions, the east-west tensions, the kind of tension of being a slave in the land of freedom, and the land of freedom itself, the Western mind, the concept of soloing across time, the call-and-response of democracy, direct call and response, the kind of optimism that is American in nature, is in the blues. There are elements in it that are African and there are elements of the American take on Europeanism. It's integrated, it's like a person whose DNA is integrated. You start to try to figure it out -- but you can't. That's how the blues is, that's why it fits with everything, country-western, bluegrass -- everybody's playing the same music. CNN: You write that jazz leaves room for individual creativity, but you have to listen and allow the other musicians to participate equally. So what's the lesson for the nation? MARSALIS: We have to have an overall cultural objective, which we don't have. ... We then fight under the flag of a position, the left or the right, black or white, old or young. It's very simplistic. We don't know our cultural history, we don't know we are together, and because we don't know we are together we can't act in that way. And that's the main thing our music, and the history of our music, can teach us as a nation. The one concept that has to be at the heart of the American experiment is integrity. The integrity of the process is very important. If you come up on the bandstand you have to be at least trying to swing. If you don't really want to swing or play with the musicians, there's nothing they can do, because you have the freedom to destroy it. CNN: Your father set an example. It sounds like you got a lot of your ideas about integrity from him. MARSALIS: Yes, he sure did. From him. He wasn't segregated about any music, he didn't care, you could play pop music, funk, he'd say ""right, great man."" He was a jazz musician. He wasn't uptight and always railing about somebody. What he did was very clear, and what he thought about being a man, he didn't look at a boy like that. I remember he sat in with our funk band one time. ... We'd go to his gig, there'd be six people. We'd go to our gig, there'd be thousands of people, dancing having a good time. We were playing a dance at a high school, he didn't know any of the music, but he played all of the music we had. We were laughing, we said, my daddy didn't know any of the music and he didn't know any of the tunes but he was playing better than us. CNN: When you were playing in a funk band in high school, did you look at your jazz musician dad as old school? MARSALIS: No, no, never, I never suffered from that misconception, because he was so much hipper than the people I was around. Philosophically, he knew more than we did. I'd bring people to see him. He never tried to act like a child, like a kid. I never thought I knew more than him, he was on the case. CNN: What are the components of jazz? MARSALIS: The main three components are the blues, improvisation -- which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up -- and swing, which means even though they're making up music, they're trying to make it up together. It feels great, like you're having a great conversation with somebody. Sometimes you get in a good coordinated groove, and it just continues to happen.

63,"(CNN) -- Billy Ray Cyrus may be a country boy at heart, but he is also pretty savvy when it comes to navigating Hollywood. Billy Ray Cyrus has a full plate with acting, touring, composing and being a dad. When others wrote him off as a novelty act after the 1992 hit ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" Cyrus kept making music and eventually turned to acting. It was a decision he said came after some well-timed fatherly advice. ""In the mid-'90s, my dad said to me 'Son, you've got all of your eggs in one basket and you are living and dying by music,' "" Cyrus recalled. ""He said 'I want you to have a career like Kenny Rogers.' "" Cyrus said his dad suggested he branch out into acting. Cyrus eventually auditioned for and won a role in what appeared to be an unlikely vehicle -- David Lynch's 2001 film ""Mulholland Drive."" After Lynch, known for such works as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks,"" suggested that Cyrus should continue to pursue the craft, he went on to star in the television drama ""Doc,"" which also helped spur the career of Cyrus' greatest production -- ""Hannah Montana"" star, and Cyrus' daughter, Miley Cyrus. Now, with the release of ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" on Blu-ray and DVD, a music tour and an upcoming role in a film featuring comedian George Lopez and martial arts expert Jackie Chan, Cyrus is staying busy. He recently took some time out of his hectic schedule to talk to CNN about how he keeps it all together, how he manages raising a family full of performers (son Trace is a member of the band Metro Station, daughter Brandi performs with the band Frank and Derol and also acts, as do younger children Braison and Noah) and what makes him a good fit for Hollywood. CNN: What do you like about ""Hannah Montana: The Movie?"" Billy Ray Cyrus: I think it's got a certain amount of realism to it with art imitating life imitating art. It certainly parallels a lot of things in mine and Miley's real world and real lives. I wrote the song ""Back to Tennessee"" and as I read the script for the movie, ""Back to Tennessee"" became a cornerstone of the film and the title track off the album. The realism of the film translates into the music, and I think vice versa. CNN: The film speaks to never losing touch with your roots. How important is that to you? Cyrus: Extremely. My dad told me as a kid to always be aware of where you are, always have a vision for your future, but never forget where you came from. CNN: You've had careers in both music and acting. Do you still feel a bit like a fish out of water dealing with Hollywood? Cyrus: I love Hollywood as far as being an actor. Getting to work with Jackie Chan and George Lopez in this new film we have coming out in January [""The Spy Next Door""], working with Heather Locklear and Patricia Neal in the Lifetime movie ""Flying By"" and Brooke Shields, who has appeared as my deceased wife on ""Hannah Montana."" I look back at it now and think that I may fit in more to the film community than I do Nashville, to tell you the truth. I love what I do. CNN: Do you have a preference, then, for acting over music? Cyrus: My preference is to find projects that can combine the two. I also love to write scores. I wrote a lot of the scores for ""Doc"" and I love to write scores for other projects. CNN: How do you balance being a star with being a dad? Cyrus: The very best I can. I just take it one step at a time and do the best I can. My dad was to me what I try to be to Miley, which is somewhat of a best friend. I try my best to be a good daddy and if she wants to talk about business or music I try my best to be a good manager. I try to be all of those things because that's what my dad was to me. Unfortunately, my dad passed away four years ago from mesothelioma, but I feel like in some ways my dad is looking down on me and smiling. His name was Ronald Ray Cyrus and a lot of people say Miley changed her name to Miley Ray because of Billy Ray, but that's not true. She did that in honor of my dad, because the two of them just loved each other to pieces. CNN: So will Miley ever remake ""Achy Breaky Heart""? Cyrus: I doubt it, but anything is a possibility. In 1991 I recorded ""Achy Breaky Heart"" and we are not too terribly far away from the 20-year anniversary, and there are some major stars who want to re-do that song. I'm flirting with the idea. There's one cat in particular that if I told you who it was, it would blow your mind. But I've got to keep it under my hat right now.",0.64882195,8059
64,"(CNN) -- Andrew McMahon always wanted to be a rock star. When his band, Jack's Mannequin, started touring in spring 2005, the unexpected happened. Andrew McMahon, singer for the band Jack's Mannequin, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2005. McMahon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Four years later, McMahon, now 26, is still at it. He has a new album out called ""The Glass Passenger"" and has taken the driver's seat in starting a cancer research organization, the Dear Jack Foundation. CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke with McMahon about living and working with cancer and now singing about it. The following is an edited transcript of the interview.  Watch Andrew McMahon's entire interview » . Nicole Lapin: For those people who don't know, you were formerly the front man for Something Corporate. When you started touring there, you had a bout with leukemia. When you were 22, you were diagnosed. What happened there? You first thought it was just fatigue, but it was something a lot worse. Andrew McMahon: Yeah, I was on the road. It was actually Jack's [Mannequin's] first tour; we had actually just finished recording ""Everything in Transit,"" which was my first record apart from Something Corporate. I was on the road and just kept losing my voice. It was just this thing that I couldn't figure out. I always had kind of this really durable voice and was known for being able to go out all night and wake up the next morning and be signing like a bird. Sure enough, I went to my voice doctor in New York City after having to cancel a show, and he thought I looked pale and didn't think I looked well, and he took my blood. They sent me to the hospital for more tests, and I found out the next week [that I had leukemia]. Lapin: But you kept touring. McMahon: No, after that point I was in the hospital. I started in New York and eventually flew back here and was treated at UCLA by a great doctor there. I spent the better part of six to eight months kind of battling back from that. I had a stem cell transplant from my sister in that period of time, and I eventually got back on the road the following summer.",0.6416028,3009
65,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Whenever you speak with Carlos Santana, you pretty much know what you're going to get: lots of talk about love and light. spiritual analogies, name-dropping of people like Marvin Gaye and Mother Teresa. Carlos Santana will start a 72-show residency in Las Vegas in May at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. It may take a moment to enter the humble headspace of the 61-year-old guitarist legend, but once you're there, you realize that this is a man who acts with his heart instead of his head. Somehow, he's managing to live out his 1960s ideals in 2009 -- and he wants fans to experience a piece of that with his new Las Vegas, Nevada, show, ""Supernatural Santana: A Trip Through the Hits."" The 72-show residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino launches May 27, with 36 concerts this year and 36 in 2010. As with all his events, a portion of the cost of each ticket will be donated to the Milagro Foundation, the charitable organization founded by Santana and his family to benefit children around the world.  Watch Santana get into the groove » . Santana talked to CNN about the Vegas show and his beliefs. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: Your Vegas show sounds like it's your greatest hits mixed with a little bit of Carlos Santana spirituality. Carlos Santana: They're inseparable at this point. We're very different than a lot of bands. A lot of bands concentrate on show business and entertainment. We focus on light and touching people's hearts. We really believe that by coming to Las Vegas, it gives us an opportunity to take ourselves and the people who come to listen to us into a place where people are free from thinking they're sinners or unworthy. There's something really wonderful about music when music makes men and women dance, laugh and cry at the same time, because they're receiving like a Holy Ghost thing. CNN: Ticket prices range from $79 up to $299 -- which is a lot of money for some people in this economy. Santana: I have no clue about that. I'm more with, ""This finger goes onto this note and it makes juicy sounds, and I'm going to make people dance and laugh."" It's not like I don't care or I'm ignorant. It's just that I'm not wired to have that insignificance on me other than what I'm going to get to give back to other people. And other than that, I trust that the people around me -- which is my sister and my brother-in-law -- will take care of all of those dimensions. We don't like to gouge people, but we do like to be realistic that you do need to pay the rent ... and stuff like that. But other than that, since I was a child, I really don't put that much focus or significance into it. CNN: You're well-loved by mainstream audiences, and the Latino audience has been really supportive, too. Do you think this is opening up the door to perhaps invite the Latino audience to Vegas? Santana: They're already there. They're washing dishes and folding sheets -- I'm serious. The Latin community is there. It's just that we don't see them. ... I don't belong to just Latinos just because I speak Spanish. We go to Ireland, and if we go to Pakistan, or Istanbul or Malaysia, we're part of the family. We just did a tour in South America, and I have never seen so many children come to our concerts in my life -- and I've been doing this since '67. CNN: You were born in Mexico, and President Obama will be heading there to talk about the war on drugs. [Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton recently made some remarks that United States drug consumption is partially to blame for this problem. Do you agree with that? Santana: Totally. I think that the solution to all of this stuff would be to legalize it, decriminalize it, reinvest all that money into teachers in schools. ... If we would teach in schools the incredible sensation of climax that it feels to be of service to other people -- like Mother Teresa, or Desmond Tutu or the Dalai Lama -- smoking pot, and drinking tequila, and watching porno or whatever people do, it pales in comparison when you actually wake up to be of service to people. To go back to the question -- I think we should legalize marijuana. I think Barack Obama should bring the brothers and sisters home -- the soldiers. If I was to see him, I would go, ""Listen to Marvin Gaye's 'What's Going On' and John Coltrane, and bring the boys home from the war now, like we did with Vietnam."" They're not going to come here. People in Vietnam did not come here to attack us after we left them alone. So let's get rid of that fear, that fantasy, that stuff. Let's get rid of the bogeyman, because the bogeyman is us looking in the mirror of each other. CNN: What about when people don't get it, Carlos? What if they're listening to you and thinking, ""He sounds like one of those New Age Californians, and I really don't get what they're doing out there."" Santana: Well, they don't get it because they're stuck in something that is not working. Like, for example, a lot of people are stuck with certain parts of the Bible, believing that God is vengeful and jealous. That's Godzilla! I'm not stuck with a God like that. I'm stuck with a God that's all love, all compassion, all light, and he only sees you with purity and innocence, like the brand-new eyes of a child that's just been born. ... A lot about Las Vegas is illusion. It's entertainment and show business. We don't know none of that. We only know to go into your heart and help you remember that it's there. I know a lot of rich millionaires who are not happy, and you're only happy when you're doing something. CNN: Are you happy? Santana: I'm very, very happy because I'm grateful. My priorities finally have been crystallized. I started washing dishes, and now I do this. And this is a lot of fun.",0.6398736,7645
66,"(OPRAH.com) -- He can saw himself in half, sing a selection of Broadway showtunes and swing on a flying trapeze. Neil Patrick Harris says he'll try to make viewers feel like they're in good hands with him as Emmy host. When Neil Patrick Harris, one of the stars of the hit CBS sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother,"" isn't dabbling in the extraordinary, well, he's probably hosting an awards show. In the late '80s, Neil -- known as NPH to his fans -- landed the starring role on ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" After years of child stardom and teen heartthrob status, Neil left the small screen for the stage. He became a respected Broadway actor, starring in shows like ""Rent,"" ""Cabaret"" and ""Proof,"" before returning to television. Now, millions know Neil as Barney Stinson, the womanizing, slap-happy sidekick on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" which begins its fifth season September 21. Like Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson before him, this man-of-many-talents is also making his mark as an awards show host. On Sunday, September 20, Neil will host the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. He shares his thoughts on fate, finding balance and making out with his co-star. Kari Forsee: How are you preparing for Emmy night? Neil Patrick Harris: I'm just trying to make sure all the comedy host elements are in place. We'll have a good opening bit and a couple surprise things throughout. We want to balance respecting the show and the doling out of the awards with the sort of random things that will keep the audience's attention in other ways. So that's kind of been my job. You want to make it unique and, yet, classic. That's a tricky dynamic. Oprah.com: Planning an Emmys party? Get 4 entertaining solutions . KF: I can imagine. How often are you rehearsing? NPH: Well, it's sort of a litany of e-mails and phone calls all day with the producers. We had a great opening short film we are going to shoot, and it would be the first thing you shot. That was going to be with Alec Baldwin, and he withdrew at the last minute. So that got scrapped, and we're off to plan D, E or F. It's sort of like now you go: ""That's fantastic, great. We've got that person,"" or ""Oh, that person didn't work. Now what do we do?"" A lot of ""now what do we do?"" questions. KF: Now at the Tony Awards, you sang a, may I say, legendary closing number. Will you be singing at the Emmys, or is dancing more the focus? NPH: I suspect you won't see me dancing very much. That's not my forte. But yeah, I might throw some sort of singing into it. I haven't quite decided. I sort of feel like the Emmys are so classy and glamorous and black tie, the host really needs to respect his job title. I think too much ""Look at me! Look at me!"" as the host of a show that big is counterproductive. So long as I make you feel confident that you're in good hands with me as the host, then it's my real responsibility to introduce you to a lot of other people and elements -- other presenters who are then going to talk to you or other introductions of next sections. That's my role. It's not really to be a song-and-dance man. KF: Did you look back at past Emmy hosts for inspiration? NPH: Very much. Steve Allen hosted the first televised awards, which was the 7th Annual Emmy Awards, in, I think, 1955, and he was great. That was sort of my inspiration for all of this. He just had such a dry wit, a commanding voice, a great presence. You knew when you were watching it that if something went wrong, you could look to him, and he would steer you through it. It was always with great dignity and a dry sense of humor, and he was sort of out there all the time. He was definitely the ""host."" He definitely helped the show, so I like that. Johnny Carson, too, was great. KF: Hypothetically, what would you do if your name was called for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series this year? NPH: Oh my, I would graciously accept, try to keep my speech to a minimum, and then quickly set it backstage, because I have a lot more to do for the next couple hours. KF: Is the award given out early on in the show? NPH: I think it will be within the first hour. It's a nice and refreshing win-win for me, because if I do happen to win, it will be awesome-tastic, and oddly, a bit of a distraction. And if I don't win, it just provides lots of comedy fodder for the rest of the show. So I'm pretty safe either way. It's a tough category, for sure. KF: So the day after the Emmys, a new season of ""How I Met Your Mother"" premieres. Last season's finale left us wondering if your character, Barney Stinson, will finally settle down and start dating Robin Scherbatsky. NPH: They certainly take a stab at it. I know there will be lots of necking and making out. Lots of canoodling between Robin and I. My lips are chapped. They have strong physical chemistry, apparently. KF: ""How I Met Your Mother"" puts a lot of stake in fate. Are you a believer in fate? NPH: I don't know what to make of fate. I certainly don't think you can predetermine things. It feels like if you go out of your way to try to make something happen, it rarely does. But if you allow for good things to happen, they seem to. I think a lot of that is more perception, you know? A lot of people would take getting rear-ended in their car as an example of why their life continues to be one road block after another, and I think a different person can see that same fender bender and be grateful it wasn't worse. That allows them an opportunity to learn something from it -- sort of take some sort of positive elements from that. I think if you try to angle your life in those ways, then fate, destiny, karma opens itself up to you and allows for more growth. Oprah.com: How to get lucky in love and life . KF: I'm curious, how did your father meet your mother? NPH: They were college, fraternity and sorority sweethearts. This was in Albuquerque. She was in Alpha Chi Omega. And he was in, something Pi? They did the whole, you know, he gave her his pin. She was pinned, and they were a couple. Then, they were married, and they've only been with each other. I'm very extraordinarily lucky with my parents. ... We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but we were never made to feel poor. They had amazing senses of humor, senses of music and really treated us like regular people when we were kids. So I lucked out. KF: Did your parents help you survive child stardom? NPH: They were definitely grounding forces during years in my life that were very tumultuous. They're remarkably grounded and were not at all blinded by the light of stardom and fame. Their main concern was just my well-being and my brother's well-being during all of our crazy times, whether they be intimate or very public. They're remarkable people.

67,"(CNN) -- She hit the big time in the 1980's with Eurythmics and found huge success as a solo artist with her 1992 album ""Diva"", but for singer Annie Lennox, being able to express her passion has always been the motivating factor in whatever she's done. Annie Lennox will continue to SING with her AIDS awareness charity. As a result her musical career has taken a back seat to her political activism and charity work in recent years; most notably with SING her AIDS awareness in Africa charity, as well as working with Amnesty, Save the Children and as a UNICEF ambassador. Yet the 54-year-old maintains that she'll always keep singing as well as working on the other things that she feels passionate about. ""I'm a multi-tasker. I have to do a lot of things at once. I love music. And I want to keep making music. I hope that I'll always be a music-maker and I'll always be an activist,"" she told CNN in Hong Kong. Growing up in Aberdeen, Scotland, Lennox found enormous success with Eurythmics and the 1983 album ""Sweet Dreams"" and single of the same name. It catapulted her to international success and stardom, something she had always wanted, but at first found difficult to adjust to. ""We were really on a whole kind of roller coaster with [Eurythmics], which on the one hand I was very grateful for, and on the other hand, it sort of sucked out your life, any sort of privacy,"" she said. ""Just the ability to be anonymous which I absolutely really value. I love to just to be mixing with people and not have to be the one person in the room with the spotlight and the heads all turning. So that was a little bit hard to adapt to...I might as well have a neon light for a head."" She's sold over 80 million records during a career that has spanned four decades, which she credits to hard graft fueled by an unending passion for music. ""The glamour side to it is what we see as the end result. But all the rest of it is hard work and dedication. And it's not easy always, you have to be very focused. And you have to be really, really motivated to do it. You have to have a kind of yearning, a passion for that. ""I was never thinking, 'Oh, I'm in this for the long haul.' I just think as I'm still thinking, I want to have a life where I'm able to do the thing that makes me feel alive."" Aware of the downsides of a career in music, Lennox also has a greater sense of the perils and pitfall in life, something she has often expressed in her music. ""I have encountered individuals and I've encountered things in the industry that were vile. Bad things happen everywhere. And the music industry and all that surrounds it, is no exception."".

68,"(CNN) -- It says something about the popularity of ""Dancing With the Stars"" that the show's professional dancers have become almost as famous as the celebrities they're paired with. Mark Ballas and Shawn Johnson celebrate after winning last season's ""Dancing With the Stars."" Take Mark Ballas, who last season waltzed and tangoed his way to a first-place finish with Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson -- his second mirror ball trophy since he joined the hit series in 2007. At just 23, Ballas is already recognized on the street, he's in a band with fellow ""Dancing"" pro Derek Hough, and he's thinking about branching out into acting. For the new season of ""Dancing With the Stars,"" which begins Monday, Ballas is paired with Melissa Joan Hart, best known for her roles in the television series ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" and ""Clarissa Explains It All."" Ballas spoke to CNN about his new celebrity partner, his training routine and whether former ""American Idol"" judge Paula Abdul could find a new home on the show. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: What is Melissa Joan Hart like as a dancer? Mark Ballas: She's doing really well so far. I think she's going to shock a lot of people, and I think they will love her personality. She's really bright and bubbly. CNN: Does she have any dancing experience? Ballas: No, she's never danced before. I mean, she took a couple of ballet classes when she was a child, but everyone's done that. She's never danced like this before, so it's been a bit of a learning curve for her, but hopefully she'll smooth it out. CNN: Did you know who she was before you were matched? Ballas: Oh, yeah. I used to watch her shows all the time when I was younger. I would watch ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" after school. CNN: Do you get any input in what celebrity you are paired with? Ballas: No, we get no choice whatsoever. It's basically [dependent on] whether they think our personalities will be compatible and also on height. You have to be the right height, because if someone is 6 feet and your partner is 5 feet, it won't work out. CNN: How do you choreograph dances? Do you like to use certain routines over again? Ballas: I start fresh every time. Having a good song is definitely helpful, and when you get a new song, it's really inspiring and makes you want to move, and that's the fun of it. You always want to keep things fresh, and I always keep challenging myself, like how can I outdo what I did last time? CNN: The facial expressions seem so important in ballroom dancing. How do you teach that to your celebrity partners? Ballas: That's something you can't teach. Obviously, you explain what the dance is and how you have to act and what you should be thinking, but you don't choreograph facial expressions. That's got to come from the heart and the soul, and you just have to feel it. CNN: If you have a celebrity partner like Kim Kardashian, who was criticized for being wooden on the dance floor, is there anything you can do? Ballas: The best thing to do is to make them feel comfortable. Kim got very shy when the cameras were on, and she would always dance a lot better off camera. But sometimes, dancing just isn't for certain people. Kim and I had a great time together and still are good friends to this day. But dancing wasn't her thing, she just didn't take to it. CNN: Do you keep in touch with your former partners? Ballas: Yes, I talk to Shawn [Johnson] and Kristi Yamaguchi all the time; I talked to Kim Kardashian about an hour ago. We stay good friends. Kristi Yamaguchi was amazing to work with -- great temperament, really eager to learn, she was like a machine. Kim Kardashian was a doll. We talk all the time, we hang out when we can, she's a lot of fun. Shawn Johnson was just a joy to work with, from start to finish. Just an absolute sweetheart. We had a lot of fun, we laughed a lot. CNN: A lot of people were surprised that actor Gilles Marini didn't win last season. What's your take on that? Ballas: I definitely feel that Shawn was the better dancer. Gilles was a great performer, but technically -- if you were looking at technique and you're looking at dancing -- Shawn was the stronger dancer. Her routines were a lot harder, her technique was a lot stronger ... especially in the last four weeks. I definitely feel like it was a fair result. CNN: Your father, Corky Ballas, who is also a professional dancer, made quite a splash when he was paired with 80-something Cloris Leachman on ""Dancing"" last year. Is he coming back to the show anytime soon? Ballas: I hope so. It was a lot of fun having him around, and I thought he was amazing, of course. They were a great team, absolutely hilarious. I'm sure if they ask him back, which I'm hoping they do, that he would definitely come back. CNN: There were some suggestions that Paula Abdul might join the show as a judge. What do you think about that? Ballas: I think that Paula would be great as a contestant. If she wanted to be on our show, she should come on to compete and be partnered with one of us. As far as the judges, I love our judges. I think our judges are great, and I think we've got a great system, and I don't think there would be any need for an extra judge. I love Paula -- I've met her several times because ""American Idol"" is right next door to us. I would love for her to come on the show and be my partner. CNN: Are you recognized on the street? Ballas: I have loads of people come up to me. They ask questions about the season. It's really nice, and I really appreciate it. CNN: Your fellow pros on ""Dancing,"" Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Karina Smirnoff, broke off their engagement recently. Is that going to affect the show in any way? Ballas: We're all very professional. These things happen. It will definitely not affect the show, we'll keep on dancing. You won't even be able to tell. I've talked to Max several times. He's doing OK. These things are never easy, and Max is a dear, dear friend of mine. I've known him for 13 years. CNN: What are your career goals beyond dancing? Ballas: I'm actually a guitar player and a singer/songwriter. I studied musical theater and music and vocals. Anything to do with music is definitely a big goal of mine. I've studied acting for 10 years, so I'd love to do film at some point as well.",0.63226,8272

Best known for his novels ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy,"" both of which were turned into movies (as was his memoir, ""Fever Pitch""), Hornby's latest novel, ""Juliet, Naked,"" released in the United Kingdom on September 1, has just been released in the United States. It focuses on an American singer-songwriter, Tucker Crowe, who still rests on the success he saw with one album in the 1980s, an obsessed English fan, Duncan, and his exasperated girlfriend, Annie. Hornby's love for music has inspired more than plotlines. It has fueled a partnership with the rock band Marah and other projects, which recently included penning the lyrics for Ben Folds' ""Levi Johnston's Blues."" Meanwhile, Hornby is also the force behind the screenplay of the critically acclaimed film-festival darling, ""An Education,"" which will be released in New York and Los Angeles on October 9. CNN spoke with Hornby about how he develops the characters for his books, the challenges of writing in a woman's voice and his own prowess in relationships. CNN: Your newest novel, ""Juliet, Naked,"" seems to revisit the kind of character that anchored ""High Fidelity,"" the obsessive, somewhat dysfunctional music fan. What is it about this type that had you coming back, and how have the years changed this character? Hornby: Well, I conceived them as being different. Rob in ""High Fidelity,"" he wasn't the obsessive. It was the people around him. This one [Duncan] is one of three characters; he's the nerdy obsessive. ... The Internet's changed everything. There are no record stores to hang out in anymore. Ten or 15 years ago, he [Duncan] wouldn't have found anyone to talk to. And nobody's career [character Tucker Crowe's included] is allowed to die. Way back, obsessives had to admit other interests into their lives. These people don't have to really do anything like that.  Watch the author talk about music, comedy and relationships » . CNN: Your books, and now your screenplay, are so rich in complicated and incredibly flawed characters who, in turn, have complicated and flawed relationships. How much of what they struggle with is autobiographical? Are there aspects to these characters that are reflections of you? Hornby: I think sometimes there are. I have three kids by two moms. Tucker has five kids by four women. But my experience is relatively ordinary. My relationships are fairly stable. A lot of this is trying to write comedy, and complicated relationships are funnier than straightforward ones. CNN: At times, for instance in your book ""How to Be Good,"" you've narrated as a woman. What are the challenges of taking on a woman's voice? Hornby: Anytime the narrator is someone who is not you, the challenge is equal. The challenge is to make people laugh. My last book, ""Slam,"" was for young adults, and I had to write as a 16-year-old boy. Of course, it makes me more nervous writing as a woman. I just made sure every woman I knew read the narrative as soon as I finished. But no woman speaks for all women. CNN: You've been open about having a son, now 16, who is autistic. How much, if at all, has that informed your writing when it comes to getting into the heads of kids and adolescents in, for example, ""About a Boy?"" Hornby: It hasn't. Not yet. The experience of fathering a child like that is so different, but I think you have to be very careful about how you use it and how it affects other people. CNN: Your screenplay for ""An Education,"" which is based on an autobiographical essay by British journalist Lynn Barber, was first recognized at the Sundance Film Festival in January and continues to get critical acclaim. How has this creative journey differed from the one you're used to traveling in the book publishing world? Hornby: The process is incredibly different. With movies, it always feels like such a long shot getting it made. With books, you write and talk about it with your editor. With movies, you need the money, the cast, the director -- I felt much more confused by the the movie-making process. CNN: But with movies, the insecurities you might have about your own work as an artist, as a writer, are helped by others. It's not all on you, right? Hornby: Yes. I can look at the film and take pride in other people's work.",0.6215077,6639
70,"(CNN)  -- He burst on the music scene in the 1970s with the Commodores and then went on to a major solo career with hits such as ""All Night Long"" and ""Hello."" Lionel Richie and his daughter, Nicole, gave their first joint TV interview in six years to CNN's Larry King. She made a name for herself on the TV series ""The Simple Life,"" which followed the exploits of her and fellow socialite Paris Hilton, and in the tabloids. Father-and-daughter Lionel and Nicole Richie have been making news for decades, but rarely together. In their first TV interview together in six years, they talked with CNN's Larry King about their relationship; her time in rehab; Lionel's first grandchild, Harlow; their growing family; and more. The following interview, scheduled to air Thursday night, has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: You did ""American Idol."" A European tour. A new CD. You ever give thoughts of just cooling it? Lionel Richie: My answer to that is very simple. I don't like fishing. I'm pretty much like you. This is my hobby. King: What's the new album [""Just Go""] about? Lionel Richie: You know what I decided to do on this album? Something different. Instead of controlling, which is what I love to do -- I'm the writer, I'm the arranger, I'm the producer, I'm the singer -- I decided [to] start another way. I just gave up the power completely. There is only one song on this album that I actually wrote, called ""Eternity."" King: The ""American Idol"" thing. Was that fun? Why did you do it? Lionel Richie: It's the best fun in the world. Danny [Gokey] was so wonderful. He kept saying, ""Suppose I mess up or suppose I sing your line instead of my line,"" and I said, ""You can't mess this one up. And if you feel like you want to sing my part, sing it loud and strong."" And of course he nailed it. It was so much fun to watch everybody backstage. The tension of what goes through that show, I don't think I [could] do it. [Nicole Richie joins the interview] . King: What is it like to be with her in this setting? Lionel Richie: I'm so proud of her right now. There is such a pride that she has turned this corner. She is an amazing mother. I want the world to know where she is. King: Now you're pregnant with a second child, right? Nicole Richie: Yes, yes I am. King: And the father [Joel Madden] is the same? Nicole Richie: Yes. King: You going to get married? Nicole Richie: Eventually, yes. King: But that's not important or paramount? Nicole Richie: I think for both of us, we are going to do it because we want to, not because that's what you do. King: What kind of grandfather is he? Nicole Richie: Well, he's very animated. He smiles like this all the time, and so he's nothing but fun for Harlow. She absolutely loves him.  Watch Nicole Richie talk about her daughter » . King: Nicole, you've been through some turbulent times. You've had drug abuse, wild-child behavior. Entered rehab in 2003. How have you come through all of that? Nicole Richie: With the support of my family, really. I've always stayed really close with my mother [Brenda] and my father. I have really great friends. And I just have a really great circle around me who support me no matter what, don't judge me no matter how low I've ever gotten. King: How did you deal with it, Lionel? Lionel Richie: It gave me an amazing opportunity to step up to the plate. I said to her one day: I have some good news and I have some bad news. I said the bad news is that Nicole is going to die. The good news is, she doesn't have to. I remember that look on her face of sheer panic. And I said the only person who is going to be able to save Nicole is Nicole. And she went away and about three weeks later I got a phone saying, 'Dad, I want to go into rehab.' And when she checked into rehab, her mother and I checked into rehab with her. King: What was the toughest part about rehab? Nicole Richie: It was right before ""The Simple Life"" came out. Just the fact that I couldn't do it in private really was unfortunate. But we didn't watch TV there or [had no] connection to the outside world, which I thought was really great. So I just focused on being positive there and focused on myself. And my parents were there with me. They came for family week. And so I just focused on that and everything just kind of fell in place.  Watch Nicole Richie talk about rehab » . King: When all of those troubles were going on, didn't it affect [your] performance? Lionel Richie: Thank God for the stage. What the stage was for me was an outlet. It gave me a chance to kind of get away from it for a moment. King: You said that you were not a good dad to Nicole growing up ... wasn't there for her. Do you regret that? Lionel Richie: I was trying to be Lionel Richie. There is a part of [me] that's guilty because I wish I could have been there more for her, but I was trying to make it as the solo guy at that time. King: What kind of dad was he? Nicole Richie: I really hate when he says that. I hate when he says that he wasn't a good dad because my memory of my childhood was nothing but good memories. I remember him coming down in the kitchen in the morning and singing songs and us playing. Was he gone a lot? Yeah. But he also toured a lot. Even when he and my mom divorced, it was kind of like he was on tour, so I was kind of OK with it. And he's not perfect, he's a human and we went through phases of not speaking. I could sit here and I could say that I was a terrible daughter, too, but I am not going to say that. King: How do you like her boyfriend [Joel Madden]? Lionel Richie: Love him. Love him. King: Don't you want them to get married? Lionel Richie: I want them to take their time. I'm more interested in whether they like each other and whether they're best friends. Because that means they'll be great parents forever. King [to Nicole]: You were adopted. Nicole Richie: Yes. Lionel Richie: When we adopted, [she] was 8, yes. When we first met her, she was 3 1/2. King: Took five years? Lionel Richie: She stayed with us for two years before we even thought about legal guardianship. King: Was there a doubt about doing it? Lionel Richie: It was a tremendous responsibility, but I fell in love. Brenda fell in love. And once you fall in love, you don't know anything else.",0.6169902,5689
72,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Derek Mears has a big hockey mask to fill. Derek Mears arrives on the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of the new ""Friday the 13th"" movie. Mears was cast as the iconic boogeyman Jason Voorhees in the new ""Friday the 13th"" movie. A remake of the original 1980 film, the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious Camp Crystal Lake. Mears is no stranger to the horror genre, having co-starred in ""The Hills Have Eyes II."" His career is extensive and includes stints as a stuntman in two of the popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. He recently spoke to CNN about taking a turn as the ultimate evil, the thrill of continuing a slasher legacy and why he's really not that bloody nice. CNN: You aren't that scary in person, so what made you think you could be that scary on camera? Derek Mears: I've got a lot of issues. I've got a whole lot of daddy issues. No, I sound like a basket case. It's funny with acting -- we all wear masks in our normal life. Not to sound like a weirdo in the hockey mask, but like right now I'm really excited about the film and excited about playing the character, and I will start to speak faster. That's kind of what's coming over me: ""Oh you're, you're really nice,"" but ... on the other side of me there are other Dereks that are angry, and like I said before, have a little bit of issues. CNN: Tell me a little bit about how you were approached. Did you know they were making it before they came to you? Was it kind of a shock? Mears: It's so weird. There's two different versions. There's my version of how it went about, and there's the producer's version. I'll tell the producer's version because my version is really, really long. The short version of my version was I heard they were doing a new ""Friday the 13th,"" and I've never tried to pursue a role before and I went, I really want to do this. So when I heard they were doing it, before I even had an audition, I started training for it. I found out a little about what they wanted for the character -- that he wasn't going to be super, you know bulky or big, that he's more functional. He's still big, but he's lean. So I started training that way and trying to do what I could just to get an audition. On the other end, on the producer's end, they asked a bunch of different industry professionals. They said, ""Hey, were doing a new 'Friday the 13th.' Who do you think would be a great new Jason?"" And my name kept popping up, which I'm blown away by. They brought me in for an audition, and I met with them. and they called me the next day and went, ""OK, you're the guy."" And I still don't believe it till this day. I'm blown away. CNN: How did you keep it light on the set? Mears: Believe it or not, all the actors ... got along so well. I have never been so close to a cast before on set. We were just goofing around and playing, but then when it's time to work and get serious with certain scenes, we'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to. CNN: Had you seen any of the original ""Friday the 13th"" movies? Mears: Oh yeah. I mean, I'm a fan. I consider myself a fan of the series. I already knew all of the originals. I had them all on DVD, and when I first met with Platinum Dunes [the production company behind the new movie], I told them, ""Hey look, I'm a fan of the series first and foremost. If I'm right for the part, fantastic. If I'm not right for the part, that's OK, too. I, just as a fan, want to see a good 'Friday the 13th' film. I want to see the series continue so if I can help it, awesome, but I just want to see something good."" CNN: Did you try to model your character after previous Jasons, or did you try to kind of take it and make it your own? Mears: Definitely make it my own. I used the script that Mark Swift and Damian Shannon wrote as a blueprint -- like you would for any acting role where I knew the other guys who've played ""Jason"" before, and what they've done, but you kind of shove that away somewhere deep in your brain and build your character from the new script. And there are times in the film here and there where I would do little tips of the hats or little homage for the guys who have played him before. CNN: It's kind of a dream come true. Mears: Yeah, that's why I keep saying the words this whole interview like ""unbelievable,"" unbelievable because I don't believe it. CNN: Which is funny. You don't usually think of such happiness and glee [on a horror movie set]. Mears: And trust me, you won't see that in the final product.

73,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- This year, the Oscars are on Hugh Jackman's shoulders. Hugh Jackman plans to offer viewers ""a good time"" at the Oscars. He hosts the big show Sunday night. The Australian actor, who earned rave reviews for his hosting of the Tonys, now has the Academy Awards to contend with. It's a job that's put Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Whoopi Goldberg and David Letterman on the firing line, with only Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson emerging more or less unscathed in the last couple of decades. But with typical verve -- after all, this is the guy who won a Tony for playing song-and-dance man Peter Allen in ""The Boy from Oz"" -- Jackman cracks jokes about the task, telling ABC that one of his distinctions is that he's the ""tallest"" Oscar host in recent years. To CNN's Brooke Anderson, he was equally at ease. ""Ultimately, the way I see it is if I'm not going to have a good time, then how can anyone else have a good time,"" he said.  Watch Hugh Jackman talk about doing it the Australian way » . Even if he's not having a good time, you may not want to get in his way. After all, this is the guy who's played the fearsome, sharp-clawed Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies and gets a solo turn as the superhero in the forthcoming ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" Jackman talked with Anderson about musical numbers, Heath Ledger and performing ""drunk and nude."" The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Are you feeling any nerves, or is it just pure excitement at this point? Hugh Jackman: It's more, it is more excitement. I'm not impervious ... there has been moments in my life where I've been nervous going on stage, that's for sure, and I know I'll have a butterfly or two, cause yeah, you wanna have a couple. But ultimately, the way I see it is if I'm not going to have a good time, then how can anyone else have a good time. You know, you're the host -- it's not really about you. Ultimately, it's your job to set the tone.  Watch Hollywood prepare for the Oscars » . CNN: And the butterflies give you a little bit of adrenaline, I would expect. Jackman: Yeah, and I'll be drinking from about 9 a.m., so that's why I'm impervious. CNN: Now you're a triple threat [a dancer, actor and singer]. I need confirmation on a couple of things. Are you doing a musical number with Beyonce? Jackman: Oh, that's a good question. Look, I'm old school, I don't want to give too much away. But I didn't fully deny it, did I? There's going to be some surprises, that's for sure. CNN: Stars of ""High School Musical"" as well? Jackman: OK, I'll give you that. Yes, they're going to be up on stage. CNN: This is really a reinvention of the Oscars this year. The ratings have been low. Traditionally a comedian hosts the show. How do you feel about being part of the reinvention this year? Jackman: I'm thrilled and honored, and that's honestly how I feel. I don't worry about the ratings or anything like that. I'm really excited by what is planned for the night, and I can tell you it's different. It really is different. I mean having someone as tall as me is a big change. ... It's really not going to be funny at all. No, but there's so many things I love about what they're doing with the show. Forget ratings, you should always reinvent -- you should always be doing something different. What this night is going to be about is spontaneity. We're going to set an atmosphere that will allow things to happen that you won't expect. And the other thing that I and the creators wanted to keep at the top and forefront of the night is that it should only happen on that night -- whatever happens, it could only happen on Oscar night, and only this year will it happen. So there's going to be some things in there where you're like, ""Oh!"" CNN:  How daring is it going to be? Will there be YouTube moments where people will be talking about the Oscars this year after it happens? Jackman: One of my favorite moments at the Oscars was when the streaker came across David Niven. And we're upping it a level and we're just going to do most of the show naked. Um, well, there hopefully will be YouTube moments. CNN: ""The sexiest man alive"" [is] going to be up there nude? Jackman: Drunk and nude, yes. So that's our new fresh approach. It's the Australian way. CNN: Are you going to work that ""sexiest man alive"" title into the show? Jackman: There's a few jokes floating around. Of course I will be about 8 feet away from two-time sexiest man alive Brad Pitt, so yes, there's great temptation to use something there. CNN: And political jokes -- will there be many of them that you will work into the act? Jackman: Hmm ... there may be some, but it won't be top-heavy. CNN: OK, so lots of surprises. You've got experience with award shows, how is this different than hosting the Tonys? Jackman: The Tony Awards is watched by more people in the theater than at home on television. So, the Oscars, it's slightly different, there's about a thousand here [in the theater] and a billion out there. But really, if I hadn't done the Tony Awards, I'd be a hell of a lot more nervous. I mean I'm trained as an actor, that's what I do, it's not like I'm trained to be a host. But having done that, the thing that I think surprised me more than anything was how much fun I had because anything can happen. You're always amongst people who are, they're pros. There's people out there, and if you played with them, they'll generally play back, and that's the thing I like about it. CNN: Heath Ledger was a fellow Australian. Do you think [it will] be a fitting tribute for him to posthumously win an Oscar? Jackman: You know of course, I can't help [but] feel sentimentally for him to be recognized. I think everyone recognizes his talent, his contributions. He was a friend of mine -- I knew him -- so I would love him to get that kind of public recognition. His family will be there; I can't help but feel that will be great. So that's the only category that I will give my preferences. I have a few others. I've had a few little sly bets going. I've got to talk to all those people backstage: Hey, I thought you should have won! CNN: How do you balance your home life with your busy schedule? Jackman: You abandon your family at this point in time. Literally, they're in New York. People have said, ""Oh, is the family coming out?"" and I've said [to my family] don't bother coming -- I leave at about 7 in the morning and I get home at about 11 at night, so right now it's Skype. God bless Skype. CNN: The kids are understanding? Jackman: Yeah, they're cool. My son, who's named Oscar by the way, he goes, ""You know what the headline should be? 'Oscar's dad hosts the Oscars.' "" And I was like, that's pretty good. Yeah, he'll stay up and watch it. iReport.com: Who do you think will win at the Oscars?",0.60574883,2538
74,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- As the man in the Dodgers jersey walked quickly around the perimeter of the infield, fans poured down from the bleachers begging for autographs. Pitbull says he learns from setbacks: ""Usually the negatives turned out to be the most positive for me."" No, it wasn't home run king Manny Ramirez. It was Armando Christian Perez, the Cuban-American rapper better known as Pitbull. In five years, he's gone from a mouthy Miami street hustler to a chart-topping hip-hop star whose infectious Caribbean beats have enticed crossover audiences to swing their hips and sing along -- even taking on some of the words in Spanish. His fourth studio album, ""Rebelution,"" debuted in the Top 10 on the mainstream Billboard chart. But Pitbull's growing profile means nada as he takes the mound to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the game. ""I'm the only Cuban who never picked up a baseball in his life,"" he said, preparing. He awkwardly winds up and releases the pitch. It falls short, bouncing on the ground before reaching the plate. ""One more try!"" he signals. The second attempt is closer to the mark. It's symbolic of Pit's career. ""It's not how you start. It's how you finish it,"" he likes to say.  Watch how Pitbull leads his ""Rebelution"" » . Tommy Lasorda, the legendary Dodgers manager, is waiting to bust his chops as he leaves the infield. Later, we get the scoop on the conversation. (By the way, the Dodgers won that game.) CNN: Tommy Lasorda was out there giving you a little bit of grief. Pitbull: Tommy Lasorda told me, ""It was the worst throw I've ever seen in my life!"" I said, ""Well, I'll throw you in the studio. You rap, I'll play baseball."" He goes, ""I'll rap a whole lot better than that throw!"" (Laughs) CNN: How much do you deflect things with humor? Pitbull: [Humor is] everything. Everything. Usually the negatives turned out to be the most positive for me. In the music industry, any other artist would have looked at the situation I was in and thought, ""Oh man, this is not for me."" I looked at it more like [Darwin exploring] the Galápagos Islands. You know -- survival of the fittest. CNN: Were you a troublemaker growing up? Pitbull: Not a troublemaker. I'm sharp. Slick, if you want to call it. What the street taught me how to do is how to hustle. How to make something out of nothing. CNN: In the music industry, street cred may help an artist. Pitbull: Anybody who's made it out of the street -- they want to do this (places index finger over his lips). Shh. CNN: Even though some of the struggles are similar, there doesn't seem to be a lot of crossover between African-American hip-hop artists and Latin-American hip-hop artists. Pitbull: You can't get a Diddy or Jay-Z to speak to the Latins. It's not gonna happen. There's a force field where they said, ""OK, we're going to let you here -- but that's it."" Diddy got the closest. Why? Because he had J. Lo. The only reason my grandmother knows Puff Daddy is because of J. Lo. But he couldn't cross that barrier. So as far as myself -- I guess I'm their role model. CNN: How much do you want to cross over? Pitbull: I have respect for Jay-Z and Diddy for what they did in the hip-hop game. But I want to be Celia Cruz. I want to be Gloria Estefan [both were born in Cuba]. I want to enterprise -- open clubs and restaurants. They've done it also -- but those are who I look up to. CNN: Your parents were both born in Cuba. Pitbull: They didn't want to leave Cuba! They would have stayed in Cuba. They didn't want to get out of there. There were forced out of that country. CNN: How did they come to Miami? Pitbull: My grandmother fought in the [Cuban] revolutionary war actually with Castro, because everybody thought that Batista was corrupt. I'm not saying that he wasn't, but it's almost like the lesser of two evils. [When she became disillusioned with the Castro government], my mother and my aunt got sent off in an operation called Peter Pan without their parents. She didn't see her mother for seven years. As far as my father -- he came over also. He didn't come in the Peter Pan, but they fled the country. CNN: Would you ever go to Cuba and play a concert there? Pitbull: No way. I'd never go to Cuba and play a concert. [I'd consider playing there] as soon as I know that it's confirmed that Castro's out of there. I mean, if you ask me, I think Castro's been dead for years. He handed power to Raúl, and he slips pictures here and there. He keeps giving these pictures to the media with the same shirt on -- same jacket, same everything. CNN: How do you feel about other artists of your generation who feel compelled to go and perform in Cuba as kind of an olive branch? Pitbull: Juanes just did it. Papa, you can't change Cuba. History will tell you that you can't change Cuba. I respect him as an artist -- he's like U2, the Bono of Spanish. I don't respect his decision. Maybe he doesn't really understand it at the end of the day because he's not Cuban. [Juanes is Colombian.] . But to each his own. There's too much suffering, too much pain from people who left that island, that have come over here and tried to change their life. CNN: Even though you were born in America, how much are you influenced by your Cuban roots? Pitbull: My mother, she's like, ""Look, you're American, son. You were born here in the States."" My father? My father said, ""You're Cuban-American."" My mother would call me Chris, because my middle name's Christian. My father would say, ""No, your name's Armando."" But in my blood, what it tells me is, ""You're Cuban-American."" The music is what makes you, the food is what makes you, the way you've been taught mentally.",0.60066175,7351
76,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- In her first television interview since Mel Gibson went public with their relationship in April, his girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, made it clear to CNN: ""I'd like to be known for my music."" Oksana Grigorieva and Mel Gibson are expecting a child this year. Still, the 39-year-old singer was willing to talk about her beau and her pregnancy, as well as her new album, ""Beautiful Heartache."" ""Beautiful Heartache"" was released to iTunes on July 23 by Icon Distribution, Gibson's company, which up until now has handled only soundtracks for his movies. ""He's an incredible artist,"" Grigorieva said. ""A visionary. He enabled me to produce this album, for my music to live."" The Oscar-winning (""Braveheart"") filmmaker also directed four music videos for Grigorieva during a whirlwind week in Mexico.  Watch Grigorieva talk about Gibson, love » . ""They're like dramatic miniature films -- a whirlpool of different, exciting, bright images. That's quite rare,"" she said. The music videos and music are available on her Web site, www.oksana.fm. Grigorieva has a background in music. She said she was classically trained as a pianist in her native Russia, and both her parents are musicians. In 2006, a song she penned called ""Un Dia Llegara"" was recorded by Josh Groban for his album ""Awake."" Though she describes her album as being about ""different facets of love,"" she cautions that listeners shouldn't overthink the lyrics. ""This album is not autobiographical -- maybe only partially so. It's not a diary."" Gibson, 53, and his wife of nearly 30 years, Robyn, filed for divorce in April. The two have seven children. Grigorieva and Gibson were first photographed together on the set of his movie ""Edge of Darkness,"" according to People magazine. Grigorieva is pregnant with Gibson's child and is to give birth this year. She said the couple has opted not to learn the sex of the child. It will be her second child, after Alexander, her 12-year-old son with actor Timothy Dalton. ""I'm already buying things in gender-neutral colors. It's very cute,"" she chuckled. Alexander, she added, is excited about having a sibling. ""He's like a little man, protecting me. He's looking forward to it very much."" Grigorieva says she and Gibson have no immediate plans for marriage. ""We don't know yet. We haven't really talked about it,"" she admitted. She acknowledged that her relationship with Gibson has given her a unique opportunity to present her skills. ""If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful,"" she said. ""You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all."" In the meantime, Grigorieva is adapting to life in the public eye. ""It hasn't been too bad, actually. There was a period of time where it was a little bit difficult, but now it's much better,"" she said. Before embarking on limited press for the new album, Gibson did offer a few words of advice, she added: ""Just be myself and speak the truth. What I most like to talk about is my music and 'Beautiful Heartache.' And that's pretty much it.""",0.5995307,7182
77,"(CNN) -- Imagine arriving at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia, one of the busiest and most bustling airports in the country. People are dashing about, waiting at checkpoints and scanning the screens for departure and arrival times. Invariably there are delays and since you aren't going anywhere anytime soon, you might as well enjoy the tunes playing over the public announcement system. Hey, isn't that the Peaches and Herb classic ""Shake Your Groove Thing""? You haven't heard that in years! But wait, what are they singing? It sounds like ""Shake Your Groove Thing,"" but the lyrics playing don't match the ones you know. Click on the image above to hear two of the airport's new songs. ""Opening Day fresh, Opening Day fresh, . Yeah, yeah . Hartsfield-Jackson do it now . Opening Day fresh, Opening Day fresh, . Yeah, yeah . Show 'em how we do it now! Show 'em how we do it now!"" Welcome to parody with a purpose. As part of an initiative to keep the airport clean and get people excited about the airport's new shops and dining options, officials there bought the rights to three popular R & B classics: ""Shake Your Groove Thing"" by Peaches and Herb, ""Bustin' Loose"" by Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers and ""Fantastic Voyage"" by Lakeside. With rights secured, Doug Strachan, Creative Innovations Manager for the City of Atlanta Department of Aviation, rewrote the lyrics and invited the original artists to record the revamped songs. ""Whereas words reach the mind, music reaches the heart,"" Strachan said. ""These are hit songs that people love ... real powerful, catchy and make you want to dance. If you can make someone dance, you can probably motivate them to do other things."" So ""Groove Thing"" became ""Keep It Opening Day Fresh,"" ""Bustin Loose"" morphed into ""We're Steady Cleaning Up,"" and ""Fantastic Voyage"" was reborn as ""Our New Concessions."" Clean music with a clean message -- literally. The concept of ""opening day fresh"" refers to keeping the airport as clean as if it were opening day, which means smelling fresh and looking as spotless as possible. The catchy tunes are a way to subtly remind visitors that it takes a team effort to keep the airport sparkling. ""Our New Concessions"" reminds travelers about the facility's retail offerings and food service. Strachan said much effort was put into making sure the songs were produced in such a way that they were respectful to the song and the artist. ""The whole idea is to make it sound as much like the original as possible,"" Strachan said. ""If it's not really done with deft, then it kind of detracts from it rather than enhances it."" Herb Fame, half of Peaches and Herb, loved the idea and was pleased to remake his classic. ""Shake Your Grove Thing"" ""was a worldwide song and people recognize the melody,"" said Fame, who continues to perform. ""It was fun to do and every time I come through the airport I listen to it."" Mark Wood, lead vocalist of the group Lakeside, said Strachan did a great job transforming ""Fantastic Voyage"" into a new, yet familiar song. ""It's important to send the message in a way that the message will get through,"" Wood said. ""Ours is a song that people may have grown up hearing or they may have played for their kids and so you might have generations that can relate to it."" Such messaging can be extremely effective, said Matt Wallaert, lead scientist for Thrive, an online financial advisory company for young adults. Wallaert, an expert in behavioral finance and social psychology, said the airport is obviously attempting to do something his company also aims for -- offering useful information in a way that is less stressful for the user. ""If you put up a sign that says 'Don't Litter,' people see it the first time you put it up, but every time after that it loses its impact, because it becomes a standard part of what they see,"" he said. ""Music is pervasive in a way that a sign is not because it's everywhere."" Strachan said officials at the airport definitely want those coming through to enjoy their time. As part of that, the airport recently launched the initial phases of a program that uses a scent called ""Breeze"" to help enhance visitors' mood. Strachan said the scent, which was first tested on a limited group of passengers, uses a variety of different notes, including vanilla and a little lavender. The pleasant, relaxing scent is going over so well that Strachan said a custom scent that will be exclusive to Hartsfield-Jackson is being developed. ""We want to make people feel better,"" he said. ""We wanted to give them an olfactory cue which suggested that the airport is opening day fresh and we want to enhance their travel experience."" Stefanie Michaels, also known as Adventure Girl, is a travel commentator and writer who is a frequent traveler. Anything airports can do to make air travel more relaxing is more than welcome, especially in the times we live in, she said. ""Movie theaters and restaurants have been using scents and those kinds of subliminal tactics for years,"" Michaels said. ""Music makes people feel good and with the economy the way it is, people are just stressed to no end, so from a subconscious level it's a really wise thing for the airport to do.""",0.5985739,4811
78,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- They first met in the autumn of 1979; she playing the role of the lovelorn terrorist, he dressed as a rather sloppy Ayatollah Khomeini. Pamela Stephenson first met Billy Connolly on the set of a comedy show in 1979. They married in Fiji in 1990. It may not have been love at first sight on the set of British comedy show ""Not the Nine O'Clock News,"" but love, marriage and children eventually followed. Australian comedienne, now psychotherapist, Pamela Stephenson, describes being captivated by Billy Connolly's wildman looks, his mane of grey hair and devil-may-care demeanor. She tells CNN's Revealed about her first impressions of her husband, his unique ability to keep audiences entertained and what she learnt about his addictions and childhood abuse while writing his best-selling biography, ""Billy."" CNN: Take us back to the beginning. How did you meet Billy Connolly? Pamela Stephenson: I'm not quite sure what Billy's version of how we met is like because he was very drunk. I met him when I was a performer on ""Not The Nine O'Clock News"" and he was a guest. He was just shaggy and some kind of terrible beastie. But I was attracted to him immediately, maybe because he was so unusual. I think what I picked up on was his dichotomy -- that beastiness and the underlying sensitivity that he has. I think that's something that audiences relate to, you're aware of all the toughness, but underneath you just know that there's philosophy and this poetic, Celtic nature that speaks to people. Also his pain, his underlying sadness and the pain of his childhood ... when I first met him I think I connected with that. He played the Ayatollah Khomeini in a scene on ""Not The Nine O'Clock News"" and I played a demented fan singing a love song to him, it was in days when you could do stuff like that, I suppose. And then we did an interview, I pretending to be British TV personality Janet Street-Porter, with giant fake teeth which kept falling out. Of course, he could never keep a straight face; I thought he was dreadfully unprofessional because he just kept laughing, especially when my teeth fell out -- my fake teeth --  fell out. CNN: What's it like being married to him? PS: People always think that being married to Billy means that I get non-stop Billy Connolly concerts. It's not nearly as exciting as that, although he's adorable. But it's boring sometimes and he would say the same. There are moments when I wish he would go and make me a cup of tea, which he does very often. Actually, Billy is quite a quiet person. He's a little reclusive and I don't think it's necessarily his personality. With the highs he experiences on stage he needs to be very quiet when he's not.  Billy Connolly takes CNN's Revealed on a tour of his home » . CNN: What made you write a biography of his life? Was it the first time he opened up about his childhood? PS: When I wrote ""Billy,"" it was the first time that Billy really looked at his childhood in a chronological order and with depth. It was a painful process, but cathartic. The book gave me the opportunity to understand a lot more about him. Just putting some of this together, the sexual abuse, for example, that he received from his father, the physical abuse he received from his aunts, helped me understand why there's a part of him that's very closed off.  Watch Billy recall his troubled childhood » . His learning disability was never understood. Now we'd call it an attention disorder. In those days, he had difficulty concentrating, for which he was beaten and taunted at school. People told him he was stupid and to this day there's a part of him that thinks that's he's not as clever as other people and yet he is absolutely brilliant. He's incredibly well-read and very erudite. CNN: Can you tell us about Billy's problems with alcohol and drugs and how you helped him? PS: Billy was extremely famous in Scotland, and you know what happens, especially with people who don't think they are very worthy. As with Billy, they don't handle fame because they don't feel they deserve it and they'll turn to alcohol and drugs. It became very serious and by the time I met him he was on a very self-destructive path. At first, that was appealing to me, but later I realized I can't be with somebody like that because I don't want to watch him destroy himself. I didn't tell him, ""You've gotta clean up your act,"" I just said I can't deal with this. I discovered you can't make anyone stop drinking or stop taking drugs, you have to just protect yourself and if they want to jump on the good train, they will. Fortunately it worked. CNN: How would you describe Billy's style of comedy? PS: Billy doesn't have a style, because to have a style it would mean that there have to be other people with a similar way of working. He goes on stage and it's like he's got these comedy angels whispering in his ear. He makes this extraordinary connection with the audience, and of course he's very astute and funny about politics. He sees the funny side of all kinds of things -- human nature, human behavior, world events, politicians. He'll talk about that with such passion. It's what many of us think but don't want to say. Billy will see something on television or notice something on the street or he'll just think something and it'll go into his computer of a brain and it'll stumble out when he's on stage.  See Billy Connolly perform on a recent tour of Ireland » . CNN: Is he the same person on and off stage? PS: He's honest and real. He's a man of the people, a working class hero. It's a cliché, but people know that he has struggled; they know he's come from the tough part of Glasgow. Billy just loves an audience, he loves speaking to people if they're nice to him, and they usually are. When he's finished his show, he doesn't go home. He stays in his dressing room and people will come and see him and he'll talk to them for another hour. CNN: He says he's getting more and more nervous when he goes on stage -- have you noticed a change? PS: I don't think he's getting more nervous. At his age, maybe he thinks that it should have become easier -- well, it's not going to become easier. It's incredibly tough to go on stage in front of four or five thousand people and sustain [their interest] by yourself. And one thing that really impresses me, again as a psychologist, is that I think he is really healing. I think that people really have the opportunity to just laugh like that and it's so good for you. I feel fantastic when I go to one of his shows and come out and I'm just sick with laughter. CNN: How does he feel when he comes off stage? He says it can be tough and envies the audience. They can go home and forget about it. PS: Most performers struggle with the letdown after a show, and Billy's no exception. It's tough because it takes time for adrenalin to leave the system. That's actually one reason why a lot of comedians turn to alcohol, because it's a depressant and takes you down. Now that Billy doesn't drink he's found another way -- he goes back to his hotel and stays quiet. Sometimes he likes to eat after the show but not very often. He will just want to veg out, watch TV. Playing his banjo is a great way for him to relax.  Watch a rare performance of Billy on banjo » . He doesn't like me being around when he's touring because he just likes to do his thing. I want to have some food or go and do something. He becomes a bit of a hermit, and that's appropriate for someone who expends that amount of energy and brainpower on stage. CNN: Billy says he finds the routine of touring increasingly tough -- do you think he will stop soon? PS: When Billy's touring, he'll say, ""Oh I don't want to tour anymore, I've had enough it's too hard on the road."" But the truth is, when he's not touring, he wants to go back. It's probably his happiest time. I have been a comedian so I know a little bit about what it's like to be on stage and know that when things are working fantastically, and you're getting that appreciation from the audience. It is an incredible high. It's pretty hard for me as a wife or us as a family or any of his fans or friends to match up to that kind of adulation and so, you know, he deserves it and I have to remind him that it is a lot of fun for him. CNN: How would you describe his dress sense? PS: Billy is a fashion maven. He spends most of his time in New York now so, you know, the New York ""Black is the new black"" is ... that's got to him a bit. He's influenced by Rock 'n' Roll and Vivienne Westwood and edgy stuff. But he just puts it together in his own unique way. He also takes great pride in his body. His closet is still extremely fun. It's far more colorful than mine. I have grey and black suits and things for work -- he loves colorful shirts. It will be a shame if he tones himself down, but I don't think that will happen. He borrows my clothes sometimes, if he sees something particularly mad. We used to say, ""First up, best dressed,"" which is the Glasgow expression for a particularly fun brooch or hat.",0.59850836,1218
80,"(CNN) -- This is the summer of Auto-Tune. The Gregory Brothers have become a viral hit with their ""Auto-Tune the News"" videos. No matter how hard some people -- notably Jay-Z --have tried to kill the trend of musicians using computers to make their voices sound like whiny robots, Auto-Tune technology continues to ride a cultural high. Now the voice-altering effects are migrating from recording studios to YouTube and mobile phones. An iPhone app called ""I Am T-Pain"" lets people manipulate their voices to sound like the popular rapper and Auto-Tune advocate. The Gregory Brothers, a sibling band out of Brooklyn, New York, has become a hit on YouTube with a series of videos that Auto-Tune cable newscasts and political speeches. The group, which also tours as a low-fi soul band, started its series of videos called ""Auto-Tune the News"" during the 2008 presidential debates and has gained millions of fans in recent months. CNN spoke with Andrew Gregory, a 27-year-old member of the band, about the popularity of Auto-Tune -- the trademarked name for the popular pitch-correction software -- and the role of technology in music and society. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation: . Why do you think your videos have taken off like they have? I think with any sort of viral video there's a little bit of luck involved. So we're counting our lucky stars that we've been lucky enough to have it take off like that. At the same time I think the novelty of seeing people like Katie Couric and Newt Gingrich sing has really captured peoples' attention. How do you make the videos? What actually goes into it? Michael likes to joke that there's a huge Auto-Tune lever that he hooks up to his computer and whenever he sees video footage he just pulls the lever, and anything that strikes his fancy is automatically Auto-Tuned. But there's a lot of technical stuff that goes into it. ... We scour a lot of footage to see what's going to work and what's not going to work. We try to find what people are going to tune well and what people won't tune well. ... Really, by the time the video gets made I'd say it's eight or 10 days of work that goes into one of these videos, between the four of us. What makes someone a good candidate for Auto-Tuning? An example of a great candidate for Auto-Tuning would be either Katie Couric or Joe Biden. Both Katie Couric and Joe Biden have just continued to astonish us with their unbelievable, almost hidden melodies in their speaking voices. A lot of it has to do with how they project their voice in terms of their soft palate. But it also has to do with how much of an oratorical fashion they speak. Joe Biden, in a lot of his speeches, is delivering them in a preacher sort of fashion that tunes really well. While someone who ended up tuning really poorly -- we thought he would tune really well! -- was Sean Hannity. We thought he'd tune really well just because Sean Hannity is always talking really loud. But it turns out that despite the fact that he was talking really loud, it was a nasal talking and it was a harsh and abrasive loud voice, so it ended up not tuning well at all. Does President Obama make for a good Auto-Tune? You know, what was great from Obama was the campaign speeches. His campaign speeches were excellent, because he was sort of using that almost gospel-preacher rhetorical style. Since he's been president, he's been so relaxed and sort of so laid back and cerebral and sort of intellectual. He's not been quite as excellent for Auto-Tuning because there's a lot more of a mumbly tone about him. A lot less of the ""Yes we can!"" and a lot more of the ""Weeeeell, as we see ..."" Has ""Auto-Tune the News"" helped your other musical efforts or do you think it's pulling you away? It's certainly making us focus a lot more on ""Auto-Tune the News."" As the videos have sort of grown in scope and become more popular, we can't help but continue to work on them as our fans clamor for more. Do you ever use Auto-Tune in the other performances, like in your band? We've never used it live. We're no Ashlee Simpson. But I think we've used it a little bit on our record. Right now it's a huge fad to Auto-Tune the crap out of people so that they sound like robots. But on pretty much any record you listen to these days there's some level of Auto-Tune on it, even if it's a very, very small amount. If there's just one small note that's just a little bit flat, why wouldn't you Auto-Tune it to make it sound OK? Do you think it's hurting music at all that people expect a singer's pitch to be perfect? It means that people who can't sing as well are becoming famous singers. But I don't know, that's why I love going to see live music, because that really sorts out the real singers from the not-so-real singers. If you could invent any technology or pick a technology that you would like to see invented, what would it be? Oh, wow. I'd probably go for a teleportation machine myself. ... Like the one they used in ""Star Trek,"" hopefully, right? Where you can jump in the teleportation machine and get to your gigs without having to carry all your amps and drive eight hours in your van. I mean, I play music for free. It's carrying my amps and driving places in my van that I have to charge people for. That'd be the real revolution for the music industry. Do you have the T-Pain iPhone app? Yeah, we were beta testers for that app. Do you use the app in day-to-day life? We've been joking around and showing it to friends who didn't have it yet. But we're playing our first concert in a while tonight [September 11]. I'm in North Carolina. And we're going to try to hook our iPhones up to the sound system and we're going to try to T-Pain our voices live. So we'll see if it works. Do you have a favorite iPhone app just in general? I'm not much of an app guy, but when I really need to kill some time I go for PapiJump. It's like the simplest, dumbest game possible on the iPhone. Other than that, the New York Times app is nice. What have you learned about the Internet in watching your videos go viral? I think a lot of people are using the Internet for just a sort of quick laugh fix. Whether you're bored at work or looking for something fun to do at home, people sort of live serious enough lives. I think everyone loves to laugh. And if you can get five minutes of the day at work ... to get a couple yucks in, I think you'd rather do that than watch your latest YouTube conspiracy movie or something.",0.59761345,6212
81,"(CNN) -- She's been called ""America's mom."" Strangers stop her for hugs in the airport. And she still dishes up kindly parental wisdom daily in reruns of ""The Brady Bunch."" ""Brady Bunch"" actress Florence Henderson founded a service to help older adults learn about computers. Now, actress Florence Henderson, otherwise known as Mrs. Brady, has a new mission: Helping older adults learn to use technology. Her new business, Floh Club, is a ""telephone-based technical support service"" focusing on people who didn't grow up with computers -- especially grandparents who want to stay in touch with family but are intimidated by webcams, Facebook, instant messaging or even e-mail. Henderson says Floh Club is ""like roadside assistance for your computer."" She spoke with CNN's Josh Levs about her inspiration, her grandkids and ""Brady Bunch"" rumors as the show celebrates its 40th anniversary.  See more of our chat with Florence Henderson » . CNN: What made you think of this? Florence Henderson: I was terrified of computers, Josh. I didn't grow up with them. And I have four kids, and they were always saying, ""Oh, Mom, please get connected."" And I would go, ""No, I don't have time."" But I was really scared. And so, a few months ago I decided that if I felt that way, there must be a lot of older adults that feel the same way, or maybe even some younger ones. I am now sending e-mails, I'm videoconferencing. I'm taking photos off my camera and actually putting them on the computer. Facebook, it is so exciting. I mean, I'm thrilled. CNN: What kinds of calls are you getting? What have people been calling and saying they need help with? Henderson: Things like as simple as learning how to send an e-mail. We have all North American-based technical experts standing by. Eighteen hours a day. Seven days a week. They are all very patient and very caring, and they will access your computer remotely, and they will talk you through any problem you may be having. They'll teach you how to use your computer. CNN: The plans and services range from $25 to up to $250 for an entire year. You have grandkids. Do you stay in touch with them this way? Henderson: You know what, Josh? That's one of the most exciting things for me is to be able to videoconference because I have a son and his wife and two children that live in St. Louis. I have a daughter in Florida. And they have two children. And now I can actually see them. I have a new granddaughter who is just a year old. I can watch her grow, and I can talk to them. To me, that is the most exciting thing. And so I'm encouraging older adults to really stay connected and use your brain. CNN: It's the 40th anniversary of the Brady Bunch. We see sitcom stars come and go. But you, 35 years after the show technically ended, you have stayed out there as an icon. What's your secret? What did you do that no one else figured out? Henderson: You know what, Josh? I think it's because I love what I do. I'm passionate about what I do. I've always kind of felt that my career was my vocation, and I love staying on top of things. Now I'm cybermom! I genuinely love to communicate. And I love people. CNN: I got to tell you, when I said I was going to talk to you today, every person I talked to said I have to get the truth about you and Greg (Barry Williams). You write about this on your blog. Just give everyone the real story. Henderson: The real story is that he always had a crush on me and he asked me to go on a date with him. And so I went. And he only had a driver's permit. And his brother had to bring him to my hotel, and then he could drive my car, you know, he had a permit. But it was so sweet and so innocent. And he's still a very dear friend.",0.59565866,8367
82,"COPENHAGEN, Denamrk (CNN) -- Actress Connie Nielsen hit the big time when she starred in ""Gladiator"" as Lucilla, sister of the deranged Emperor Commodus. Since then she has appeared in hit movies including ""One Hour Photo"" and ""The Hunted"". Connie Nielsen has always refused to play the Hollywood fame game. But Nielsen has refused to play the Hollywood fame game and seems drawn to challenging roles in controversial movies, including ""The Situation"", about the current Iraq war, and ""Battle in Seattle"", about the anti-globalization riots that took place in Seattle in 1999. Nielsen now lives in the US and returns to Copenhagen every year. She talks to My City, My Life about what makes the city, and its people, so special. CNN: How do you define yourself? Connie Nielsen: I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business. I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth. That's what I want from my art, that's what I aspire to. I try to combine my work with my family, that's what I aspire to. I don't say that's the only thing. It's not all work and family, because otherwise you would be saying no to the many other things in life and there are many other things. CNN: The people here are supposed to be incredibly happy -- what do you think? Connie Nielsen: I think it's funny in a way because when I grew up here it was very unusual to hear the word ""happiness"". If you asked somebody, ""what do you wish for in life?"" they wouldn't say ""happiness."" I would have answered ""excitement, knowledge,"" God knows -- I mean, many, many different things, but certainly not ""happiness"". It seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular. And I think that a lot of Danes kind of feel like that about being the happiest people in the world. CNN: Is there anything you'd like to change about the city? Connie Nielsen: Anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes, concentrate poor people there. It's specific to any big city. There was an effort to create buildings that concentrate these people very closely, and their social problems. They are still around in New York, Paris, London and here too. So if I could change anything about Copenhagen, or any other major big city, I would change the way we build buildings or housing for lower income people. I don't think people who are already burdened with social, economic, psychological situations, dysfunctional families, need to be burdened with other people with the same problems. CNN: Is the city politically driven? Connie Nielsen: I don't think I can remember a moment in my life where people didn't discuss politics. People discuss politics at the table. I think some of the first information I received was politically charged (laughs). It was at a time when girls were being told, ""Why don't you go and learn how to repair machines rather than learn to repair your jumper? Why don't you learn to cut wood rather than learn to keep a house clean?"" in school. It was to make us conscious of what we were, how we defined ourselves and why you would accept one concept of yourself rather than another. Have you searched through the truth of that concept? Have you deconstructed? Have you made sure that its foundations are valid? That's how I grew up and I think it was wonderful. CNN: How would you describe the city architecturally? Connie Nielsen: It's everything here from very late renaissance to this 19th century golden age we had here. It's that, intermixed with pure Danish modernism. I love the juxtaposition of it all. I love when we bring in metaphors for our past as well. CNN: A lot of the places you have taken us to have been very romantic, do you think there is a fairy tale quality to Copenhagen? Connie Nielsen: An alternative society ... yes I do, I do feel that. I do feel that most things are possible here. I can dream here. I can imagine. CNN: What is it about the city that makes people creative? Connie Nielsen: Well, we have a very, very long winter and it gets a little boring, so you better think of something to do! It can get deathly boring, so you start using your imagination. Sometimes it's necessity that produces it, because you need to do something. CNN: Is there something about the people here that want to change things for the better? Connie Nielsen: I think so -- I think we're an idealistic people. I think there are disillusioned people everywhere, there are doubters everywhere, but I do think there are constructive people here; I do think that people believe in people. CNN: Do you take any inspiration from the city? Connie Nielsen: Yes, yes I do. Whenever I come back here I remember that I want to write poetry (laughs). I want to take more time to sit and paint some more. I want to do so many more things whenever I come back -- I'm always reminded of that when I come here. CNN: You've lived in lots of cities all over the world and still do. Why is Copenhagen special to you? Connie Nielsen: I was born here and it's the capital of my home country. It's also immensely beautiful. Many of my friends live here and much of my partner's family lives here too and so we bring our kids back here every year. It holds all the museums that hold our history, our culture, and I take our children there and I go there for my own pleasure all the time. I love going to museums. I love this city and I love cities that are on the water. I love the water element, specifically the sea. I grew up on the sea and I grew up sailing -- I love sailing -- and the presence of the sea gives the air and the light a very special quality that I absolutely adore. CNN: It seems that for a small place it has a lot of cultural influence. Connie Nielsen: Yes, it's sort of a little pearl in the middle of the seas. There's a lot of traffic through this place, from the east, west, north and south. And we are the southern part of the north, so everything from the south comes up here on its way towards the north, and the opposite. And it has left its mark. We are definitely some kind of place where culture is being deposited over and over and over again, but it also springs from here. It's the kind of place that attracts creative people and so it springs from here too. CNN: If Copenhagen was a person, how would you describe it? Connie Nielsen: If Copenhagen were a person, that person would be generous, beautiful, elderly, but with a flair. A human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling, filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the old -- somebody who takes good care of things and of people.",0.5956552,4574
83,"(CNN) -- Legendary singer/songwriter Aretha Franklin sang ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"" at the inauguration Tuesday. Aretha Franklin says cold weather affected her voice during her performance at the inauguration on Tuesday. CNN's Larry King talks with ""The Queen of Soul"" about the reality of the nation's first black president, singing at the inauguration and the much-talked-about hat she wore. Larry King: Where'd you get that hat? Aretha Franklin: Well, I bought it at a little millinery that I frequent out in Detroit. King: What was that like for you (Tuesday)? Franklin: Oh. What a tremendous, mammoth morning, evening, the ball, everything, from one event to the other, was just too much. King: How did you find out you were singing? Franklin: My agent called me and he told me that he had received an invitation and a telephone call, asking for my presence and performance at the swearing-in and the inauguration. King: Did you choose the song? Franklin: Yes, I did. King: Is that a tough song to sing? Franklin: No, not at all, but (Tuesday) it was. Mainly because of the temperature outside. I don't have to tell you, it was freezing, if you were there. Some singers it doesn't bother, and others it does. I don't care for it. It affected my voice.  Watch Franklin sing at inauguration » . King: You sang at Martin Luther King's funeral. What do you remember about that? Franklin: There were very, very long lines, of course. I recall walking in the street behind the bier, somewhere maybe about 200, 300 feet from the bier, I think. I recall Leontyne Price being there, as well as Eartha Kitt. They shuttled us from one point to the other. The passing of a great man was at hand. King: How did you feel yesterday about seeing a young black man elected president? Franklin: Oh boy, how do you put it into words? There's a love affair going on with the country and Barack. I think it's the age of Barack. People have just fallen head over heels in love with him. His ascent to the presidency was miraculous. But we have to remember that he's not going to work miracles right off the top. It's going to take time.  Watch Franklin discuss joy of seeing nation's first black president » . (There's) a lot of problems, and there's a plethora of things to deal with for he and his administration. King: One thing, with your magnificent voice, is it hard to sing outdoors? Franklin: It depends on the temperature. Yesterday, Mother Nature was not very kind to me. I'm going to deal with her when I get home. It, by no means, was my standard. I was not happy with it, but I just feel blessed because it could have been five above zero or five below zero like it is in Detroit. I was still blessed to be able to pretty much just sing the melody, but I wasn't happy with it, of course. King: It was great to listen to. Franklin: I was delighted and thrilled to be there. That was the most important thing, not so much the performance, but just to be there and to see this great man go into office -- the promise of tomorrow coming to pass.",0.59395814,1752
85,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Hugh Masekela is the legendary South African musician whose songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid. He tells CNN about growing up under apartheid, why he left South Africa and what is was like to move back to Johannesburg after 30 years away. Hugh Masekela: ""The people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom."" CNN: How did the suffering of the apartheid influence your art? Hugh Masekela: I don't think what I do is influenced by suffering. I come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance. We have wonderful singers and we have a diversity of music here that is just amazing. But in spite of being oppressed these people were very resilient and they were mostly resilient through song. I think we are the only society where music played such a major part in our resistance. We grew up in rallies and in the street. We didn't have televisions so we played in the streets and made up songs about what was happening. Watch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg ». CNN: What's your earliest memory of Johannesburg? HM: I came to Jo' burg from Springs [a town near Johannesburg]. My family moved to Alexandra township and the first time I went to town alone I must have been 10 or 11. Jo' burg used to be scrubbed every night with fire hoses and those hard brooms and the granite on the sidewalks would always sparkle. I remember that because I came from Alexander township where there were no lights, no sewage and no cafes. The most vivid memory I have -- we used to stop and look through restaurant windows at the white people eating fancy food, and we'd say ""what do you think that is?"" and ""there are so many types of food!"" CNN: How did it feel to leave South Africa? HM: When I left South Africa in 1960 I was 20 years old. I wanted to try to get an education and music education was not available for me in South Africa. I wanted to learn from the same kind of teachers that taught Miles Davis and Clifford Brown and Chad Baker and they were not in South Africa. I hoped that one day I could go and learn some of those things and then come back and teach. It was a rough time, when the apartheid government first started showing that if you don't behave, they'll shoot you -- women and children too. You saw police with guns, with machine guns, and for the first time you saw tanks. We had a group called the Jazz Epistles and we were about to take off on a national tour. We were the first African group to play on an LP, but gatherings of more than 10 people were banned so we couldn't do our tour. But four years later, when I was ready to come back to South Africa, I couldn't. The place was impenetrable. By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to. See Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg » . CNN: Tell us about coming home. HM: It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa and we were not naive about it. It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening. When I left South Africa there were 10 million people -- when I came back there were more than 40 million. I had to learn how to get to the highways because when I left where there were no highways. And I had to adjust my language because people would say ""we don't' talk like that anymore!"" I was like a sponge trying to learn to do the right things. Not many people came back from exile compared with those who left. About a million left -- 50,000 came back, and of those about 25,000 did a U-turn because it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy but it's been a great experience. CNN: How would you define the culture of Jo' burg? HM: There's no one culture -- it's a cosmopolitan city. It's so diverse, like South Africa itself has so many diverse cultures. But again, we are still living in the culture of ethnic grouping. If we could beat that and have a major festival of tolerance, it would be the shining path. CNN: Where do you like to go out in Jo' burg? HM: I go to Newtown, I go to the Market Theater a lot, and also to the Dance Forum, because we have very brilliant dance choreographers. Old Jo' burg was vibrant, there were things going on all the time -- concerts, festivals, clubs -- but in the last 10 years or so it has become a very quiet city at night. CNN: What is life like in the city? HM: It's not very easy to enjoy the city because the safety and security is not such that you can just go anywhere any time. There's a sadness about this city that everybody talks about. People in South Africa have become inward; they spend most of the time in their homes. When it gets dark, everyone wants to go home as quickly as they can. That is not only Jo' burg's problem, it is a national problem. What we're talking about doesn't make me very popular with the people who run this country, but it's nothing new -- you see it in the newspapers every day. It has to be fixed, because the people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom to enjoy the beauty of their country and to show guests around and say ""this is my country.""",0.59139323,4844

Shatner: We laughed our way through five years of great joy, great entertainment, and we got some wonderful awards during the years and the beauty of it all was that when we came in this season, we knew we were going to do 13 shows and be out. So the writing reflected the fact that we knew we were ending and it wrapped the whole show up. CNN: I cannot believe you have a porn queen [Jenna Jameson] on your talk show.

88,"(CNN) -- It has been 20 years since best-selling crime writer Patricia Cornwell began work on her first novel in the series chronicling the cases of forensic analyst Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Now, both have found celebrity. Cornwell's latest novel, ""The Scarpetta Factor,"" places her enduring heroine in a role the author knows all too well, a pop culture celebrity sought-after for her expertise. In an interview with CNN.com, Cornwell discussed the challenges of staying fresh, the need for happy endings and the merits of the History Channel and the movie ""White Chicks."" CNN: The title of your new book, ""The Scarpetta Factor,"" has many meanings. Can you tell me about some of them? Cornwell: On the one hand, it's a very direct reference to the fact she's the chief forensic analyst for CNN in this book. But while she's doing the on-air spots, they decide they want her to have her own show and that's what they call it, ""The Scarpetta Factor,"" which is a reference to a cliché that's beginning to float around, that there's one element that she can add that will solve the case like she's Sherlock Holmes. This becomes very upsetting to her, first of all, because it's a cliché and the scientist in her doesn't think she has a special factor, she's a scientist. It begins to pose problems for her because even some colleagues and friends start to wonder if she's begun to believe her own legend and make mistakes. With her years of experience and high level of visibility and exceptional grasp of the criminal world, she would be asked to be on major shows. When someone like Michael Jackson dies or Caylee Anthony disappears, that's the obvious thing that would happen. People would say, I wonder what Scarpetta has to say. I'm trying to put her in the world we live in. CNN: Why did you choose CNN? Cornwell: It would make perfect sense that she would sit on the set with Anderson Cooper or Wolf Blizter and be asked relevant questions from a hard news angle. It's one [network] she would go on and there's lots she wouldn't go on. CNN: How have things changed since you published your first novel? Cornwell: When I was shopping my first book around, it was rejected by the major publishing houses and that was because a lot of people didn't think morgues and labs were interesting, and that's a huge statement about how things have changed. I remember one time, I called my literary agent at that time, and I said I was in a toxicology lab, and she said, I hate talking to you because you're always in these awful places. Forensic science was not viewed as cool, as it is today. CNN: Are there any on-air personalities we might recognize in ""The Scarpetta Factor?"" Cornwell: When she is up at CNN for a scene when she's on a fictitious show, she walks past posters of Nancy Grace and Lou Dobbs and Wolf Blitzer because she's up on that floor, so I do make real references to people, but the characters, the producers, none are real and they're not based on anybody I met or know. CNN: How much of yourself do you see in Kay Scarpetta? Over the years, have you grown into her or has she grown into you? Cornwell: Only insofar as we have the same values and sensibilities and perhaps the same approach to solving cases. I'm imposing the way my mind works in terms of connecting the dots, but beyond that, there are huge differences between us. She's a standalone character. I would feel very self-conscious and bored if she was a projection of me. I have certain things in common with all my characters. Like Marino, I can be a slob and sometimes say stupid things and rush to judgment. CNN: You're known for doing a lot of research on the ground to give your stories depth and realism. Where did your research for ""The Scarpetta Factor"" take you? Cornwell: I've certainly been in the CNN studios so that's helpful. When I was there over in the last year, I made a mental note of everything I saw while walking around so I could create the studio in the novel. I also spent lot of time with the NYPD, their bomb squad, their emergency unit, the Real Time Crime Center, so I could describe the amazing way computers are used to transmit data to police responding to a call. I spent time at the NYPD crime lab, the New York Medical Examiner's office, so I can show Scarpetta actually working there. The scene in the elevator in the beginning and the way people ID loved ones is based on what happens. Even the technology of the electronic nose, the mechanical sniffer that takes the place of cadaver dogs, is based on things I've seen. My research also included looking into the methods and means criminals are using, like TracFones, spoofcards and the different ways to disguise IP addresses. CNN: How has the CSI factor affected your research for your books? Cornwell: I think people are so inundated with this sort of detail that I don't want to make the story just about forensics. The people and their relationships are the heart of my books, the forensics are something they wear like an old pair of shoes. I'll always show you the latest and greatest forensic science and technology, but I can't show it all, so it's very important that I make things interesting in different ways. In the early to mid-'90s, up to the late '90s when I was coming out with new books, I was the only show in town and all of the sudden now they're everywhere, and I don't have any problem with that because I don't own forensics or forensic pathology. CNN: In your opinion, what has been the greatest change in forensic science since Scarpetta started out? Cornwell: DNA has changed our lives forever, just like the Internet has changed our lives, there's no going back to pre-DNA or pre-Internet. I would say both of those. The Internet has dramatically changed everything because it's creating a whole new wave of crimes that our laws and the courts don't know how to deal with. DNA analysis and the ultra-sensitivity of it: When you're dealing with some types of DNA, you only need three or four human cells to get a DNA profile, which is something that can't even see with the naked eye, so that helps investigators but it also creates a whole other set of problems. They're saying there will be a point when you can get DNA just from someone walking in the room, and you can see the problems if you have 20 people walk into a room and only one did something bad. Defense lawyers are going to have a field day with that. CNN: What do you want people to take away from this novel? I'd like them to take away an idea of how someone like Scarpetta deals with being in the same world you and I wake up to. Now she has a BlackBerry and she has to deal with it, which poses as many problems as it offers benefits. I want people to feel happy ending the book. We need to feel good right now, there's a lot to feel bad about and that's something I decided with the last book, I didn't want people to be depressed when they finished it. I used to write very dark books but we lived in happier times. Now, the goal is to scare you, lead you into suspense but when you finish, I want you to feel happy. CNN: What current cases in the news fascinate you? How much attention do you pay to crime and justice news? Cornwell: I'm fascinated by the Michael Jackson situation and the people who disappear and get abducted, all of it fascinates me in terms of the psychology involved and what science might tell us. I'm always frustrated because I love to know what's behind the scenes. I've been following Michael Jackson because it seems so unnecessary, an example of people who should've said no and not taken it upon themselves to solve a problem. I've also been interested in the case in Italy with the American on trial for murder. That is intriguing from a forensic standpoint because I think all of us would like to know more about the evidence and what's there to piece together that could tell us what happened. I'm afraid that because of how much time has passed and how the case was handled that a lot of the answers are gone and the kind of evidence that was collected could have been handled differently, . CNN: What do you like to watch? Cornwell: I don't watch crime dramas. I don't want to subconsciously get ideas from their shows. I try to keep my mind blank, and keep the influence of my own research, so I don't tend to watch crime dramas or crime movies. I rarely read crime novels because my work is so steeped in nonfiction, so I try to keep my mind free of those ideas. What I watch is the nonfiction, documentary type things, shows that depict real crimes that happened. I like the History Channel and I will watch reruns of ""The Sopranos"" until I'm 90 years old. I like comedy, stuff that's mindless. I don't watch stuff that scares me or makes me sad. There's enough of that in real life. CNN: What's the last movie you saw? Cornwell: The last movie I saw was a rerun of ""White Chicks."" How's that to people who think I have this very esoteric repertoire? I think it's a hilarious movie. ... Will Ferrell, I love his stuff, Ben Stiller, I really enjoy comedy, especially stuff that's kind of warmhearted in its own way. I don't like stuff that's really scary. I've seen so much stuff that's real. Blood is always real to me. If they ever make a real movie of Scarpetta, I may not be able to watch it.",0.5767823,6828

CNN: Tell me about when you first arrived in New York. CB: I first arrived in New York in 1979. I was 19 and I was going to University in Houston, Texas, and I decided that I knew what I wanted to do and it was time to go and do it. I literally ran away from college. Then I went to an acting school, ""HB Studio"" and I moved into this apartment with three other girls who wanted to be actresses. Of course, they were all waitresses so I was a waitress. Watch Candace Bushnell take CNN on a tour of New York. » . I was incredibly determined -- I wrote short stories, I wrote the beginnings of novels. I wrote a little children's book and sent it to the editor-in-chief of the children's division of Simon and Schuster and she asked me to write a little children's book for a series she was doing. I got paid $1,000 for it and I was like ""Oh my god, who says you can't make it in New York right away!"" Of course that little dream crashed in about a month. CNN: So you didn't have an overnight success? CB: I was a freelancer all through my twenties. I did about one story a month and I wanted to write fiction, so the stories that I would do were precursors to ""Sex and the City."" I started working for the NY Observer when I was 33. After I had been writing for them for about a year and a half the editor said, ""Your stories are the most talked about stories in the Observer, you should have your own column."" I was paid $1000 a column and the reason was that the column ""Sex and the City."" was so popular that they sold newspapers and advertising off it. See photos of Candace Bushnell's New York. » . People in New York were faxing it to their friends who worked in the movie business in LA and almost immediately I was getting phone calls from movie producers who wanted to buy it and ABC and HBC wanted to buy it. It started as a seed, with an absolute truth that people may agree with or it may disturb them. It disturbs me sometimes when I read it because it's very wrong and very honest. I think most call it cynicism but I call it realism -- it is absolutely raw reality. It was never written for a big audience and it was never written to make people feel good. It was written as the truth in a humorous way. CNN: How do you feel about the TV series? CB: I think the reason why the TV series has continued, and has continued as a movie, is that they have never lost the authenticity of the column. CNN: How would you describe New York today? CB: It's a very, very busy place and it's a city where everybody has a place to go and a million things to do. It certainly can be a very stressful city but it can also be an incredibly exciting city. It is a place where your dreams can come true. It's also a city where you're going to see sides of human nature that you're going to be shocked by. New York is a city where, if you are open minded, when you walk out of your apartment you don't know what could happen. CNN: What do you do to get away from it? CB: I go to Connecticut and I look at bugs and I don't socialize. If I'm here for 10 days in a row I'm exhausted. When I was younger the energy really fed me. This is a city of energy vampires -- people really feed on each others' energies and that's why New Yorkers talk fast and gesture and they'll come in and say ""Oh my god you won't believe what happened!"" That's a normal greeting in New York. CNN: What was it like to get married and stop being the single girl? CB: Charles [Askegard, a principal dancer with the NYC ballet] and I met at the NYC Spring Gala seven years ago. It was really a magical moment because I was 43 and I had kind of given up on that. I was cynical about relationships and I wasn't sure about marriage -- I was always very worried that marriage was stifling. But when I saw Charles across the room I thought, ""That's the man you're going to marry."" We met and we talked and I thought, ""This is the nicest guy I have ever met in my life,"" and we went to a club and we danced and we kissed. We got married two months after we met.

91,"(CNN) -- Since the early days of pop music, the music industry has been searching for the secret formula to writing a successful song -- for that special alchemy that separates a Grammy-winner from a dud. For a period in the 1970s and 80s, the self-styled King of Pop Michael Jackson seemed to have stumbled upon it, but somewhere along the line he, too, seems to have misplaced it. Hit Song Science claims to be able to predict whether a song will be a pop hit . But now a piece of software claims it can compute whether a song has chart-topping potential, and a number of record companies and musicians are using Hit Song Science (HSS) to gauge whether they have a hit on their hands. The software, developed by Barcelona-based Music Intelligence Solutions, works by breaking down more than 60 elements of a song, including melody, harmony, tempo, pitch, octave, beat, rhythm, fullness of sound, noise, brilliance and chord progression, and compares it against a database of over 3.5 million past commercial hits. The program organizes songs into clusters with similar-sounding equivalents and then rates the song on a scale of one to ten, with a score of 7.3 being deemed likely to do well in the music charts. Curiously, clusters of songs do not necessarily contain songs that sound the same to the human ear, but from a mathematical perspective they share similarities. HSS analyzed music from Norah Jones' first album before she broke through and the program's algorithms placed her in a cluster with Linkin Park, Aerosmith and JayZ. If you have ever wondered why you sometimes find yourself humming along to some smooth jazz on the radio when you consider yourself a strict thrash metal fan only, then perhaps HSS has discovered the scientific answer. Besides Norah Jones, the program also predicted success for Mika, while ""Turn Your Car Around,"" a song penned by Ben Novak, a singer-songwriter from New Zealand, was rated as a potential hit by HSS, who recommended it to Sony Music in the UK. It eventually ended up as a vehicle for ex-Blue band member Lee Ryan and scored a respectable UK chart position of 16 in 2005. Record producer Carlos Quintero, director of Orixe and Jamm Records in Spain, believes that the software has a high accuracy rate. ""I was very skeptical when I was told about it for the first time,"" he says. ""I thought it was science fiction. ""But when we choose a tune for an artist and we like it and feel it will be a hit, the surprise is that 85 percent of the time the tracks we have chosen get a positive analysis from the software."" The emergence of hit prediction programs such as this -- New York-based Platinum Blue Music Intelligence provides a similar service -- raises concerns that the creative element of writing music would be eroded by breaking it down into mathematical algorithms. But Quintero claims the program in no way writes a song, it simply tells you whether it has the potential to be a hit. He says he mainly uses the software to tweak and refine songs so that he can maximize his chances of scoring a high chart position. ""There was a particular case where we had to revise the song as at first it wasn't completely right. Using the software, we managed to make it work,"" he explains. ""The problem with the software is that it can only indicate whether a song is suitable or not. It's up to the producer, the technical team and the artist to make it suitable in the first place."" Quintero has since become a member of Music Intelligence Solutions' advisory board, so he is bound to have a positive take on the service. Jimena Llosa, General Manager EMEA of Music Intelligence Solutions, claims the company has thirty to forty clients in the record industry in Europe and the U.S., but she says she cannot reveal who they are, citing privacy issues. CNN attempted to contact several record companies in London, but A&R departments claimed they had not heard of the service, suggesting either a certain coyness to admit using it or that it is not as widely used as Music Intelligence claims. The software can also be used as a way of recommending new music to audiences. In Spain, cellular phone company Orange is using the technology in its New Talents enterprise. Listeners can enter in their favorite songs and the program will suggest songs they might enjoy according to its cluster system. Óscar Sainz is one musician who has profited from this new way of connecting musicians with an audience. A national tennis monitor by profession, he struggled to make an impact in the music industry despite the best efforts of Pablo Pinilla, one of Spain's most successful music producers. But since the Orange initiative his career has taken off and he is now selling well through Orange and touring the country. ""A machine or at least mathematical or scientific formulas that could analyze the parameters that a song needs to be a hit? The truth is I doubted it at first,"" he says. ""My first instinct was it must be a con. ""Don't ask me what parameters they use, or formulas, or machines they use, because I don't know. But it works."" But the software has its skeptics. Jim Elliot, writer and producer of Kylie Minogue's new single ""2 Hearts"" is unconvinced about the accuracy of the program. He entered tracks from her new Album ""X"" and they were, unsurprisingly, rated as potential hits. But he also entered a little-known, unreleased, song by 70s band Gong that included cows mooing, and it was also rated as a potential chart-topper. He thinks that the program negates the unpredictability of human behavior. ""The fact is that it's the human errors introduced in the music-making process that are always the most interesting,"" he says. ""Who would have thought Lily Allen would do so well? I doubt anyone would have predicted that. ""It's so hard to categorize music. There's a real danger of doing that. If you are writing and producing music you can try to fit it to certain formulas but it's so abstract that it has to be free -- and then something good will happen."" With just one fifth of their musicians making a profit for today's record companies, executives are always searching for new ways to narrow the risk margin. Hit Song Science may become a useful string in their bow in the elusive art of predicting a hit. Otherwise they will have to keep relying on tried and tested -- and more human -- methods, such as gut instinct. E-mail to a friend .",0.572467,4695
92,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Lucas didn't get to be a billionaire by delegating. George Lucas says he was ""completely surprised"" by ""Star Wars in Concert.""

But while he's enthusiastic about the new touring show ""Star Wars In Concert,"" it wasn't his idea, and when I talked with him before the first Los Angeles performance this week, he kept giving the credit to others.

CNN: Obviously, when John Williams did the music for the original film, neither of you could have guessed your association would last so long, or that you'd be so identified with each other. How did he get involved originally?

And Steve won't let him go either! CNN: How did this show come together? Lucas: Howard! [Lucas calls over Howard Roffman, the president of Lucas Licensing.] You're the man who did the whole thing -- I've got nothing to do with it. ... We would kid him about how his concert was going and he had to get Johnny [Williams] to buy in and me to buy in. Howard Roffman: Well, he always got it from the beginning, so he was an easy sell. CNN: But what was it he ""got""? How did you sell him on a new concept for his franchise? Roffman: I think he understood that the music was so powerful and the images are so powerful that when you put that together with a live orchestra on a big venue, I mean, who would not be thrilled to see that? CNN: It's a very different experience, being live. Lucas: It's very powerful. I was completely surprised by it. And I've seen other live orchestra performances with ""Star Wars"" images, but nothing like this -- I mean this really works, because it was edited specifically to bring out the emotion.",0.57243013,6720
93,"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Since he opened his first restaurant in the heart of Beverly Hills in the early eighties, Wolfgang Puck has gone on to become a household name in the U.S. Puck says L.A. has perfect weather, ""fabulous light and very little rain"" His chain of airport restaurants stretch across the states while his brand adorns everything from pizzas to non-stick pans. He lives in Los Angeles with his second wife and their two young children. CNN: What first drew you to L.A.? Wolfgang Puck: I came to the U.S. when I was 24. I spent a month in New York and a year in Indianapolis but I always dreamt about the beaches in California. I had a blue 1967 Cadillac. In 1974 I packed my suitcases, put them in a trailer and drove straight to L.A. It took me five days to drive from Indianapolis.  Watch Wolfgang Puck take CNN on a tour of L.A. » . CNN: What has kept you here all these years? Wolfgang Puck: In L.A. you live in a big city, but you feel like you're in the countryside. For example, I can be at home in the swimming pool and be five minutes from everything. It has the perfect weather -- the movie industry started here because of the fabulous light and very little rain. See pictures of Wolfgang Puck's Los Angeles . CNN: Does everyone in L.A. want to be an actor? Wolfgang Puck: It's a city of dreams. It's nice to dream but a lot of people forget it's very difficult. They think you become Cate Blanchett or Jack Nicholson just like that, but these people paid their dues. They forget how much time it took them to get there and how good they really are. CNN: You are the official caterer to the Oscars. It must an exciting event to be part of. Wolfgang Puck: When we cater the Governor's Ball, we have 300 people in the kitchen and 600 in the dining room. It goes very fast and it's done the right way. I remember Michael Caine came to Spago (Puck's flagship Beverly Hills eaterie) the Monday after the awards with his family and said could he get the same dish that he ate at the awards, which means we really nailed it. CNN: How has the city inspired your cooking? Wolfgang Puck: For me, cooking is an expression of the land where you are and the culture of that place. L.A. is a melting pot of many different cultures and we have fabulous ingredients here. If you go to San Diego, San Francisco you can get the best vegetables, the best fruits, sea food -- all these wonderful ingredients. CNN: How does L.A. compare with New York? Wolfgang Puck: New Yorkers think they have everything, all the best art and music. But really L.A. is a better place. Some of the most famous artists in the world work right here. CNN: You're a big fan of modern art. How did that start? Wolfgang Puck: I got interested in contemporary art because I worked in a restaurant right across the street from a gallery where they made prints for people like David Hockney. The artists came for lunch at the restaurant so I used to talk to them. Hockney made the first cover of my cook book; I had Andy Warhol do the label for our wine. I feel that painting is in some way like cooking -- if you add a little more blue, a little less blue it doesn't matter. The same thing with cooking: a little of this, a little bit more of that. As long as the end result is beautiful, that's what counts. CNN: If L.A. was personified, what would they be like? Wolfgang Puck: A person who enjoys themselves. They do a great job at work but also can have a good time. To me that's what life is all about.",0.56959426,9206

95,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- If you're a comedy fan, you've probably heard of him by now. Comedian Brian Regan, 50, is famous for his clean jokes about everyday life. He is on tour. Famous for his clean jokes about everyday life, comedian Brian Regan is at the peak of his career, gaining new followers with every performance. On a recent Saturday night, he dazzled a sold-out audience of more than 2,000 people near Atlanta as part of his 2009 comedy tour. The easygoing 50-year-old comedian with a boyish smile and energetic presence pranced back and forth across the stage Saturday telling jokes that brought laughter to issues both serious and silly -- from the stressful economy to the quirks of text messaging. Regan, a Miami, Florida, native, has been performing stand-up comedy since 1980 by starting at small venues and comedy clubs. His breakthrough came in the late 1990s after the release of his album ""Brian Regan Live,"" which sold 150,000 copies despite the comedian's relative obscurity at the time. The album featured simple routines that made fun of childhood memories such as Little League baseball games and seat belts. His witty, clean style of humor on the album, which resonated with a wide audience from college kids to grandmothers, catapulted him to success. Since then, he has gone on to release three DVDs. Punchline Magazine, a comedy publication, named Regan's most recent DVD, ""The Epitome of Hyperbole,"" one of the top five comedy DVDs of 2008. Nowadays, he routinely appears on television, including specials on Comedy Central and slots on the ""Late Show With David Letterman."" His tour this year will visit more than 80 cities, nearly twice as many as four years ago. CNN.com sat down with Regan to learn more about his brand of comedy and what's in store for the future. CNN: How did you become interested in comedy and stand-up? Brian Regan: This isn't the main reason, but when I was in college [Heidelberg College in Ohio], my name was Rip for Rip van Winkle. I had a 7 a.m. class, and I missed it almost every day. I would wake up and run across campus. I remember thinking, ""What's going to happen if I don't wake up for things?"" And then a comedian performed at our college, and I went to the show, and I noticed the show started at 8 p.m. and I was like, well, the hours are good. I can handle a job that starts at 8 p.m. CNN: Who are some of your influences? Regan: I love Steve Martin. He took silliness to a level of brilliance, I think. CNN: How do you get your ideas? Regan: I used to try and sit down with a blank piece of paper. I would stare at the paper, and it just continues to stay blank. I've learned that for me, it's easier for me to go out and live my life and do my thing. CNN: You don't really use the crass language many comedians rely on. Is there a reason for that? Regan: I don't really know those words [laughing]. I used to have a few jokes here and there with a four-letter word in it. I was always 90 to 95 percent clean with my jokes anyways, and I'm kind of anal so, why be 95 percent something when you could be 100 percent something? It worked out, and people really seem to respond to it so I guess that other 5 percent wasn't that important anyways. CNN: Do you try to incorporate the economy into your jokes? Regan: I do a few jokes about the economy but from an everyday person perspective. People like to laugh, and they especially like to laugh during difficult circumstances. One of the best shows in New York I had was the week after 9/11. I was surprised this comedy club was even going to have a show. They said people were looking for a diversion. I went up and said I'm not trying to make light of what happened, I'm just trying to forget about it for an hour. I find it's similar to what is happening with the economy. Obviously, it's not as serious as 9/11, but people are looking for an escape. I think people want to laugh. CNN: How can comedy help people through tough times? Regan: I think comedy is a good way to deal with anything. I hear about people in the hospital who are ill, and they use humor to help them through it. I think it's a great remedy for many things. They say a formula for comedy is comedy equals tragedy plus time. A difficult or uncomfortable situation takes place, and then you laugh about it later down the road. Sometimes I wonder if I could be so mentally healthy to subtract the time part. Like what if there is a flat tire, and it's raining outside? Instead of laughing a month later, why not laugh while you are changing tires in the rain? CNN: Your fan base has really grown in the last five years. How does the fame feel? Regan: It's been a slow gradual thing for me. I've never had a single event or television show that did it. I just pick up a couple more fans and a few more fans, and before you know it, it's like hey man, things are going OK. CNN: What's in store for the future? Regan: This is what I like doing, and I will hopefully do it forever. If something else comes along, I'd be open to that. CNN: What about a television show? Regan: I'm not really interested in being an actor. But I would like to get on a television show that would capture my comedy and in that role do a little acting. I'd like to do something that has to do with my comedy.",0.5685988,2575
96,"(CNN) -- Ted Turner appeared Tuesday on CNN, the network he founded, to talk about last week's election results, his business ventures, and his relationship with ex-wife Jane Fonda. CNN founder Ted Turner tells the network he's ""encouraged"" by the results of last week's election. Turner is promoting a new autobiography, ""Call Me Ted"" (Warner Books), which documents his life, loves, successes and failures. Probably best known for his 1980 launch of CNN, the first 24-hour all-news cable network, Turner has also made news as a philanthropist and supporter of the United Nations. He won the America's Cup of yachting in 1977, and owned the Atlanta Braves when they won the World Series in 1995. Turner discussed the book on CNN's ""American Morning."" The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Let me ask you first of all, before we get involved in the actual book and the story of your life: What do you make of the results of this presidential election? Ted Turner: Well, I'm encouraged. I think we needed change that we can believe in.  Watch Turner talk about his relationship with ex-wife Jane Fonda » . CNN: Is [President-elect Barack Obama] the guy to pull this economy? Turner: Well, I don't know. I mean, our country in my lifetime has never been in this shape before. So we'll have to see. I think we are really heading into uncharted territory. But I think the main problem is, I hope he doesn't get blamed if things get tough -- because I think they are going to. CNN: [Obama] seems to be talking about a lot more government involvement in the business community going forward, more government money for an auto industry bailout, another economic stimulus package. As a person who pulled [himself] up in the business community from his bootstraps, is that the way to do it, with more government involvement? Turner: Well, I don't think so. It was a struggle financing CNN, but I did it without ever asking the government for a nickel. In fact, I gave the government $32 million when they were a little short and couldn't pay the dues to the U.N. CNN: A lot of people in this economic community losing an awful lot of money, something you know something about. Turner: I've lost a lot, too. We all have. CNN: You lost $7 billion when the dot-com bubble burst after the Time Warner-AOL merger. How did you not see the dot-com bubble bursting? How did you not see that that was all built on air? Turner: Maybe I did, but I was on a board of directors and a founder, and I was concerned about the AOL merger, but we didn't know that the books were cooked. We didn't do enough due diligence. CNN: Was that the worst business decision of your life? Turner: Oh yeah. Absolutely. CNN: If you could go back and do it again, would you have just completely called the whole thing off? Turner: Well, I couldn't have. At the time, there was so much momentum to do the deal, everybody was for it -- all of Wall Street and the management of both companies. And I wouldn't -- we could have stopped it if we had known of the accounting irregularities. But we didn't know. So there was no way to stop it. CNN: At about the same time, you were hemorrhaging money at the rate of about $10 million a day over the course of more than two years, your marriage to Jane Fonda broke up. And many people close to you were concerned -- because your father, who passed off his billboard business to you, committed suicide -- that you may follow him down that road. Turner: I wouldn't do that to my children and grandchildren. CNN: But they were concerned about it. Turner: Well, they might have been concerned about it, but there was no reason to be. CNN: You went through counseling, though, to try to come back. What was that road like? Turner: What, counseling? I've been in all kinds of counseling. I believe in doctors. Where I really spent the time was in couples and marriage counseling. It helped some. I was married for 10 years one time and 18 another. CNN: ... Jane Fonda has said, and said in the ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired over the weekend, that she still loves you. Is there-- . Turner: She didn't say that. CNN: Well, she says that she would be at your side in a blue minute. Turner: If I needed her. CNN: I would assume that somebody wouldn't do that unless they love you. Turner: It was nice of her to do. CNN: Any chance for a reconciliation? Turner: I don't think so, but you never know. CNN: What would it take? Turner: I don't know. More than a television interview. CNN: Have you thought about picking up the phone? Turner: No. I talk to her all the time. ... CNN: She said that -- this is a quote from the interview -- she said, ""It's impossible to really be with Ted the way he needs someone to be with him and have any kind of life of your own."" Are you tough to live with? Turner: I travel a lot. I'm on the move. CNN: You don't like to be alone? Turner: No. CNN: Why are you on the move so much? Turner: I don't know. I just got in the habit of it because that's how you get a lot done. Going from here to Philadelphia, and from Philadelphia to Atlanta, and Atlanta to Chicago, and Chicago to Los Angeles. When you are promoting a book, you really move. CNN: I know you've got to move around a lot. But some people have observed that when you are chased by demons, you have to move around a lot to stay out in front of them. Turner: Well, I'm not chased by demons. I feel pretty good. CNN: Why would people say that? Turner: I don't know. That I'm chased by demons? I don't know. They don't know. The only person who knows about demons is me. CNN: It's been a while since you have been involved with CNN. When you look -- . Turner: No, I'm involved every day, because I watch it just about every day. CNN: Involved in terms of the business aspect. Turner: That's OK, but viewers have got a lot of rights, too. ... [If] you don't have viewers, you don't have a business. CNN: ... When you come here and see how it's grown up, you see the international aspect of it, you see that on Election Night, CNN -- Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, Campbell Brown, John King -- . Turner: They did a good job. CNN: They beat the networks. What do you think what you see that? Turner: I think it's great. CNN: This is the little entity that you started out of nothing. Turner: It's not so little. And it wasn't when we merged with Time Warner, either. Was the world's most important network. CNN: So what's next for you, if anything, at 70 years old? Turner: Well, I'm still promoting the book. It just came out two days ago. So that's a lot of work. CNN: ... [The book describes your] getting stuck on a sandbar, getting caught in a storm, almost dying off the coast of Cape Hatteras. ... How did you go from being a sailor that got stuck on the reef and almost died to somebody who managed to win the America's Cup on the Courageous?. Turner: Well, the same way in baseball, [the Atlanta Braves] set a record for consecutive last-place finishes in divisional play in baseball. First four years, we finished last, four years in a row. But I stuck with it and after 18 years, we won the World Series. And that's what I did with sailing. CNN: Just stick to it? Turner: Yeah. [I] stuck to it. And I wasn't losing -- I was just learning how to win.",0.56045806,4677
97,"(InStyle.com) -- The Cyrus family is ready to rock and always on a roll at its new L.A. home. Kick back and chill out with Billy Ray, Miley and the entire guitar-crazy clan. Billy Ray, Tish and Miley join Braison and Noah for chips and salsa in the kitchen before a rare barbecue. After months on the road, playing concerts one city at a time, Hannah Montana deserves a little R&R when she gets home. ""I just Superman onto my bed,"" says Miley Cyrus, 15, whose Disney Channel alter ego has made her a pop sensation, with two multiplatinum sound-track albums and more than 70 sold-out concerts in the past year. ""I love to sleep. I'd sleep all day if I could."" Her father and Hannah co-star, country music icon Billy Ray Cyrus, prefers to think of the family's Mediterranean-style villa in North Hollywood as more than a crash pad. ""I like for the house to be an escape from the insanity that is outside,"" says the 46-year-old singer and actor best known for his signature hit ""Achy Breaky Heart."" Inside, the superstars focus simply on relaxing with Miley's mom and manager, Tish, 41, grandmother Loretta Finley (who runs Miley's fan club), 72, brothers Trace, 19, and Braison, 14, and sisters Brandi, 21, and Noah, 8. ""Our house is fun,"" says Miley. ""Parts of it are really modern, but it's mostly old Italian country."" She opted for a ""more chill"" vibe in her two-room bedroom one for sleeping, one for hanging out and playing music with friends such as dancer Mandy Jiroux and High School Musical's Ashley Tisdale. Inspired by the ultra-cool Viceroy Hotel in nearby Santa Monica, the suite has sea blue walls, coral-filled lamps and a delicate shell chandelier that hangs over her bed. ""It feels beachy and Old Hollywood,"" says Miley. ""I love the way the room is laid out."" Billy Ray felt the same way about the entire house the first time he saw it in 2007, when the family decided they needed more space and privacy in the after-blast of Hannah Montana's success... ""I just walked in and said, 'That's it; that's the place,'"" he says. Though Billy Ray and Miley have work to do in their native Tennessee, where the highly anticipated Hannah Montana movie is filming, right now he's eager to lead his youngest daughter on a roller-skating expedition around the house. Miley sits at the foot of the stairs, teaching her brother how to break in his guitar strings. The Cyrus clan is happy to be home, even if the comings and goings of family and friends sometimes get as crazy as life on the road. ""It feels like we're at the YMCA; there are so many people just in our family,"" Miley says with a laugh. ""Then our friends come over, and it's like, OK, this is a stinkin' country club!""

98,"(CNN) -- Generations of standup comedians never saw this coming. John Heffron is one of an increasing number of comedians joining Twitter. To succeed in the industry these days, you don't just need to be good on stage and screen. You also have to nail the art of sending out mini-messages to Twitter ""followers."" But if your humor is based on storytelling, persona and, you know, the way you say stuff, how can you get hilarious in 140 characters or less? For the pros, it's a challenge and an opportunity. CNN's Josh Levs spoke with two successful standup comics who are diving into the Twitterverse. John Heffron is a winner of ""Last Comic Standing."" Craig Shoemaker won the award for funniest comedy routine on XM Satellite Radio.  Watch Heffron and Shoemaker mix it up » . And we want to hear from you. Send the funniest tweets you've ever seen to Levs via Twitter (@joshlevscnn) or post them on Facebook. The following is an edited version of the interview. Craig Shoemaker: I'm on the information super-cul-de-sac. I mean, I'm not so great at this; I'm learning. And I have no friends. I had more friends at my house yesterday for dinner than I have on Twitter. And (Heffron) is the king. CNN: How did you build up your fan base, John? How did you build up this number of followers on Twitter? John Heffron: I try to be funny; I try to be entertaining; I try to do stuff that hopefully gets re-twitted. Is that the word? Sure. CNN: All right, let's take a look at some of your popular tweets here. You have a section called the original last tweets. And you have one here: ""Guy who always gets killed on Star Trek. Last tweet: 'Got my uniform. The rest of the landing party wearing a different color. Weird!' "" And then my favorite one: ""Married man's last tweet: 'About to go into the champagne room, wish me luck.' "" Heffron: Those are the things that end up, people start passing around and then that's what gets people to go, ""Who is this guy?"" CNN: And Craig, is this what you're chasing? The same idea, those one-liners that get tossed out? Shoemaker: Yeah, I'm a storyteller, so it's not so great for me. I'm still working on this under-140 characters thing. CNN: I did pull out one of yours that I liked too. You wrote, ""Up late in my Pittsburgh hotel, just read a USA today article about how Twitter is no good for intimacy. No worries. I'm alone."" Shoemaker: I don't know if anybody's laughing at the jokes. I tweeted that last night. We'll see how that goes. CNN: Is that part of what's hard about Twitter? When you're doing this, you don't have that kind of instant feedback. You know, if you're doing standup somewhere, you've got the laughter. How do you know? It's like doing this in an echo chamber. Shoemaker: It's the replies. To me, I judge by the replies. Heffron: I've had zero replies. So apparently, I got to work on my tweeting. The whole thing is, when you write, though, it's different. It doesn't have the nuance or things like that. Like I put something about my ex-wife that I got divorced and ""tonight's show is a benefit show and all proceeds go to my ex-wife."" And people are writing back, ""Oh, I feel so sorry for you,"" and I go, ""No, it's a joke."" Shoemaker: Yeah. Criss Angel was on my flight, so I tweeted ""Criss Angel is on our flight. We will not have to use fuel. He will use his superpowers to get us home."" And the replies were, I spelled Criss Angel's name wrong. It's like, come on, people! How am I supposed? You know, that's not the point! CNN: The previous generations never had this problem. No one's never, until really the last few years, no one's ever dealt with the opportunities and the challenges that you guys have. Is Twitter the new standup? Shoemaker: You know, as a comedian, it's funny now it seems like you have to be funny and be this crazy Internet marketer. How can I let somebody know that I'm coming into whatever city, and Twitter and Facebook and all those things are the best way to do it. Heffron: I hate to see, though, that we're on stage at the Punchline in Atlanta actually tweeting the crowd from the stage. I'm doing my act with my thumbs on my BlackBerry.

99,"(CNN) -- Tim Masters squarely blames Fort Collins, Colorado, police and prosecutors for his inability to land gainful employment and for his not having a wife and kids at this stage in his life. Tim Masters, left, stands with attorney David Wymore, right, before Masters' release from prison last year. In 1987, Masters became the prime suspect in the slaying of Peggy Hettrick, a 37-year-old found in a field near his house. Among the reasons police said they focused on Masters was that he failed to report the body after he found it and his childhood drawings and stories suggested he was fixated on death. Masters was convicted of murder in 1999, but a judge last year threw out the conviction and released him from prison, citing new evidence that did not implicate Masters. Masters now has a lawsuit pending against several police officers, ex-prosecutors and the city. The city of Fort Collins has asked a federal judge to dismiss the case. Now 37, Masters sat down for a phone interview with a CNN reporter who covered his case and subsequent release. He said he still holds a grudge against the police and prosecutors who put him behind bars.  Watch Masters the day after his 2008 release » . He's living in Greeley, Colorado, and doesn't get back to Fort Collins much, but he does love traveling. Most notably, he's traveled to Amsterdam, Netherlands, to appear on a talk show with Richard and Selma Eikelenboom, the Dutch forensic scientists who discovered the DNA evidence that ultimately freed Masters. Things can be tough sometimes, but anything is better than prison, Masters said of his first year as a free man since being imprisoned. CNN: How have things been in the year since your release? Masters: It's a struggle to earn enough money to pay my bills and everything, make a living. Other than that, life is good. CNN: Do you have a job? Masters: I buy stuff at auction and I sell it on eBay. CNN: Do you have trouble finding a job because of your time in jail? Masters: Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it. The first thing that comes up on a background check is ""charges dismissed -- first-degree murder.""  Watch Masters thank those last year who worked to free him » . CNN: How else have you been keeping yourself busy? Masters: Pretty much work. That's it. CNN: Describe a typical day. Masters: The big challenge is, first of all, you've got to find out where the auctions are. Once you get that down, then you go to the auctions. Another disadvantage I have is I'm a little outdated on the prices of things, so I'm thinking things are worth a lot less than what they're going for. So I have to learn what things are worth now. I go to the auction, and I bid on stuff. I try and buy it cheap enough that I can make a profit on it, load it into the truck, bring it back to the house. I have shelves all in my basement full of just odds and ends. I put it all on the shelves. I do research on the computer and find out which ones I can actually make a profit on, and I list those. You list the item on eBay and let it run its course through the auction for usually seven days. If it sells, you pack it and ship it off. If it doesn't sell, you can either re-list it as an auction item, re-list it as a store item or throw it in the trash. CNN: What kind of money do you make in a typical week? Masters: Not enough. CNN: What do you enjoy doing most that you weren't able to do in prison? Masters: Travel. I've been to see my sister about four times since I've been out. She's in California. I have an uncle in Arizona. This goes along with the eBay business. I go down there every once in a while. He has a warehouse full of used restaurant equipment, and I go down there every so often. I go through his warehouse, take pictures of all the new stuff he's got in and I list it on eBay for him. Sometimes it sells, sometimes it doesn't. In April, a TV station over in Amsterdam paid to fly me over there to be on a talk show with Richard and Selma [Eikelenboom] from the DNA lab. That was cool.  Watch a prosecutor explain why Masters' conviction was reversed » . CNN: What did you have the hardest time getting used to after being in prison so long? Masters: Maybe cell phones? Cell phones are everywhere now. They didn't used to be so common. I had a cell phone before I was arrested, but the last year before I was arrested, I didn't even keep service on it. Now, I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have a cell phone. It has my calendar, my address book, everything on it. CNN: You spent some prime years of your life -- late 20s, early 30s -- in jail for a crime you didn't commit. What do you think you missed most by not being a free man in those years? Masters: There's so much. Right off the top, I'd say having a family. I think they're very much responsible for me not having a family right now, a wife and kids. But it goes back further than just them arresting me. It goes all the way back to my high school days when they labeled me a murder suspect among all my peers and my teachers and everything. It goes back a long time.  Watch police interrogate a 15-year-old Masters » . CNN: They did the same thing when you were in the military, too, right? Masters: Yeah, in '92. CNN: You said last year that you were staying away from alcohol because you were uncertain what emotions it might stir up. Are you still staying away from booze? Masters: Yeah, that went to hell when I went to Europe. I had a couple beers over in Europe. I didn't get drunk, but we'd have a few beers. CNN: Are you still cautious with your use of alcohol? Masters: Yeah, I think I am. CNN: Why? Masters: No. 1, I don't want a hangover [laughing]. I have a lot of repressed anger from all those years, but I don't think it's going to snap on anybody when I have a couple of beers though. CNN: Any hard feelings toward the Fort Collins Police Department or the prosecutors in the case? Masters: Oh, absolutely. They locked me up for a decade for something I didn't do. Read how DNA pointed to a new killer . CNN: If you could talk to the prosecutors or police who handled your case, what would you say to them? Masters: I don't want to talk to them at all. CNN: Talk about your lawsuit against the prosecutors and police. Who does it target? Masters: Mainly, [former prosecutors, now Judges] Jolene Blair and Terri Gilmore and [Fort Collins police Lt.] Jim Broderick, but there are a few other defendants involved and the city, but in my mind those are the big three.  Key players in the case » . CNN: Tell me about the suit, what it alleges. Masters: You'd probably be better to talk to the lawyers about that. CNN: What would you say to the Hettrick family, which is now left to wonder what happened to their daughter? Masters: I don't know what I'd say to them. It's a damned shame that [the police] did this to them, too, telling them they got the guy when they didn't have the right person. I don't know what I'd say to them. That's a tough question. CNN: Do you get back to Fort Collins much? Masters: I try to stay away from Fort Collins. I still have family over there though, so I'm over there every once in a while. CNN: Does going there bring back bad memories? Masters: Yeah, and every time I go over there I feel like I'm on the defensive, every time I see a police car with someone pulled over or something -- well, let me give you an example. One day, my aunt and I were coming back from having lunch, and we were about to make a left and the road kept going straight. On the other side of the street, they had the yellow police tape up, and this is only two blocks from my aunt's house. I'm thinking, ""Oh great, I wonder when they're going to come interrogate me for something that happened over here."" It turns out the yellow tape was up because there was a telephone pole that was leaning over, but it looked like crime scene tape. I didn't know. But I can't live like that, wondering when they are going to harass me for something that I didn't have anything to do with. They did it to me before. CNN: So you're keeping a low profile? Masters: Yeah, pretty much.",0.5409714,3426
100,"(CNN) -- Why are some people amazingly successful -- and other people with the same intelligence or abilities just part of the crowd? Malcolm Gladwell tries to find out why some people are successful in his new book, ""Outliers."" Malcolm Gladwell, the New Yorker writer who's made a living dissecting questions such as how small trends become major movements (""The Tipping Point"") and the value of snap judgments (""Blink""), was curious about that subject, and -- typically -- set out to find some answers. The result is his new book ""Outliers"" (Little, Brown), which finds parallels between the Beatles, Bill Gates and Canadian hockey players -- as well as reasons why planes operated by members of particular cultures have a greater likelihood of crashing. John Roberts of CNN's ""American Morning"" spoke to Gladwell on Friday. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: We always think that it's the smartest people that become the most successful. You postulate in this new book [that] it's not always intelligence that leads to success. You say ""it's not the brightest who succeed, it's rather a gift. Outliers are those given opportunities who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them."" But there are also some commonalities with these outliers. Malcolm Gladwell: Yes. I'm really interested in things like the effects of generation. So what does it mean? I have a chapter that looks at some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. And almost all of them are born in 1955: Steve Jobs at Apple, Bill Gates at Microsoft, Bill Joy -- who is one of those famous programmers -- a bunch of guys at Sun Microsystems. The argument there is that they were 21 when the computer revolution hit, and that's how old you want to be when you're confronted with a new revolution. That's the kind of pattern that you see, over and over again, when you look at the lives of very successful people. That it's not just their own abilities, it's being in the right place at the right time, it's coming from a certain kind of culture, it's having certain built-in advantages. CNN: There were also some happy accidents along the way. For example, if Bill Gates hadn't been put into a private school, which actually had a computer -- one of the first schools to ever have a computer -- perhaps he may not have become the mogul that he was. Gladwell: Yes, he has this incredible childhood. ... I talked to him, and he was going through the extraordinary one-in-a-million lucky breaks that characterized his childhood. He got to start programming on a computer in 1968 as a 13-year-old when nobody was programming. So he was way ahead of the crowd by the time he starts Microsoft. CNN: You and I both lived in Canada, developed a love for Canadian hockey, and you found by looking at Canadian hockey teams that there's a certain commonality between all of the best players, at least in the junior hockey league system, which I imagine translates to the pros as well. Gladwell: Oh, absolutely. An extraordinary number of hockey players who are professionals are born in January, February and March. And that's because the cutoff date for age-class hockey is January 1st. So when they go to ... recruit kids for all-star teams when they're 8 or 9 years old, they think they're choosing the most talented ones, but actually they're choosing the biggest ones. Because if you're born in January and you're 8, you're a lot taller, more mature and taller and bigger and stronger than someone born in December. CNN: Because development is much faster there -- . Gladwell: At that age, and so that advantage you get as an 8-year-old, you get plucked out and given proper coaching and more games and more practice -- and by the time you're 18, you actually are better. CNN: Another fascinating finding is that you are more likely to be in a plane crash if the pilot comes from a particular country. What's that all about? Gladwell: Yes. That's a fascinating thing. The single most important variable in determining whether a plane crashes is not the plane, it's not the maintenance, it's not the weather, it's the culture the pilot comes from. Planes are flown safely when the pilot and co-pilot are in open and honest communication. And in cultures where it is difficult for a junior person to speak openly to a superior, you have lots of plane crashes. CNN: And you said the Avianca crash here in [New York's] Oyster Bay ... is a very clear example of that. Gladwell: Where the co-pilot was so intimidated by air traffic control, he could not tell them they were running out of fuel, and they crashed. They just go around and crashed. CNN: Some of the ideas of this book were criticized by The New York Times, which said the book ""is glib, poorly reasoned, thoroughly unconvincing. Much of what Mr. Gladwell has to say about superstars is little more than common sense: that talent alone is not enough to assure success, that opportunity, hard work, timing and luck play important roles as well."" What do you say about that? Gladwell: I don't think -- I start from a very common-sense premise, but it takes you in all kinds of interesting areas. I wouldn't say that you know the stuff about pilots, the stuff about hockey players being born in January, it doesn't sound like common sense to me. So you know, I think what's interesting about this book is I take a series of ideas which we all know, and then I say, look, it's more complicated and more interesting and more fascinating than we would have ever imagined. CNN: Anything we can do to try to employ some of these techniques? Gladwell: Well, the end of the book talks about what we should be doing as a country. It's less about what we can do. When we understand that success is so much a part of the world of which we're a part, we move away from this idea that's about self-help and we move towards this idea that it's time for us to be providing opportunities to a group.",0.5286592,1643

The woman nicknamed ""Supernova"" tells My City_My Life about her tough childhood, her love of Moscow and why Russian vodka is the best. CNN: How would you describe Moscow? Natalia Vodianova: It's a city of contrasts. You have this great culture and traditions that are very normal, calm and established. And then you have explosions of emotion, craziness, art, and young people who are so proud to be Muscovites and really trying to be individuals. Moscow is a huge inspiration for me. I love what I find here, I love being here. CNN: What would you change about Moscow given the chance? NV: Definitely the way it's treated at the moment, the way the government wants to renovate the old buildings. To me it's a little bit sad because in the West people have a very different mentality about renovating buildings, keeping them as intact as possible. Watch Natalia Vodianova take CNN on a tour of Moscow. » . CNN: What's the fashion in Moscow? NV: You see women in jeans wearing very high heels and a short puffy jacket. It's really funny! CNN: Tell me about your childhood . NV: I was born in Nizhny Novgorod to a very poor family and unfortunately my father and mother separated when I was very little. She was a single mum and had two more girls. It was a struggle but we all worked really hard and stood up for each other. My mum was amazing; she never drank, she never smoked -- she lived for us. I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me. CNN: Is family very important to you? NV: I think protecting your family and giving to them is so important. It's the most important achievement. CNN: How did your modeling career take off? NV: I went to Paris when I was 17. I was lucky because my career kind of gradually built up over two years -- I always had good work but I wasn't a star straight away. In fact, my agency thought that I might never do shows because I was a bit shorter and not skinny enough, but when I gave birth to my first son I was 19 and I lost a lot of weight. I guess the stress on the body was extreme and I suddenly just turned into this stick -- just the way designers love models. My career took off after Lucas was born because I opened a lot of shows on the runway and that's where a lot of stars are made in my industry. See Natalia Vodianova's Moscow in photos. » . CNN: If you weren't a model, what would your life be like? NV: It's very hard to say what my life would be like if I hadn't gone to Paris. People say I didn't change very much but I don't think that's true. I'm a happy person and even if I thought that I was happy then, I had so much baggage to carry with me: my background, people's expectations, the fact that I wasn't a perfect student and I wasn't going to school all the time -- I didn't live a normal life at all. That's not with me anymore, because of my success. It really doesn't matter because I know I have learned so much more than a lot of other girls who have had perfect childhoods. CNN: Tell us about the charity and what you are trying to achieve with it? NV: I started my foundation in 2005, after the Beslan tragedy [the 2004 school siege in which at least 339 hostages were killed]. I was in Moscow at the  time and it just struck me so much. I went back to New York, where I was living at the time, organized a fundraising event and raised $350,000 to build a playground for the children that had survived in the area. I believe that play is very therapeutic. It's really the only way for these children to forget about what happened and just be children, even if it's only for five minutes. But then I realized that it would be good for all the other children in Russia and I just started raising money and building playgrounds. Now we have 23 places all over Russia and we are building 15 more this year and planning to build more. I want to fulfill my dream of building 500 play parks in Russia. Each one will cost about $300,000 so it's a big dream -- an expensive one! CNN: Let's talk about vodka... NV: Our vodka is definitely the best. It's a very pure, good drink and it goes with Russian food. Generally I don't drink vodka outside Russia, but when you come to Russia there is no reason to order a glass of wine.

102,"Editor's note: Nancy Grace is the host of ""Nancy Grace"" on HLN nightly at 8 and 10 p.m. ET. Read an excerpt from her new novel ""The Eleventh Victim"" published by Hyperion. Nancy Grace found it challenging to complete her first novel, ""The Eleventh Victim."" (CNN) -- Readers of Nancy Grace's debut novel, ""The Eleventh Victim,"" would be forgiven if they assumed the main character is based on Grace. After all, the heroine of the novel becomes an Atlanta, Georgia, district attorney after her fiancé is murdered and later relocates to New York for a fresh start. But Grace said there are some differences between her and her protagonist. ""Hailey is a much better person than I am,"" Grace said. The tough-as-nails anchor of the HLN show that bears her name was driven to complete her first book of fiction, which she said has been in the works for almost a decade. The novel centers on the character of Hailey Dean, a psychology student who becomes a prosecutor after the tragic murder of her fiancé just weeks before their wedding. The mystery takes flight when Dean, having relocated to Manhattan and trained as a therapist, discovers that her patients are being murdered in a copycat style of an Atlanta serial killer from her past. Grace -- who is also the author of the nonfiction book ""Objection!"" -- recently spoke to CNN about the challenges of giving birth to both twins and a thriller, who might die in her next novel and what she thinks about television shows like ""Saturday Night Live"" parodying her. CNN: You are a working mother of two year-old twins. How in the world did you find time to write a book? Nancy Grace: It was hard work. I had done ""Objection"" and I had an idea for a second nonfiction. I went back to my editor and I said ""Here's an idea for another nonfiction."" She said ""Yeah, it's OK, you got anything else?"" I said ""No, but I do have an old manuscript I've been working on for a long time, a murder mystery."" I told her it's not finished yet, I have about 300 pages. I took it over that day and the next day they told me they wanted a two-book series on Hailey Dean. Then I thought ""Oh Lord, now I've got to finish it."" That happened around the time I got pregnant.  Watch Nancy discuss her new book » . I had a difficult pregnancy. I was in a wheelchair, I threw up every day, I broke my foot during the pregnancy, so a lot of crazy things happened. Finally, after the twins came, the deadline came. I literally had to sit in the bed with the computer and force myself to finish it. I knew what was going to happen in each of the four storylines, but I had to get there. I would be up sometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning. The twins, one would wake up, by the time I would get that one fed and down, the other one would wake up and then it was time to get up at 5:30. CNN: You said you knew who did it in terms of the mystery early on in the writing. So how did the book change during its development? Grace: The characters really developed. It's like getting to know a person. Read an excerpt from the novel . There are certain things Hailey simply would not do. You get to know your characters and they become richer and more intricate because you get to know the character. I would not do anything that was out of character for them. CNN: The plot and the settings sound very familiar to your own life. How much of you is in Hailey? Grace: Hailey is a much better person than I am, I can tell you that much. She's very brave. She thinks her way out of difficult and almost impossible situations, she's courageous and she's witty. I would say it's loosely based, but she's a much better heroine than I could ever be. CNN: What is more difficult, writing nonfiction or fiction? Grace: It is definitely harder to write fiction. With nonfiction you deal with facts already in existence, but with fiction you have to create everything. Details like what color somebody's hair was to how hot it was that day. A lot of ideas for the book would come to me in the middle of the night and I forgot some of them so often that I now sleep with my two BlackBerrys near the bed. I've learned my lesson the hard way, so I will now write myself my book notes in the middle of the night. CNN: Is there anything that didn't make it into this book that you wished had? Grace: Yes, but don't worry because I saved it for the next book, which will be set in the television industry. There's going to be a lot of dead TV executives (laughing). CNN: They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so what are your thoughts on having been parodied? Grace: It's funny to me. Everything from YouTube to ""Boston Legal"" and ""Saturday Night Live."" It's very flattering that they would think enough to make fun of me. I want [rapper] Eminem to make fun of me, but I don't think it would be very nice (laughing).",0.52624,5619
104,"(CNN)  -- The Wu-Tang Clan -- the New York hip-hop supergroup that spawned millions of album sales, nine solo acts and a few acting careers -- almost never was. If RZA, left, had been jailed or Method Man killed, Wu-Tang may have never formed, RZA says. Method Man, the group's most recognizable voice, was nearly killed before the band formed, Wu-Tang's chief producer, RZA, writes in his forthcoming memoir. Meth was walking to buy marijuana at 160 Park Hill Avenue in Staten Island -- the house in Wu-Tang's ""Protect Ya Neck"" video -- when RZA saw him across the street, he writes in the book. ""Come over here, yo!"" RZA beckoned, according to ""The Tao of Wu"" (Riverhead). ""He stopped and came running over. A few seconds later -- pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! -- a guy started shooting up the front of 160. A buddy of ours, Poppy, an innocent, school-going, nice guy -- he was shot and killed right there.""  Interactive: Where's the Wu been? » . It wasn't the only close call RZA said could have snuffed the band that rewrote the rule book for hip-hop acts. The year before the group formed in 1993, RZA was acquitted on an attempted murder charge that could have put him behind bars for eight years, he writes in ""The Tao of Wu,"" out Thursday. Expanding on the book's anecdotes in an interview with CNN, RZA explained that if he had been imprisoned or if Method Man, aka Clifford Smith, had been killed, the band never would have come to fruition. RZA, whose real name is Robert Diggs and whose stage name is pronounced ""Rizza,"" also talked about his role in the death of his cousin, Russell Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard or ODB. Two days before his 36th birthday in 2004, ODB died in a New York recording studio from an overdose of cocaine and painkillers. RZA writes in the book that he once witnessed ODB force his own son to watch him do drugs. RZA tried to leave, he writes, but ODB wouldn't let him. Now, RZA told CNN, he wishes he would've been tougher with ODB about his drug problem. Following are excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for language, flow and length: . CNN: Could your imprisonment or Method Man's death have derailed Wu-Tang's formation? RZA: Either one of those incidents could definitely have derailed it. Of course, myself being the abbot, the one who came with the idea, if I wouldn't have made it out of that tumultuous time -- it seemed like I wasn't going to make it out of it; there was a lot of odds against me -- but we stood strong, and self-defense made sense to the jury. We beat that ... It was the victory over that incident that made me change my whole direction. In a way, it's double-edged in that incident. One, if I would've lost that, yeah, Wu-Tang wouldn't have happened, but also it's the victory of it that inspired me and gave me the drive also to go and really get serious about Wu-Tang and the things I was dealing with. Same thing with Meth, he always brings it up ... that that day saved his life. He actually said, if it was anybody else calling him, he wouldn't have came. CNN: In the book, you cite lessons from Eastern religions, Christianity, Islam, [Nation of Islam offshoot] Five Percent, numerology, comic books, kung fu, chess. What would you say to someone who says it's difficult to reconcile these dogmas? RZA: Like it says in the Bible, ""In the beginning was the word, and the word became flesh"" -- if we go to the root of the word, we will find that, yeah, everything is similar. Everything is teaching us all the same path. It's just that one religion was good for these people because of their living conditions. In the Quran, they mention paradise being filled with wells, wells of water, and if you're in the desert and you've got a chance to get water and gardens -- as they describe paradise in the holy Quran -- if you're going to get gardens, that's the paradise that fits your situation. ... Everything they're saying relates to the people they're talking to. ... You remove the messenger and take the message. CNN: You say in the book that your penchant for violent lyrics in your younger years ""was a product of my history and environment"" and that it no longer represents you. But you also say you won't repudiate violence. Why not? RZA: One reason I haven't repudiated it is because when it's necessary, it's necessary. [The Bible's] Ecclesiastes tell us there's a time for everything -- a time for war, a time for peace -- so in times for war, there's time for violence. Then in [the Hindu scripture] Bhagavad Gita, it says Arjuna was talking, Arjuna didn't want to commit violent acts against an army that was attacking him. He couldn't find it in his heart to do it. It was people he loved. He didn't want to get into violence, but Krishna had to point out to him, ""Your duty is your duty."" ... So, to me, violence in the light of justice is still violent, but I don't see it the same. It's because of justice that I don't repudiate violence because justice must be served somehow. CNN: ODB was a product of his environment as well. To what degree were you and other Wu-Tang members responsible for his death? RZA: The guys would say it's more me than them because they say that's my cousin and I was right there. If you let a man that you love or anybody -- man, woman or child that you love -- sit there and destroy themselves in front of you, you're neglecting them ... Everybody let him do what he wanted to do. ... There were times when I took his drugs and threw them down the toilet. When I do that, he would get so pissed off I don't see him for weeks after that. ... So it got to a point, I was like, ""[expletive] it, let him do his drugs"" just to have him around me, just to keep him there. ... But it's still neglect, yo. CNN: You say you ran Wu-Tang like a dictatorship in its first five years. I know you and Raekwon have had creative differences and Ghostface Killah is suing you over royalties. Ever regret the dictatorship approach? RZA: I don't regret it because it got us to the power we are. ... To me, in the beginning, the dictatorship led us to such a strong foundation that even though Wu-Tang seemed to be crumbling, it didn't fall because of the root foundation of one man's idea. But now as it's coming back together -- we're living in the twilight age of it right now -- it's still surviving because of the democracy of it. CNN: Wu-Tang is still around, but nothing like the heyday of the 1990s. Will we ever see a renaissance? RZA: Well, to me, Wu-Tang is beyond Wu-Tang Clan. ... It's just like hip-hop is beyond Grandmaster Flash, but Grandmaster Flash was one of the first guys to hit those turntables like that. ... The same thing with Wu-Tang. You'll see the difference in hip-hop from the moment we came in to before we came in. We changed it. We changed the whole structure. CNN: Have you accomplished everything you've set out to accomplish? RZA: I'm me and the me that's me is me and is going to continue to be me, and it's always reaching and growing. I'm grateful for what I've accomplished. I'm grateful for anyone who thinks I accomplished something and says, ""Well he did this; he did that."" I'm proud to be accepted, but I feel like I've just scratched the surface for some weird reason. CNN's Kyle Almond contributed to this report.",0.52353394,7651

Jay-Z tells Oprah Winfrey a conversation with his father freed him ""one hundred percent."" Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed. The rapper, now 39, was born Shawn Carter in Brooklyn, New York. His albums include ""Reasonable Doubt,"" ""The Black Album"" and the just-released ""The Blueprint 3."" Jay-Z also owns a portion of the NBA's New Jersey Nets and founded, with Damon Dash, the clothing line Rocawear. Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life. The following is an edited version of the interview. Oprah Winfrey: When you were 5, your family moved to the Marcy projects -- and then your father left when you were 11. When you look back at that, what did your 11-year-old self feel? Jay-Z: Anger. At the whole situation. Because when you're growing up, your dad is your superhero. Once you've let yourself fall that in love with someone, once you put him on such a high pedestal and he lets you down, you never want to experience that pain again. So I remember just being really quiet and really cold. Never wanting to let myself get close to someone like that again. I carried that feeling throughout my life, until my father and I met up before he died. Oprah: Wow. I've never heard a man phrase it that way. You know, I've done many shows about divorce, and the real crime is when the kids aren't told. They just wake up one day and their dad is gone. Did that happen to you? Jay-Z: We were told our parents would separate, but the reasons weren't explained. My mom prepared us more than he did. I don't think he was ready for that level of discussion and emotion. He was a guy who was pretty detached from his feelings. Oprah: Did you wonder why he left? Jay-Z: I summed it up that they weren't getting along. There was a lot of arguing. Oprah: And did you know you were angry? Jay-Z: Yeah. I also felt protective of my mom. I remember telling her, ""Don't worry, when I get big, I'm going to take care of this."" I felt like I had to step up. I was 11 years old, right? But I felt I had to make the situation better. Oprah: How did that change you? Jay-Z: It made me not express my feelings as much. I was already a shy kid, and it made me a little reclusive. But it also made me independent. And stronger. It was a weird juxtaposition. Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder. Did your father's leaving have anything to do with that? Did it turn you into the kind of angry kid who would end up shooting his brother? Jay-Z: Yes -- and my brother was dealing with a lot of demons. Oprah: How old was he? Jay-Z: About 16. He was doing a lot of drugs. He was taking stuff from our family. I was the youngest, but I felt like I needed to protect everybody. Oprah: So how did you get back in touch with your father? Jay-Z: My mom set up a meeting. And now I realize why -- it makes all the sense in the world. I remember very distinctly that I had a conversation with her in my kitchen. I was saying, ""You know, Ma, I've really been trying to look inward, and maybe I'm just not meant to fall in love like other people do."" She just looked at me like, ""Hush up, boy."" Oprah: Wow. Jay-Z: And I guess from that point, she figured out what was wrong with me, and she planned a meeting between me and my father. I was like, ""Ma, I'm a grown man. I don't need a dad now."" Oprah: You didn't feel a hole in your soul? Jay-Z: I never looked at that. I guess I didn't want to deal with it. Because, you know, once I looked, I'd have to do something about it. And I guess I still had too much resentment and anger. Oprah: In one of your songs, you wrote that you weren't sure if your father even remembered your birthday is in December. Jay-Z: I believed that. When I was a kid, I once waited for him on a bench. He never showed up. Even as an adult, that affected me. So when my mom set up this meeting, I told her he wouldn't come -- and the first time, he didn't. At that point, I was really done, but Mom pushed for another meeting, because she's just a beautiful soul. Oprah: The second time, your father showed up. Jay-Z: He showed up. And I gave him the real conversation. I told him how I felt the day he left. He was saying stuff like ""Man, you knew where I was."" I'm like, ""I was a kid! Do you realize how wrong you were? It was your responsibility to see me."" He finally accepted that. Oprah: Where had he been? Jay-Z: At his mom's house 10 minutes away from me. That was the sad part. Oprah: Was there any explanation he could have offered that would have satisfied you? Jay-Z: Yes -- and that's why we were able to mend our relationship. Oprah: What was his reason? Jay-Z: When I was 9, my dad's brother got stabbed, and my dad went looking for the guy who did it. People would call in the middle of the night and tell him, ""So-and-so is out here."" So my dad would get up, get his gun, and go outside to look for the guy. After a while, my mom was like, ""Hey, this is your family now. You can't do that."" But this was my dad's baby brother. And my dad was in so much pain that he started using drugs and became a different person. So I understand that the trauma of the event, coupled with the drugs, caused him to lose his soul. Oprah: When you saw him again, had he come back to himself? Jay-Z: He was broken. He had a bad liver, and he knew that if he continued drinking, it would kill him. But he didn't stop. Oprah: How soon after you saw him did he die? Jay-Z: A couple of months. I got him an apartment, I was buying furniture. And he passed away. Oprah: Did you instantly make peace with him during that conversation? Jay-Z: Pretty much. I felt lighter. Oprah: The conversation freed you in ways that you hadn't been free before? Jay-Z: One hundred percent. Oprah: Did it open the door for you to have a life with love in it? Jay-Z: Absolutely. Oprah: So what's your personal creed? Jay-Z: Be true to yourself -- and keep things simple. People complicate things. Oprah: My creed is that intention creates reality. Jay-Z: Now I'm having an aha moment! That's true. OPRAH.com: The top 20 things Oprah knows for sure . Oprah: What's the basis of your spiritual belief? Jay-Z: I believe in karma: What you do to others comes back to you. Oprah: But don't you think we're responsible only for what we know? Otherwise, you'd be facing karma for every person you sold drugs to. Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better. But now, if I were to act as if what I did wasn't bad, that would be irresponsible. And I'd have to bear the weight of that. Oprah: Maya Angelou always says, ""When you know better, you do better."" Do you still think back on that time in your life? Jay-Z: All the time. When you make music, you're constantly on the psychiatrist's couch, so to speak. That's an outlet for me. Because I'm not normally a talkative person. I don't have conversations like this for no reason. OPRAH.com: Read the entire exclusive interview from O, The Oprah Magazine .

107,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natasha Richardson, the Tony Award-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting clan, died Wednesday from injuries suffered in a ski accident. She was 45. Comedian Joan Rivers says actress Natasha Richardson had ""such a family."" On Wednesday night's ""Larry King Live,"" comedian Joan Rivers remembered Richardson for her marriage to actor Liam Neeson and used her sharp wit to recall her own skiing experience. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: You knew Natasha Richardson. What was your reaction? Joan Rivers: Oh, [it] shouldn't have happened. We were more acquaintances than friends. But we spent one amazing day on a boat with my whole family and she and Liam and the boys. And they were such a family. King: What was the occasion? Rivers: We were all in the Caribbean, and we all kind of knew each other from dinner parties and so forth. And we met at the airport, and we said, ""Oh, let's get together, with the kids."" And it was one of those wonderful days. We laughed and talked and had lunch, and the kids were jumping off the boat and we were drinking wine. She was just amazing and darling. King: Have you seen her work on Broadway? Rivers: I've seen her work. I love actresses who go back and forth. I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in ""The Philadelphia Story"" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that. King: What was your read on them as a couple that day? Rivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That's what kills me. I mean [it] just shouldn't have happened. ... And they made such a good-looking couple, too. He doted on what she said, she doted on -- it was just perfect. King: How did you learn of this yesterday? Rivers: One of our mutual friends called me and said, do you know about -- I just saw them recently in the thing that Prince Charles gave in England, and a mutual friend said, did you heard about what happened to Natasha? I said, what are you talking about? And he said, she's brain-dead.  Watch King talk to celebrities about Richardson » . King: So you knew yesterday? Rivers: I knew yesterday. And I knew yesterday that she was brain-dead. And I was told, which is, again, so dear, that they kept her alive purposely to bring her back to New York, so that the boys could say goodbye to her before -- . King: Really? Rivers: Yes. King: That's both beautiful and sad. Rivers: Look at this, it gets me crazy. It's sad. King: Do you ski? Rivers: I had a terrible fall about 12 years ago. And I lay there in the snow and I said to myself, ""If I get up, I'm not coming back and I got up."" King: You're like, ""Goodbye."" Rivers: Goodbye. And I swear to you, I laid on the ground and I go, ""If everything works, that's it. That's it."" King: You've heard the doctor. What do you make of this? There must have been something previously. It was a slight fall? Rivers: You don't know; you hit your head wrong. You walk out of your house and it's over. We all know that, especially at this age. You understand that it's over, it's gone. It's just not that [Richardson's] age, not with a good marriage, not with two young boys. It shouldn't be. King: John Kennedy said life isn't fair. Rivers: It isn't. It isn't. And anyone who doesn't get up in the morning and say, ""How lucky I am,"" is an idiot.",0.52227044,2709
109,"(CNN)  -- Jordan Belfi has a great job: He plays Adam Davies on the HBO show ""Entourage,"" a comedy series that takes a look at the life of a young actor, Vincent Chase, and the old friends who surround him in Hollywood. Jordan Belfi arrives at the premiere of ""Entourage"" season six in Los Angeles, California. Davies is one of the few characters on the show who has the ability to shake one of the central figures: the unshakeable agent Ari Gold. Belfi has been around since the early days of ""Entourage"" and remembers the humble beginnings of his character's career as an agent under Gold's direction. Since that first season, Davies has risen to become Ari's chief rival on the show. Belfi believes conveying the tension between him and Ari is easy, based on the great material he's given. ""It's a testament to the writing by Doug Ellin, the creator of the show. It's just on the page,"" Belfi said. ""When you get setups and writing and dialogue and scenes that good, it makes your job that much easier."" CNN talked to Belfi, who's also in the movie ""Surrogates"" (opening Friday), about his experiences on the show and his inspiration for the role. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN:  A lot of fans really missed that rivalry between you and Ari Gold. Talk a little about how you and Jeremy Piven kind of prepare for that and try to make that real on screen. Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons. Ari is an entertaining character, and it's fun to watch him go after things, but people really enjoy kind of when Ari's off balance. That interplay, that back and forth, particularly the sort of thing that's happening now [on the show], the constantly one-upping each other, is just really fun to watch. It's entertaining. And I get that response from a lot of the fans of the show. They love Adam Davies for that reason because he just knows how to do it. Jeremy ... [is] an actor with so much power and force and impact that you're sort of forced to up your game. You're really present in the moment. And when you're there and you're really going back and forth, that's when the sparks really fly. CNN: Talk little bit about the inspiration you draw from to play Adam Davies. Belfi: I started way back on season one in the beginning of the show. And back then, Adam Davies was still in his cubicle. So a lot of the inspiration came from meetings I had when I was starting out -- you know, behavior I experienced from agents and other industry people when I was starting out. I was in a not-too-dissimilar position. ... And I think that's what people really respond to. There's an absolute foundation of truth -- almost scary truth -- to the things Adam says, the things Ari does, all that kind of stuff. And it's why it's such a visceral experience for people in the industry and fun for people that happen not to be in the industry. CNN: What are your thoughts on Adam Davies as a person? Belfi: What gives Ari a little bit of his soul, his heart, is that we have all these scenes with his wife and his family, and you really get to see him as a dad. ... [But] we haven't gotten to see any of the personal life of Adam Davies. So I don't know if there's anything yet to kind of balance out those ruthless qualities he has. But I think he's the kind of agent that I'd certainly like to have if you're that actor trying to go after that job. You want that agent who's going to beg, borrow and steal to help prove that you're the guy. So in that respect, it seems like he's someone you'd want on your side. And the thing is, I think that's what made the rivalry between him and Ari so great. You know when he was coming up, he probably did a lot of the same things [as Ari] and ran over people in similar kinds of ways. They're really kind of the same in a lot of ways. So you're either best friends or mortal enemies when you share that much in common with somebody. CNN: Exempting Davies, who's your favorite character on the show and why? Belfi: Ah! Impossible question! I have to exempt Adam Davies from the answer? ... If I absolutely, gun-to-my-head have to choose, there's a quality about [Chase's brother] Drama that I've always loved. And it was maybe more prominent in the first couple of seasons than it is now because it's evolved slightly. The quality that I always found the most entertaining, is that Drama was always this mix of desperation and simultaneous pride. And that's really funny. You know at the beginning he was just scratching, begging for something, some chunk of the game or to get back in the game. But he simultaneously kind of knows it all. And that mix is a great comedic mix, comedic recipe. It was both funny and heartbreaking.   CNN: Of course, our diehard ""Entourage"" fans would love to get some scoop on the coming story lines. You've gotta give us something. Belfi: A little something? Well, I don't think I'd be giving away too much to say that Adam might get Lloyd. In terms of the story line, there's some stuff that I'm told with Drama and his going after this role on ""Melrose Place"" and the screen test for that role and the ups and downs of that. And also, some big things happen between Eric and Sloane. But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ... In the amazing way that Doug has constructed it, all that stuff from the end of season two comes full circle. There's this one thing that happens that will really stand out and that people will talk about. So some fun, exciting stuff to look forward to.",0.5213269,6425
111,"(CNN) -- The box office fright flick ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" earned $23 million and a second-place ranking the first weekend of its release, satiating the moviegoer appetite for psychological thrills. Carmen Reed's family lived in a former funeral home.  Their stories inspired ""The Haunting in Connecticut."" But what is entertainment for many was reportedly true life for Carmen Reed, who insists on using her maiden name to protect her children and grandchildren. Reed, her husband and four children rented an old colonial home in Southington, Connecticut, in the mid-1980s in order to be close to a hospital where her 13-year-old son was receiving cancer treatment. Soon after, two nieces also joined them in the house that they learned had once been a funeral home. It wasn't long before that son began telling stories about noises he'd heard and visions he'd seen, including the one of the ""tall, thin man with long jet-black hair"" whom the boy said he saw every night, Reed said. ""I was the biggest skeptic of all,"" she explained. ""I put my son in a mental hospital because I didn't believe him.""  Watch Reed talk about life in a haunted house » . Reed sat down with CNN to talk about the spooky stories that later became her own and how what her family experienced inspired a blockbuster film. CNN: Tell me more about sending your son to a mental institution, where he arrived in a straitjacket and where you say he stayed for 45 days. Why did you do this, and what happened next? Carmen Reed: At first I thought it was his cancer treatment. ... I took him to a psychologist, but he got darker and darker. And this one time, he got so bad, he attacked my niece. ... An ambulance came and took him to a mental hospital. ... He was saying, ""Mom, don't leave me! It's going to come after you now."" And it did. CNN: You mentioned seeing a hand that grasped your niece and that mop water would turn a deep, dark red. What are some other things you saw or heard? Reed: Mattresses would breathe. They had a pulse. ... There was the normal banging on walls, but it always came in threes. ... There was a deep, gravelly voice. CNN: And yet you stayed for two years! If what you were experiencing didn't drive you to move away, what did? Reed: I couldn't go to the grocery store without people telling me their ghost stories. I was usually there for three hours. CNN: You talk about how you read from the Bible in an attempt to drive away demons. How did your experiences in this home influence your faith? Reed: I've learned that most people just believe in this physical world. Some people question if there is a God or angels or demons. I don't need to question that. I found that answer in this house. CNN: Are you still haunted by your experiences in that home? Reed: I do dream about it, and I remember things, but one of the biggest mottos I have is ""Be not afraid."" When people are afraid to go somewhere, I'll go into the deepest, darkest part of it because I know I'm not alone. CNN: You've consulted on this new film and are writing a book about your story. Why do you insist on using your maiden name? Reed: To protect my children. ... My daughter was more scarred by the publicity than she was by the house. And I have 11 grandchildren, and I want to protect them. CNN: What lesson do you hope people will take away from the film and the increased exposure to what you experienced in that Connecticut home? Reed: Leave the occult alone. You think you can control it, but it's going to backfire on you.",0.5145511,6373
112,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Coagulated sheep's blood. Pig knuckles. Snake bile. Fried crickets. Sound like ingredients you might see bubbling away in a caldron, right? Zane Lamprey raises a toast to alcoholic beverages the world over. Well, these are just some of the unusual items Zane Lamprey has eaten -- yes, eaten -- during the course of his day job. No, he's not a human garbage disposal. Lamprey is a comedian who hosts a TV program about drinking, ""Three Sheets."" The show follows him all over the world as he samples local libations. Lamprey also claims to be in search of the ultimate hangover cure, which is why he's often called upon to ingest the indigestible. Not that the drinks are any better. Anyone for a shot of Belize rum that's had a dead snake fermenting in it for about a year? If the locals drink it, so will Lamprey. ""I'll try anything once,"" he said, adding that ""there's certainly a lot that I won't drink twice.""  Watch Lamprey use sword to open champagne » . Gross stuff aside, Lamprey has what many consider to be a dream job. And although he occasionally gets a little bleary-eyed, the Californian maintains that it's not a show about getting inebriated. ""I drink to try new things, to learn about drinking cultures or new drinks,"" Lamprey said. ""Sometimes levels of inebriation are the by-product of my job, but I'm certainly not going out looking to do that. If I did I think I'd be the wrong person for the job."" We caught up with Lamprey in New York's Bubble Lounge, where he was preparing (soberly, mind you) to use a sword to lop off the end of a champagne bottle, glass neck and all. It's a ritual he says started in the Napoleonic era as a way to celebrate victories at battle. While Lamprey might not be as battle-scarred as Napoleon's men, he does have a victory to celebrate: ""Three Sheets"" has a new home after being put in limbo for several months after its original network went off the air. The show now airs on the Fine Living Network, which has just popped the cork on ""Three Sheets' "" fourth season. New episodes air Monday nights at 10 p.m. ET and repeat throughout the week. Besides demonstrating how one sabers champagne, Lamprey talked to CNN about dealing with thumping hangovers, staying in shape and other challenges of hosting a TV show about alcohol. The following is an edited version of the transcript. CNN: Do you consider yourself a professional drinker? Zane Lamprey: I get paid to drink. If I got paid to play baseball, I'd be a professional baseball player, right? Yeah. So I guess I am a professional drinker. CNN: By now you must have discovered a cure for a hangover. Lamprey: There is no cure. Actually, there's two. Either don't drink, or don't stop. Once you break one of those, you get into trouble. We've found remedies, things that'll make it a little easier. I've jumped in freezing water, I've done just about everything, and nothing has wiped out my hangover. CNN: Where were you when you had your worst hangover? Lamprey: Oddly enough, I was in a place that I was promised by several people I would not get a hangover: Champagne, France. They said if you drink good champagne, you can drink as much as you want, and you won't get a hangover. So I put it to the test, and the next day, I had the worst hangover yet. It was horrible. Oh. So bad. CNN: In Iceland, you drank something called ""Black Death,"" the same name given to the pandemic that nearly wiped out Europe centuries ago. Taste good? Lamprey: I'm sure it tasted better than the plague, but not by much. It tasted like something that people shouldn't want to drink, like vodka mixed with black licorice and dirt. When I stepped off the plane, I was dying to try it. Then once I tried it, I was dying to drink something to get that taste out of my mouth. CNN: You've said that one of the worst things you've had to drink was viper rum in Belize, which had a dead snake soaking in it. What does a snake taste like? Lamprey: A dead snake tastes like what a dead snake smells like. When I actually had to smell the shot, which I was told not to do, I almost hurled. I managed to get it down, and I think I chased it with a piece of watermelon rolled in sugar. CNN: What does your doctor say about the state of your liver? Lamprey: I have one. It's sitting on my counter at home, and it's completely fine. ... When I finished this last season, I did go and get a full checkup, and I'm completely fine. CNN: How do you stay in shape while shooting ""Three Sheets""? Lamprey: I don't. Go look at a clip of me doing the show. I'm probably about 23 pounds heavier. I have taken my shirt off, and when I watch that sometimes I get a little, ""Oh, God."" But that makes me an everyman. People want to see an everyman. They don't want to see some guy who's all put together, which clearly I'm not. I don't profess to know anything about booze. I learn it from the people that show me. CNN: Do you find that generally everybody's attitude toward drinking is the same the world over? Lamprey: Absolutely. Everyone drinks to enjoy themselves. Everyone goes out with their friends because they're looking to have a good time. That's the same everywhere. CNN: You spend all this time in bars around the world ... your crew must be tempted to drink. Lamprey: Tempted to drink? Fact: I cannot keep up with my crew. CNN: So your camera operator has shot you drunk? Lamprey: I would say yes. CNN: That explains why sometimes you look blurry. Lamprey: I'm generally a very blurry-looking person.",0.51302785,7566
113,"(The Frisky) -- About a year ago, a group of my closest friends got together in a basement apartment in Queens. It was a Saturday night in the dead of winter, and most of us were broke (the economy was crashing) and lazy (we didn't feel like trekking to a bar in the city). As we cracked open a bottle of wine and ate fresh-baked zucchini muffins, one of my friends decided to play us some records on the record player he had recently inherited from his parents. It turned out to be one of the best nights of our lives. In sharing great music, great food and great fun, a tradition was born: Record Party. The New York Times is finally catching on to something my friends and I discovered that night; vinyl is back in a major way. The stats say that CDs are becoming just about as obsolete as cassettes and 8-tracks. Sure, iPods are fun if you're on the go, but really the only way to devour your favorite music (other than to hear it live) is to listen to it on vinyl. It's like hearing the music again for the first time -- rich and layered. Mike Jbara, a bigwig at Warner Music Group, said, ""It is absolutely easy to say vinyl doesn't make sense when you look at convenience, portability, all those things. But all the really great stuff in our lives comes from a root of passion or love."" [New York Times] . That's what Record Party is really all about. But don't take my word for it. Here are five tips for throwing your own rocking Record Party. • Yes, you need a record player. I know you're thinking, ""Where on earth do I get a record player? The antique shop?"" Try eBay or Craigslist. There are so many used record players that need a good home. From bottom of the line models to high-end turntables, you wouldn't believe how many people have record players. If you're an electronics idiot like me, you may want to consult a knowledgeable person. I always ask my super-geeky musician friends about makes, models and features. If you don't have a music nerd in your life, do a little research online or find a specialty store in your area. Also, don't forget to get some great speakers so you can hear all the natural flava of your records. • Starting a record collection isn't as hard or as expensive as you think. It's always fun to go to a local record store and pick out some delicious vinyl. Many record stores have used records, which can save you some money. Take the record out and make sure that it's the right record -- one time I got ""A Chorus Line"" record in a ""Stevie Nicks"" jacket. Also, make sure that the record is not terribly scratched. If you're a bargain hunter like me, go to your local thrift store and pick through. You may have to search for a while, but it's not uncommon to find some $1 gems. Also, flea markets are a great place to find some hot, cheap vinyl. • Keep the guest list small. The best thing about Record Party is reveling in your favorite music and breaking out your finest dance moves. This is always most fun with close friends who have similar tastes in music. But part of the fun is also learning about new music, so you may want to require guests to bring some records of their own. • Food and drinks are a must. It's hard to throw a great record party without food and beverage. Have everyone contribute. Snacks and drinks will be much appreciated when guests step off the makeshift dance floor. • Establish some rules and traditions. At our Record Party, we've established a couple of rules in order to keep the good times rolling: 1. Everyone must write all requests down on our request list. 2. No more than two songs played at one time per person. After everyone has put in a request, the cycle starts over. 3. Everyone gets one ""Yoinx"" per night. A ""Yoinx"" is when you have a great song that you feel like you need to push to the top of the list. Develop your own rules and traditions to ensure that everyone is able to share in the music.

114,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Actor, author and Parkinson's disease activist Michael J. Fox spoke with CNN's ""Larry King Live"" to be aired Thursday. Michael J. Fox: ""I still travel with my kids, and I'm with them part of the day, every day."" In the interview, Fox, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991, talks about his new book, which he describes as ""a memoir of the last 10 years."" In it, he explores the nature of optimism. He also talked about his family, a new approach to acting and President Obama's lifting of a ban on stem cell research, among other things. Here are some excerpts from the show. Larry King: He's founder of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. He's a best-selling author -- the new book is ""Always Looking Up."" By the way, he has got an ABC special, ""Michael J. Fox: Adventures of an Incurable Optimist."" It airs on May 7. You remain -- is it easy to be an optimist? Michael J. Fox: Well, for me it's second nature. It's just the way I look at life. And it's certainly a challenge now for most people to be optimistic, obviously, with all of the troubles we have and the problems that the country is facing. But I think it's exactly in those times when our optimism kicks in highest gear. I think -- there's an expression that I like that I always use: ""Don't wish for a lighter load, wish for broader shoulders."" And I think that people are really -- I see a lot of broader shoulders these days, people are really working on the delts, you know? King: What was it like when you were diagnosed? Fox: Well, you know, it's hard to describe it, because I was so young, I was 29 years old. And so Parkinson's is not what you expect to hear. I had a twitch in my pinky and I figured it was some kind of nerve damage or I'd done something probably athletic. ... But then I got this diagnosis, and I thought the guy was kidding. And then it was shock, and then I had a certain amount of fear and I started to react to it in certain ways. I started drinking more heavily as a way of self-medicating it. And it took me -- you know, it's funny, because I sit and talk about ""Always Looking Up"" and being optimistic, and accept the losses and move on or find new gains, but it took me about seven years, I think, to really get to the point where I could tell people about it. ... I was diagnosed in '91, and it wasn't until '98 that I admitted publicly that it was a situation I was facing. King: It is not life-threatening, is it? Fox: No. And I would say you don't die from it, but you -- up to now, you'll definitely die with it if you have it. ... King: Why did you write the book? Fox: The book was -- I wrote the first book because I had to, I think I had to kind of tell that story just for myself, just kind of to acknowledge all of the work that I had done on getting through that journey. And then this book was -- I thought about writing another, and I thought about people responding so positively to the optimism in the first book. And so many people wanted to talk to me about that. So I thought, well, optimism: What is optimism? And so I started to think about it more kind of empirically, writing a book about optimism as a subject, and interviewing researchers about it and talking to people who are optimistic and traveling to places where people are optimistic and all of this stuff. ... So I had to kind of tell it -- I couldn't tell, talk about optimism without -- and separate it from my experience. I had to make it part of my experience. So then, having done that, and written this book, which is really a memoir of the last 10 years, I still have these questions about optimism. So I went to ABC and I said, 'There was a thing I was going to do a book on, but I'd like to do a documentary special on.' And they said, great. And so we've been traveling around, talking to optimists. We went to Bhutan, which is a country in the Himalayas that actually measures its gross national happiness along with its GDP. King: Really?

You've got to feel like a -- it has come true. ...  Watch Fox's talk about the lifting of the ban » . King: When you act, is it hard? Fox: Oh, yes. I don't have any access to the same tool kit that I always had. But it's like anything. It's like, you find new ways of doing things. And in those new ways, you maybe are able to do things you couldn't do before in ways you might not have approached before. And that's my whole kind of philosophy of life is -- in dealing with Parkinson's or any kind of setback or loss, is that if you avoid it or it creates a hole that you try to fill up with other stuff, with your ego and your needs and your wants and your control issues, then you're just going to dig deeper in a hole. But if you just recognize, 'look, it is what it is' -- now what's around it? I mean, the only thing that I don't have a choice about is whether I have Parkinson's. Everything else I have a choice about. ... Fox explains how he handles the bad days » . King: Parts of your book are a love letter to your wife, Tracy. Without being saccharine, how important has she been? Fox: I couldn't have made the journey that I've made without her. And certainly I wouldn't have this family that I have. And three-quarters of our children were born after the diagnosis. And we knew what we were facing, what we were dealing with, and had some sense of what the prospects were, although they've turned out a lot better than we could have imagined. I mean, I'm 20 years after diagnosis, and there's very little that I don't do now that I used to do. I still travel with my kids, and I'm with them part of the day, every day. King: How old are they now? Fox: My oldest is 19 -- he'll be 20 next month. And the twins are going into high school next year; they are 14. And then I have a 7-year-old.",0.5069939,4488
115,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Pop singer Ricky Martin declared publicly this week what he avoided discussing for years: He is gay. ""I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man,"" Martin wrote on his official Web site. ""I am very blessed to be who I am."" A decade ago, when ABC's Barbara Walters pressed Martin to address rumors about his sexuality, he declined to confirm or deny them. ""I just don't feel like it,"" Martin said. Now, Martin wrote, ""these years in silence and reflection made me stronger and reminded me that acceptance has to come from within and that this kind of truth gives me the power to conquer emotions I didn't even know existed."" The 39-year-old Puerto Rican native started off with the Latin boy band Menudo before launching his solo career in 1991. His song ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" rose to the top of the music charts in 1999 and propelled Martin to stardom. Martin said he decided years ago to not share ""my entire truth"" with the world because people he loved warned him that ""everything you've built will collapse."" ""Allowing myself to be seduced by fear and insecurity became a self-fulfilling prophecy of sabotage,"" he wrote. ""Today I take full responsibility for my decisions and my actions."" The decision to come out was initiated a few months ago, when he began writing his memoirs, he said. ""I got very close to my truth,"" he wrote. ""From the moment I wrote the first phrase I was sure the book was the tool that was going to help me free myself from things I was carrying within me for a long time,"" he wrote. ""Things that were too heavy for me to keep inside."" Martin said that disclosing his secret is important because of his two sons, born via surrogate. ""To keep living as I did up until today would be to indirectly diminish the glow that my kids were born with,"" he wrote. ""Enough is enough. This has to change. This was not supposed to happen five or 10 years ago, it is supposed to happen now. Today is my day, this is my time, and this is my moment."" Writing the seven paragraphs, he said, ""is a solid step towards my inner peace and vital part of my evolution."" ""What will happen from now on? It doesn't matter. I can only focus on what's happening to me in this moment.""",0.50131893,9445
116,"(CNN) -- Stringer is dead. Omar is dead. And soon, ""The Wire"" will be, too. Sonja Sohn, Wendell Pierce and Dominic West discuss matters on the ""Wire"" finale. The show, broadcast by HBO, which -- like CNN -- is a division of Time Warner, created complex storylines weaving together the lives of Baltimore's cops, drug dealers, politicians, port workers, schoolchildren and educators and now journalists. It also created a devoted fan base, including CNN staffers Jo Parker, who coincidentally worked at The Baltimore Sun for 13 years, and Rachel Clarke. Both are veteran watchers of previous seasons who have lapped up this year's story, where events on the street and inside the murder squad become ever more entwined with politics and news, complicating everything they touch. Here, they talk about whether the keenly awaited finale matched expectations. Clarke: Were you satisfied? Parker: No. I expected ""The Wire"" to startle me and make me think right up until the series finale, but in the end it felt too networky. Yes, the storylines were completed and there was a resolution of sorts for each major character, but it all seemed to be too neatly tied ... red ribbon, anyone?  Gallery: Get to know the characters of ""The Wire"" » . Clarke: Yes, I'm all for schmaltz, but that's not why I watched ""The Wire."" In previous seasons, the show has had me sobbing (Bodie's killing), screaming blue murder (Bubbles' suicide attempt) and spiraling downward as I awaited the really bad things that had to happen (the parting of the ways between Stringer and Avon was never going to go well). This time, I had the familiar sinking feeling about some characters and plot lines as they played out, but this time, the writing didn't have the same killer instinct. Or maybe ""The Wire"" has just given me a really dark view of the world, of Baltimore, of humanity, and I should lighten up. Parker: I did experience one shocker during the finale involving a longer-term character. I'm surprised now that I didn't see it coming any more than the character did! Clarke: I know what you're talking about. Sure, there was a moment where I gasped. And there were other vintage ""Wire"" themes and moments. The questions over a moral code, how it's rarely if ever black and white and how real life and real people are just too complicated to fall into that simple ""good or bad"" template. ""Good"" people do bad things and ""bad"" people do good things. And circumstances and the bigger picture will often intervene to steer even the best from the path of the angels. But that's where this season as a whole hasn't matched the other four. The newspaper characters were simply good or evil. But you worked at The Baltimore Sun, so maybe that's true to life?! Parker: There were definitely some folks I'd consider good or evil at The Sun, but none who flat-out grew horns like Templeton, Whiting and Klebanow. (OK, maybe the Templetonesque dude.) I worked there for 13 years and left during ""The Wire's"" run. So I know creator David Simon peripherally and some of the situations he alludes to this season fairly well. I expected this season to be even more compelling to me, if that was possible. Instead, I found the new characters too one-dimensional. I didn't emotionally bond with any of them -- even though some bore the names of my real former colleagues -- so I really didn't care what happened to any of them in the finale. Clarke: Me too, but then I'm still mourning Stringer from season three when good and evil were mixed so well and you could happily cry over the comeuppance of a calculating, cold, murderous drug dealer. There are a lot of old memories from earlier seasons in the finale, but that just made me nostalgic for the earlier stuff. Parker: No, no! Don't talk about ""nostalgia""! That word is ruined for me now! Clarke: For all the delight I got at various lines and shots, I thought some of the last episode was just trying to be too clever. Still, I'll be watching the finale all over again on Sunday. Will you? Parker: I wanted different endings for some characters, but I'm not the one cashing HBO's check. Despite my quibbles at the last season and the finale, I'll be watching it again and mourning its passing. It was a complete treat. Although I'm still ticked off. Clarke: True that.

117,"(CNN) -- Debbie Phelps, the mother of swimming star Michael Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals in Beijing, is the author of a new memoir, ""A Mother For All Seasons."" Debbie Phelps, mother of Olympian Michael Phelps, tells Larry King her son has strong values. Phelps spoke with CNN's Larry King about her new book, a recent tabloid report detailing her son's partying ways and the infamous bong photo. The following is an edited version of the transcript. Larry King: You have this terrific new book coming. If I do say so myself, it's inspiring. Yet (Thursday's) lead story in the ""New York Daily News"" gate crasher column -- I don't know who writes that -- ""tsk, tsk,"" it says, ""Michael Phelps, partying your face off in public is not the way to reclaim your good guy image. The Olympian was been laying relatively low since his bong smoking scandal in January was out in full force Tuesday night at New York City hot spot Marquis"" -- I think is the name -- ""Michael was definitely having a good time, an eyewitness tells us, drinking straight from a bottle of Grey Goose. When the DJ started playing MIA's 'Paper Planes,' he got up started dancing like a loon and kept on yelling 'shots.' Phelps definitely had enough alcohol on hand for several four round. He ordered four bottles of Vodka."" Is this tough for a mother? How do you react? Debbie Phelps: It's one thing that I learn at a very early age is I don't get caught up in gossip columns. I know my son. He has great values, lots of integrity. That's what I think about that. King: Did you talk to him about this? Phelps: I always talk to Michael. I talk to Michael every day. We talked about training today and things of that nature. King: But it would be normal to say, what happened, wouldn't it? I would say that to my son. Phelps: We give support. We give guidance. We give an ear to listen. And, again, I don't get caught up in gossip. King: Therefore, you don't believe it? I just want to establish what your feelings are. Phelps: I don't get caught up in gossip, Mr. King. King: What about something that wasn't gossip, the picture with the bong thing. It was a picture. Phelps: It's a picture, that's true. But, you know, a picture can say many things. It has many words. It has many meanings. It has many visualizations that you want to think. It depends on the person who is looking at that picture. You know, as a mom, I support all three of my children. I believe that no matter who you are in this country, in this world, there are obstacles that get into your life. I call them speed bumps in school sometimes. I heard someone say lightning bolts. That's another term for that. But, you know, how do we grow? How do we learn? You raise a child through 18. You send them off to college. You give them the roots. You give them the foundation to be a strong, young man, a strong lady. Life throws curve balls to you sometimes. How do you handle that curve ball? King: Michael is 23. That's an adult. He's an adult. Phelps: A young adult. King: Young adult. So one could say it's his life. He chooses to lead it. As our parent, we do our best to guide them, but 23 is 23. Do you view him still as a kid? Phelps: I view my 31-year-old daughter as a kid sometimes. You know, I look at each of my children independently and individually of themselves. They have many strong values, strong points, professionalism. I'm just very proud of all three of them and everything they've done. King: Do you think these kind of stories -- and you don't pay attention to them -- hurt your book? Phelps: I was asked many times and told many times, ""Debbie, you need to write a book some day."" As an educator, I'm thinking, I would really like to do that. It became a personal goal of mine to be able to publish a book, not knowing exactly what it was going to be. Was it going to be my life? Was it going to be parenting? Was it going to be swimming? Was it just going to be motivational and inspirational? When I take a look at the book I was able to write, I have great pride in that book because it shows other people, every woman, but not even women -- men can read this book also -- the inspiration and motivation of life. King: The question is, ""Do you think these kind of stories might hurt the chance of people buying the book, which is what you want?"" Phelps: People are going to have to make that decision. King: Do you think it might? Phelps: Life is life. I do want to say, though, in reference to the Beijing Olympics, we, as a family, I think, made a great impression on the world, on the United States. My son has great love for me. It's a great bonding relationship. Families are very important. King: Is he still a role model, do you think? Phelps: You know, when I think of the word role model, I'll go back to me being a little girl. It was my mom and my dad. They were my role models when I was growing up. When I hear that role model in a sentence with my son, what I think about with Michael is what he does with and for children. It might be things people don't even know of -- his association with the Boys and Girls Club. For years, he has done that (and) his association with Make A Wish. He touches kids' lives. So if an individual, wherever they may be, may select my son as a role model, I say that my son has strong values. I say he's a human being. And I say that from obstacles that get in people's ways -- we all have them, Mr. King, and you know that -- what do you learn from them and how do you rise above the occasion?",0.49042404,3048
118,"(CNN) -- Every time her cell phone rings, Christy Harness thinks of her husband. More consumers download ringtones to their cell phones than  full-length songs. The 34-year-old native of Jackson County, Georgia, set her ringtone to Sugarland's ""All I Wanna Do,"" a song that, she says, perfectly expresses the way she feels about him. ""I kind of put myself in [the singer's] place because ... she's in love with this guy. If he's not around, she misses him. Basically, I think the song relates to me and [my husband] and our relationship,"" Harness said. These days, ringtones do much more than alert mobile phone users of a call. Ringtones seem to have become vital fashion statements, a way for people to showcase their personalities and even their feelings about who is calling. According to a 2008 study by Ipsos MediaCT, a marketing research company, approximately one-third of mobile phone users download ringtones, and about 40 percent of users change their ringtones frequently. Ipsos research shows that ringtones are the most common type of mobile music content downloaded by users, compared to full-length songs and ringback tones, tones that replace the typical ringing signal heard by the caller. ""I find regular ringtones kind of dull, so I wanted something exciting,"" said Gordy King, a 51-year-old from Salt Lake City, Utah. King said he gets a kick out of annoying his mostly Republican co-workers with his Barack Obama ringtones, even playing them over the intercom at the electrical supply warehouse where he works. ""It's fake news people saying 'Barack Obama has won the election,' "" he said. ""I really like Barack Obama. I think [my ringtone] probably says that I'm nonconventional and it says I lean a little more liberal. I don't know anyone else who has that ringtone."" Using a ringtone creator application on Facebook, King said he also makes his own ringtones by downloading sound files onto his computer and editing them to be shorter and louder or softer. Donald Kaplan found a perfect fit with his ringtone choice. Kaplan, of New York, changed his ringtones often before finally settling on the theme song from ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" ""I'm thinking of sticking with it. I notice that when people hear my phone ring they get amused ... I think that people really connect with that movie,"" Kaplan said. But that's not always the case. Kaplan said one of his co-workers wasn't exactly pleased with the ringtone. The co-worker sent a mass e-mail to the office, telling everyone to keep their cell phones on silent. ""The ringtone drove him crazy and he tried to be tactful but I knew that [the e-mail] was directed specifically to me,"" Kaplan said. ""I could tell that this particular ringtone just drove him up the wall ... just the repetition of the sound."" For some, one ringtone simply isn't enough. Many mobile phone users set specific tones to specific people so that the tones act as audible caller IDs. ""I group people,"" said Natasha Khan, a 26-year-old from McLean, Virginia. ""I group all my best girlfriends together, the people I don't want to talk to together, work contacts together, and family together."" Khan said when her best friends call she hears ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,"" by Cyndi Lauper, and when she gets a call from people she doesn't particularly like, her phone rings ""Bugaboo"" by Destiny's Child. ""Bugaboo,"" about a woman irritated by a male caller, contains such lines as, ""It's not hot that you be callin' me."" ""The 'Bugaboo' ringtone has gotten me in trouble,"" Khan said with a laugh. ""This guy -- I forgot that he was on that list and I told him I needed his number and he said, 'Oh, I'll call you' and he realized he was on the list."" Customizing a phone with multiple ringtones can be expensive. Depending on the wireless carrier or the service plan, ringtones cost anywhere from $0.99 to $2.99. That may not deter cell phone users. Analysts at Screen Digest, a UK-based firm covering global media markets, predicted that mobile music sales will double from $1.6 billion in 2008 to $3.2 billion in 2012. But there are also free ways to get ringtones, like the ringtone creator application on Facebook -- one of several ringtone applications on the social-networking Web site -- that make setting ringtones all the more appealing. ""The ringtone creator was fun,"" said King. ""No matter how big or little the song or sound effect ... you could select a snippet and edit it."" Many mobile phone users like to be creative and have fun with their ringtones, and their ringtone choice can reveal much about their personalities. Khan's default ringtone, she said, is typically an upbeat dance song like her current one, ""Forever"" by Chris Brown. ""I think the day can be so mundane and work can bog you down, so I like any chance I can get to get some joy,"" Khan said. ""It's just a break in the day to feel good randomly.""",0.4672763,2154
120,"(CNN) -- The blog ""Stuff White People Like"" is wildly popular with fans who've embraced the hilarious, satirical sendup of the white middle class that -- according to the list -- have an ongoing love affair with things such as coffee (No. 1), organic food (No. 6), yoga (15) and the Toyota Prius (60). Blogger-turned-author Christian Lander is the force behind ""Stuff White People Like."" The site also has spurred an outpouring from those who view it as offensive and racist. Now devotees and detractors alike have more to discuss with the release of the book ""Stuff White People Like: A Definitive Guide to the Unique Taste of Millions"" by the blog's creator, Christian Lander. Filled with photos and some content from the blog, the guide includes new entries exclusive to the book. Lander also worked with a designer to create things such as flow charts on ""How to Name a White Child"" and ""White Career Trajectories"" as well as a test of the reader's ""whiteness."" As befitting the genius behind such a site and book, Lander is a bit of a ham (actually, make that Canadian bacon since he hails from Toronto, Ontario).  Watch Lander talk about what he likes » . The origins of ""Stuff"" date from January 2008, he said, because of an instant messenger conversation between him and his friend Miles about the HBO drama ""The Wire."" Miles, who is Filipino, tossed off that he didn't trust any white person who didn't watch the series. That exchange started a back-and-forth between the two about what white people were doing instead of watching the show. ""We said, 'Oh, they are going to plays, they're doing yoga, they're getting divorced,' "" recalled Lander, who couldn't pass up the gold mine of ideas and started blogging. ""The goal was to literally make Miles and a few of my friends laugh, and it just took off."" Within six weeks, Random House came calling, and a book deal was finalized. CNN talked to the blogger-turned-author about his ""whiteness,"" whether he is like Stephen Colbert but instead mocks earnest, left-wing types, and why ""Stuff White People Like"" will never make the list of ""Stuff White People Like."" CNN: Where do you get your ideas? Christian Lander: Farmers' markets. CNN: How do you get your ideas at farmers' markets? Lander: Keeping my eyes open. I just see what people are up to. And the mirror is another good place to look for inspiration. I really make fun of myself. CNN: So what makes you an authority on white people? Lander: Look at me [laughing]. I mean, I have liberal arts degrees; I look like this. I'm on the inside. CNN: Do you ever worry about offending people? Lander: No. I'm glad when I offend people with this because it's not offensive. What's been great about it is the title draws people in, and right away they are like, ""What is this? Am I going to get offended by this?"" Then they read it, and it's not what they expect. People see the title and they expect ""Stuff White People Like"" to be entries like mayonnaise, or dancing poorly, these old stereotypes that are really outdated and aren't even funny anymore. You're sort of expecting it to be the lame white guy stuff and you go, ""Oh my God, this is all the stuff I actually like."" It's playing off white stereotypes, but it's not stereotypes in a demeaning way. CNN: If those are old stereotypes, could your stuff be considered ""new stereotypes""? Lander: No, because they're true [laughing]. I consider these valid observations. It's an update on this idea of a yuppie. In the '80s, the idea of the yuppie was really about just consumerism: I have an expensive BMW, I have these things, and it's buying, buying, buying. I think that that attitude is still there, but the materials changed into where it's ""My carbon footprint's lower, my music taste is better, I visited more countries than you."" The quest for status is still there. CNN: What are some of the entries that elicited the most negative responses and really pushed people's buttons? Lander: One was written by Miles. Now Miles is Asian, and I can't stress that enough. He wrote post No. 11, which is ""White People Like Asian Girls."" That has been by far the most commented on. The other ones have all been pretty level in terms of drawing responses from people. CNN: What are some of the things that have been rejected from the list? Lander: People send in stuff all the time, and one of the things is that people just don't get what I am going for here. They send in [suggestions such as] guns, NASCAR, trailer parks -- these old stereotypes that are not what I'm after. The one I reject a lot is people say, ""Well, you know what, 'Stuff White People Like' should be on the list of 'Stuff White People Like.' "" I'm just like, ""All right, postmodern hero, you're not the first person to send this in. I'm not putting it on the list."" CNN: Entry No. 92 is book deals, so we are assuming you like that one. What are some other things on the list you like? Lander: There are things that I like that I am ashamed that I like. My favorite entry, which I wrote and where I attack myself the most, is ""Knowing What's Best for Poor People."" That was one that definitely applies to me, and I sort of recognize the ego that's behind that one and how ridiculous that one is. CNN: What's some stuff white people don't like? Lander: Other white people. That's it. The wrong kind of white people. CNN: Who are the wrong kind of white people? Lander: Anyone you blame for everything that's wrong in America are the wrong kind of white people. Not only do they hate them because they create all of these problems, but if those kinds of people start liking anything on this list, they immediately become unacceptable. CNN: Stephen Colbert made the list, and he's renowned for making fun of the right wing. Do you consider yourself a type of Stephen Colbert for the lefties? Lander: I don't know because Stephen Colbert, in his heart of hearts, is a lefty and so am I. I consider myself a self-aware, left-wing person who's not afraid to recognize the selfishness and contradictions that come on the left. I think a lot of people who are on that side really fail to do that a lot of the time. I think the people I write about here are very, very self-righteous and believe that everything they do is right, and they are very resistant to cast a critical eye to themselves. It was really fun for me to write in a cathartic way, sort of like I am attacking my own pretentiousness and my own ridiculousness. It's just amazing because these people are so self-aware but so unaware at the same time.",0.46581194,2336
121,"London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victoria's Secret supermodel-turned-philanthropist. Despite her riches, Nemcova, who grew up with few luxuries in communist Czechoslovakia, told CNN that her most important work is her charity, the Happy Hearts Fund. The model set up the foundation after her near-death experience in the 2004 Asian tsunami. While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not. Here, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the ""Golden City,"" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks. CNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague. Petra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was ""wow."" I was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience. The following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent. CNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words? Petra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the ""golden city,"" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush. I think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty. In five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful. CNN: What was your childhood like? Petra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless. We didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature. And the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood. But it was harder for my parents. Because if you weren't part of the system then you didn't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you. My parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you didn't get enough stamps throughout the year, you would get in trouble. CNN: What happened to you in the 2004 tsunami? Petra Nemcova: I lost my partner and physically, my pelvis was broken four times, I was drowning many times throughout the experience. There were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones. Seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers, there was just a lot of love around in that moment. That's what happens actually if you live through disasters, it brings people together, it shows that we are capable of that compassion, but unfortunately it just goes away after some time. CNN: Tell us about your foundation, Happy Hearts? Petra Nemcova: Happy Hearts is a foundation that I established after the tsunami. It helps children improve their lives after natural disasters through educational and sustainable initiatives. We build or rebuild a school, add computer labs inside and then we build businesses to sustain the school. The education is really a key not just for the children to recover faster from the disaster but also to help them, their families and communities get out of poverty. We help over 23,000 children a year. We give them hope and not just for them but for their parents and communities. The schools elevate the whole community. After the tsunami we went to other countries where disasters happened and one of them was in Indonesia. We work with local partners on the ground and have been able to build 33 kindergartens after the 2005 earthquake and that's something incredible because it really changed so many lives. Our other project is in Peru, where there was an earthquake in 2007 and we have a commitment to build three schools a year. CNN: If you only had 24 hours in Prague, what would you do? Petra Nemcova: First of all I would take my friends and family and I would walk around and go to the Charles Bridge because that is my favorite place. Then I would stop by some exhibitions of some new artist. And then I would go and sit down for some tea perhaps at the Musical House. In the evening I may go to a typical Czech pub and afterwards for a concert because I really love them; they put my mind at ease and inspire me. CNN: How creative is the city? Petra Nemcova: Many people know about Kafka and some of the other famous writers. But there is a lot of interest in music here and in different types of art. That's perhaps because art was suppressed during communist times and you were only allowed to read certain authors. That's why there is such a hunger now for everything that was forbidden. Not just Czech authors but also a lot of American authors because especially anything from U.S. was big taboo and you could not see any movies and you could not listen to any music. I discovered Stevie Wonder seven years ago and I'm still working on learning and seeing more of the great movies. CNN: If Prague were a person, who would it be? Petra Nemcova: I think Prague would be our former president Vaclav Havel. He is a proud person and Prague is a proud city; he's an artist and Prague is artistic; he's an achiever and Prague has achieved so much.

Kate Moore, 15, of Des Moines, Iowa, out-texted more than 250,000 participants for the texting title in New York. Over 250,000 participants of all ages entered the competition, whose championship rounds were held in New York on Monday and Tuesday and won by Kate Moore of Des Moines, Iowa.   Some challenges were straightforward tests of speed and accuracy, but others required a little extra texting savvy. In one round, texters had to send texts while blindfolded. Another round quizzed contestants' knowledge of texting acronyms. The only acronym to stump every texter was PAW -- parents are watching. The fourth-place finisher, 21-year-old Jordan Rowe, saw her dreams of texting glory vanish in the ""pressure cooker"" round, where actors dressed as emoticons attempted to distract contestants tasked with texting tongue-twisters. Rowe failed to accurately text ""Which wicked witch wished which more wicked witch in the well?"" while a human emoticon talked trash about her sister. Riffing off texters' sometimes dangerous tendency to text while performing other tasks, another round required contestants to complete an obstacle course while firing off difficult-to-type texts. ""I felt like I was gonna die,"" the eventual champion said of the texting gauntlet, getting a big LOL from the audience. The finals on Tuesday afternoon pitted Dynda Morgan, 14, of Savannah, Georgia, against Moore. The two went head to head in a best-of-three showdown to see who could most quickly pound out lengthy texts predetermined by the judges -- with no errors. Morgan, whose stepsister also made it to the championships, took the first round. Faced with a do-or-die situation in the second round, Moore seemed to bet on accuracy over speed, finishing well behind her opponent but winning the round. In the tiebreaker, the two girls furiously raced to thumb the final text: ""Zippity Dooo Dahh Zippity Ayy...MY oh MY, what a wonderful day! Plenty of sunshine Comin' my way....Zippitty Do Dah Zippity Aay! WondeRful Feeling Wonderful day!"" The pregnant pause before the winner was announced stretched into a seeming eternity because Moore apparently forgot to hit send after finishing her text. But then Moore's phone began to vibrate, signaling that she was the grand champion. Kate's beaming mother, Claire, acknowledged that she has confiscated her daughter's phone on occasion, but said she appreciates that her daughter's texting habit means she's in constant touch. ""I can get ahold of [her] at all times,"" she said. Nor does Moore's mother have to foot an appallingly large phone bill each month, because her daughter is on an unlimited texting plan. She did concede that the texting portion of one of Moore's recent phone bills stretched to 294 pages. Moore's victory was all the more awe-inspiring because she got a phone with text capability less than a year ago. Moments after her victory, Moore agreed to an exclusive text message interview with CNN. CNN: OMG U r ltrlly the wrld's bst txter. How does it feel? Moore: It feels the best!
