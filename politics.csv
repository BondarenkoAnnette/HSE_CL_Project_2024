John McCain, a hero at a bipartisan dinner Monday night and encouraged politicians to reach across the aisle. President-elect Barack Obama greets Sen. John McCain on stage after praising him at a bipartisan dinner. ""I could stand here and recite the long list of John's bipartisan accomplishments ..."" Obama said. ""Campaign finance reform. Immigration. The Patients' Bill of Rights. All those times he has crossed the aisle and risked the ire of his party for the good of his country. And yet, what makes John such a rare and courageous public servant is not the accomplishments themselves, but the true motivation behind them."" McCain returned the gracious feelings at the dinner. ""I am very grateful to the president-elect and to all of you for this very considerate gesture, and for allowing me to play a small role in the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States, even if it isn't the one I had in mind a few months ago,"" McCain said. ""Tomorrow, the President-elect will accept the burdensome privilege of leading America to its next accomplishments and its future greatness,"" McCain went on to say. ""He has my sincere best wishes for his success, and my promise of assistance. For his success will be our success."" After praising McCain, Obama urged everyone to take the bipartisan dinner past ""just an inaugural tradition"" and turn it into a ""new way of doing the people's business in this city."" ""We will not always agree on everything in the months to come, and we will have our share of arguments and debates,"" Obama said. ""But let us strive always to find that common ground, and to defend together those common ideals, for it is the only way we can meet the very big and very serious challenges that we face right now."" On the eve of his inauguration, the president-elect even made time for a joke. ""I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Sen. John McCain,"" Obama said as he opened his speech. ""And then, according to the rules agreed to by both parties, John will have approximately 30 seconds to make a rebuttal."" Obama's speech at the bipartisan dinner capped a day filled by appearances, including visiting wounded soldiers and exhorting Americans to spend more time in the service of others. In Washington people took in the sights of pre-inauguration activities and concerts. ""The energy on the streets is something I've never seen before,"" said Nancy Wigal, who lives in Vernon Square. ""People are walking lighter, standing taller and are reaching out to one another. It feels like hope. It feels like shared happiness."" Wigal said Obama's inauguration has given residents hope that change actually will happen. ""It's all because of Obama -- we dare to feel positive that we may have actually elected a leader, not just a politician,"" she said. ""There are impromptu progressive dinner parties, cookouts and house parties. We finally feel like a real change has come to town."" Obama began his day with a surprise visit to wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He met with 14 patients injured in either Iraq or Afghanistan.

The shelter provides a variety of services, including counseling, job training, and substance abuse prevention assistance, for up to 15 teenagers at a time. Roughly 30 teenagers are spending the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday volunteering at the shelter by helping to renovate a dorm room. Obama rolled up his sleeves and pitched in during the visit, using a roller to help paint a couple of walls and a piece of furniture. He also quoted King to the teenagers, noting that ""everybody can be great [because] everybody can serve."" ""Don't underestimate the power of people who join together to accomplish amazing things,"" Obama added. Given the crisis America is currently in, ""we can't allow any idle hands. Everybody's got to pitch in."" Wigal said Obama's actions and words make her believe the president-elect has the skills needed to help the country move forward. ""Those of us who live and work here, who try to create, shape, influence and move policy forward, are feeling as if we can finally do something that'll result in forward motion,"" Wigal said. ""We believe we have a leader who listens to those who work the issues every day and know the real solutions."" For Wigal, that's exactly what makes Inauguration Day so important. ""Tomorrow is going to be the biggest day in our country's history since its creation,"" she said. During Monday's activities Obama also cited the heroics of U.S. Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger, who safely landed a crippled commercial airliner in the Hudson River last Thursday, saving the lives of all 155 people on board. ""If everybody did their job as well as he did [his] job, we would be in pretty good shape,"" Obama said. Obama has personally invited Sullenberger to the inauguration. Obama later joined Vice President-elect Joe Biden at a high school where students were making blankets and greeting cards, among other things, for soldiers overseas. Speaking to the students, Obama again invoked King's memory, noting the slain civil rights leader had ""dedicated his life to working at the grassroots level ... on behalf of justice and equality."" ""I am making a commitment to you, as your next president, that we are going to make government work,"" Obama said. But, he warned, ""government can only do so much. If we're just waiting around for someone else to do it for us ... it never gets done. We're going to have to take responsibility, all of us."" Incoming first lady Michelle Obama, joined by Jill Biden, the wife of the vice president-elect, spent the morning at a separate volunteer service event at RFK Stadium, where people were assembling care packages for soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

3,"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama, President Bush and all of the surviving past presidents got together Wednesday for a historic meeting at the White House. Barack Obama meets with President Bush and past presidents in the Oval Office on Wednesday. ""One message that I have, and I think we all share, is that we want you to succeed. Whether we're Democrat or Republican, we care deeply about this country,"" Bush told Obama before lunch with the former presidents. Bush and Obama were joined by Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Obama thanked the president for hosting them and said he was grateful for the opportunity to get ""advice, good counsel and fellowship"" from the group.  Watch what Obama says about the meeting » . Obama's press secretary said the presidents had a ""very constructive conversation"" and Obama appreciated ""the spirit of bipartisanship they showed"" in wishing him success. ""The president and the former presidents had helpful advice on managing the office, as well as thoughts on the critical issues facing the country right now. The president-elect is anxious to stay in touch with all of them in the coming years,""  Robert Gibbs said. Presidential historian Doug Brinkley said it's ""very smart politics for Obama to keep a channel open"" with the former presidents. ""If he has a policy initiative that he wants to lead the country behind ... if he could get the signatures, the green light from all of the ex-presidents to say, 'Not only am I for this, but I have all of the ex-presidents backing me' -- that's powerful,"" he said. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the last time all of the living presidents got together at the White House was in 1981, and she called Wednesday's meeting a ""historic moment."" She said the president was ""delighted"" to host the luncheon. ""Each of them expressed their desire for President-elect Obama to have a very successful presidency. During the lunch, they had a wide-ranging discussion on many different issues facing the United States, and they all look forward to remaining in contact in the future,""  Perino said. The meeting marked the second time Bush has hosted Obama since the election. Obama suggested the meeting with all of the former presidents when he and Bush first met in November. Perino said earlier she didn't know what they would talk about, but she said she'd love to be able to hear it. ""I'm sure all of us would love to be flies on the wall and listening to that conversation,"" Perino said during Tuesday's daily news briefing. Perino speculated that they would discuss what it's like to raise children in the White House and how to protect them. Brinkley predicted that first and foremost, the presidents would recall what it was like to be president. ""All of them will have little anecdotes. They'll see something in the White House that will bring back a memory. They'll try to bring some levity to this -- make it a very special and engaging and actually a fun afternoon for Barack Obama,"" he said. Secondly, Brinkley said, the conversation would probably turn to what's going on in the Middle East. Brinkley said that all of the men will be on their ""best behavior,"" but, given the personalities at the luncheon, there could be some tension. ""The friction, if there is any, is between Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, who are known to not like each other at all,"" he said, pointing out that the Clinton team did not like Carter ""parachuting for peace into Bosnia, North Korea and Haiti"" during Clinton's administration. ""That's the relationship that is not warm, it's not good, and if you are a body language expert, you might home in on that,"" he said. President Bush may find himself the odd man out at the meeting, at least in terms of popularity. Bush registered only a 27 percent approval rating in a December CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey. In contrast, Obama had an 82 percent approval rating. A new poll out Wednesday indicates that 69 percent of adult Americans approved of how Clinton handled his job as president, while 64 percent of adult Americans gave a thumbs up to Carter and 60 percent approved of George H.W. Bush. CNN's Lauren Kornreich contributed to this report .",0.82192296,3411

10,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Inauguration revelry began Sunday afternoon as thousands of people packed the National Mall in Washington for a free concert featuring big stars. Thousands gather Sunday afternoon on the National Mall in Washington. President-elect Barack Obama addressed a roaring crowd after 90 minutes of high-energy acts such as U2, Mary J. Blige, Usher and Beyonce. ""Welcome to this celebration of American renewal,"" he said. ""In the course of our history, only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now."" ""I stand here today as hopeful as ever that the United States of America will endure,"" Obama said. ""That it will prevail; that the dream of our founders will live on in our time.""  Watch Obama address the crowd » . Obama spent the morning visiting Arlington National Cemetery and attending church before heading to the ""We are One: Opening Inaugural Celebration"" at the Lincoln Memorial. It was nothing but good vibes -- a brief respite for an incoming president who will face huge problems after he takes office Tuesday. Bruce Springsteen opened the concert with his song ""The Rising,"" singing, ""How far I've gone/How high I've climbed/On my back's a 60 pound stone/On my shoulder a half mile line."" Along the National Mall, between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, people watched the concert on massive screens and sang along with ""America the Beautiful"" and ""This Land is Your Land."" During U2's performance of ""Pride (In the Name of Love),"" a tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., frontman Bono referenced the civil rights leader's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, saying that it was also, ""an Irish dream, a European dream, and African dream, an Israeli dream, and a Palestinian dream.""   Watch performances from the concert » . Obama mentioned the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, and also referred to King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, which took place in the same spot where he was standing. ""Directly in front of us is a pool that still reflects the dream of a King and the glory of a people who marched and bled so that their children might be judged by their character's content,"" he said. Obama said what gives him ""the greatest hope of all is not the stone and marble that surrounds us, but what fills the spaces in between. It is you -- Americans of every race and region and station who came here because you believe in what this country can be and because you want to help us get there."" Vice President-elect Joe Biden also spoke, pointing to those ""marble domes"" and towers of Washington surrounding the crowd which represent the ""majesty of a great nation -- all built stone by stone by American men and women.""

11,"(CNN)  -- The cool of Barack Obama was very much on display on a warm day in Boston's Christopher Columbus Park during the summer of 2004. John Kerry, right, and Obama confer at the 2004 DNC, where Obama wowed the crowd with his keynote address. It was going to be a big day for the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate from Illinois. In a few hours, on that night, July 27, 2004, he was to give the keynote address to the Democratic National Convention at the Fleet Center about a mile away. But as he gave a lunchtime speech on environmental policy to a leisurely crowd of about 100 people at the green space on Boston Harbor, he was relaxed and loose, seemingly unconcerned about what was ahead. Taking notes amid the crowd, I hoped to get a few minutes with the candidate. I'd been told about his vaunted charisma -- my two brothers, both of whom live in Chicago, had mentioned his oratorical gifts -- but in person Obama seemed familiar, even a touch wonky, as he talked about asthma rates and the Bush administration's environmental record. I chatted with Obama's press attaché and with a Chicago Tribune reporter, David Mendell, as the speech wound down, and was offered a ride in a nondescript minivan back to the Fleet Center. Even then Obama was attracting attention; several members of the audience gave him enthusiastic greetings as he left the scene to get in the van. In the front passenger seat of the van, the rail-thin Obama, obviously hungry (he later told me he'd lost eight pounds since the beginning of the campaign), chewed on a sandwich and joked with the other passengers as I peppered him with questions during the 20-minute ride. He answered with deliberate thoughtfulness, though he'd probably heard at least a few of them dozens of times already. Was he worried about the speech, the kind of spotlight that had made political leaders including William Jennings Bryan, Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards national figures? ""There's going to be some adrenaline,"" he said, after taking off his tie and unbuttoning his white dress shirt. ""But the pressure I'm experiencing is nothing compared to folks I'm meeting getting laid off. ... That's real pressure."" And what about the Senate race? Illinois Republicans were in disarray and better-known, better-funded candidates had fallen by the wayside, with Obama seemingly now a sure thing for the seat. ""Three months is a lifetime in politics,"" Obama replied. By now, Obama's rise is well known: the son of a Kenyan father and Kansas mother, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii, community organizer, Harvard Law Review editor, author, law instructor, politician. He's been astutely revealing in his books, notably his 1995 memoir ""Dreams From My Father,"" and his presidential campaign has reflected his demeanor. But none of it was foreordained. In the fall of 2003, when he was still an Illinois state senator, he was one of seven candidates running for Peter Fitzgerald's vacated U.S. Senate seat. One of his opponents was a multimillionaire; another was the Illinois state controller. Obama was unknown and underfunded. ""I remember asking [at one event], 'Where is he?' "" Mendell recalled at the Boston rally. ""And somebody said, 'He's parking the car.' "" Mendell's description of Obama's 2004 race offers echoes of his painstaking, grassroots 2008 campaign. Obama had some good luck: The multimillionaire, Blair Hull, had details of his ugly divorce come out during the campaign. But Obama's success was also a tribute to his meticulous resolve. ""He ran a really smart primary campaign,"" Mendell said. ""He waited until the ninth inning to score all his runs. ... It was masterfully done."" Mendell later wrote a book on Obama, ""Obama: From Promise to Power."" Not even Obama knows for sure how he landed the keynote slot. In his 2006 book, ""The Audacity of Hope,"" he writes, ""The process by which I was selected ... remains something of a mystery to me."" He didn't meet 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry until the Illinois primary was over, he recalls; he spoke at a Kerry fundraiser but didn't know he'd be giving a speech at the DNC until weeks later. Even then, he didn't know he'd deliver the keynote until told by Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill. According to an August article in The New Republic, Obama was selected over some better-known names by the Kerry brain trust, which included Cahill and adviser Robert Shrum, for various reasons. As an African-American, he would help attract minority voters; Obama was also youthful and energetic, qualities that the Kerry campaign wanted to display on television. And he had a good rapport with Kerry, Mendell told the magazine. ""It's Kerry kind of looking at him [at the fundraiser] and picking up tricks from the rookie,"" Mendell said. ""That was the event where he really impressed Kerry."" The keynote, of course, electrified the nation and introduced America to the man who would become president. ""Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us,"" Obama said. ""Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America -- there's the United States of America. ... ""We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America."" He gave a hint of those words in the van on the way to the Fleet Center. He was going to give a unifying message, he said, not one that reinforced the ""slash-and-burn politics"" that had divided the country. ""People know [President] Bush isn't the cause of every problem in the world, and they know the Democrats aren't a bunch of raving lunatics,"" he said. Having finished the sandwich, the van approaching its destination, and prepared to enter the Fleet Center for another round of interviews. When that was over, he was going to take a jog. ""Then a long shower,"" he added, ""and maybe a nap."" History may have awaited, but he wasn't perturbed. Then again, maybe he knew something the rest of us didn't. He'd completed the speech a couple weeks earlier, and he must have suspected its power. In a New Yorker article by Ryan Lizza, Obama's friend Marty Nesbitt also recalls the buzz building around Obama that day, and a clue Obama gave as to what was next. ""My speech,"" Obama said, ""is pretty good.""  Watch another 'pretty good' address: Obama's victory speech » .",0.80574906,1373

Beyoncé sang Etta James' ""At Last,"" from her role in the movie ""Cadillac Records"" as the couple laughed and took their first spin around the dance floor. Before the dance, Obama addressed the crowd, which erupted in applause when he entered the room. ""First of all, how good-looking is my wife?"" Obama joked.  Watch the Obamas at the first ball of the night » . All eyes certainly were on Michelle Obama, who had kept her choice of a designer and dress style a secret until the moment she entered the dance floor. The first lady was clad in a long white gown designed by up-and-coming designer Jason Wu, 26.  The gown made especially for the first lady is made of ivory silk chiffon, embellished with organza and Swarovski crystal rhinestones and silver thread embroidery, according to one of Wu's publicists. Wu told CNN he didn't know that she had chosen his gown until her first ball appearance Tuesday night. ""It's thrilling. ... For a young designer, I couldn't ask for any more than this,"" said Wu, whose design style combines modern lifestyle dressing and haute couture, according to his Web site. He designed and delivered the dress at the request of Michelle Obama's aides in December, according to fashion expert Mary Alice Stephenson, contributing editor at Harper's Bazaar. Wu -- who has been in the business for three years, according to InStyle.com fashion director Joe Berean -- said he intended the gown to stand for everything that she and President Obama are about.  Listen to Berean critique Michelle Obama's inauguration outfits » . ""It's about hope. It's about newness,"" he said. ""It's all a little dreamlike, and we're making history, and I wanted to really reflect that."" The Neighborhood Ball, a first of its kind and one of the balls open to the public, was the first of 10 official balls that the Obamas were scheduled to attend. For the new president, the first was particularly important. ""I cut my teeth doing neighborhood work and this campaign was organized neighborhood by neighborhood,"" he said. For that reason ""this ball is the one that captures best the spirit of this campaign,"" Obama said. The Obamas then moved to their second ball -- the Home State Ball, for Illinois and Hawaii --  at the Convention Center. After greeting the crowd by saying ""Aloha,"" the president thanked many in the crowd who he said were old friends who had been part of the couple's lives for awhile. ""This is a special ball because it represents our roots,"" he said. The couple laughed and embraced as they danced. President Obama even let loose after his long day, twirling his wife around in a circle -- a move the crowd cheered.  Time: See the glamour of past balls . Next, the Obamas made their way to the Commander-in-Chief Ball, attended by many members of the military, including wounded veterans. ""It is wonderful to be surrounded by some of the very best and bravest Americans,"" Obama said. ""Your courage, your grace and your patriotism inspire us all."" Obama told the crowd that there is ""no greater honor or responsibility than serving as your commander in chief.""  Watch the Obamas as the Commander-in-Chief Ball » . Obama then introduced members of the military from Illinois stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan. After thanking them, Obama took time for lighter banter, polling the members of the military about whether they were Chicago Cubs or Chicago White Sox baseball fans. ""Terrible!"" quipped Obama, known to be a huge White Sox fan, as most said they were Cubs fans. Then Obama introduced his wife, who took a moment to emerge from backstage. ""I may have been stood up,"" he joked, before she came out for their next dance. Next, the Obamas turned their attention to the Youth Inaugural Ball, where people between the ages of 18 and 35 gathered. ""When you look at the history of this campaign, what started out as an improbable journey -- when nobody gave us a chance -- was carried forward, was inspired by, was driven by, was energized by, young people all across America,"" Obama said. The president thanked the young people who came out to vote in dramatically high numbers, especially compared to past elections. He said a new generation inspired an older generation, and ""that's how change happens in America."" Afterward, the Obamas moved to the Home State Ball for Delaware and Pennsylvania, honoring Vice President Joe Biden. ""We are grateful to you, not only for the trust you bestowed, but also for a guy named Joe Biden,"" Obama said. Biden was born in Pennsylvania and later moved to Delaware, which he represented in the U.S. Senate. The Obamas then visited the rest of the parties earlier than scheduled and in quick succession, spending about five minutes each at the Mid-Atlantic, Western, Midwest, Southern and Eastern regional balls. At the Western Ball, singer Marc Anthony helped entertain about 11,500 guests, including film director Ron Howard and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" actress Cheryl Hines. When the Obamas arrived, someone shouted ""I love you"" to the president. ""I love you back,"" Obama responded. ""Michelle loves you, too."" Before the couple's dance at the Midwest Ball, the president introduced the first lady by saying he'd ""like to dance with the one who brung me, and who does everything I do except ... in high heels."" The first couple's last dance of the night -- at the Eastern Ball -- happened shortly after 12:35 a.m. Wednesday.

15,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton decided to join her one-time rival's team because she wanted to be part of the ""greatest adventure of our century,"" she said Monday after President-elect Barack Obama named her as his nominee for secretary of state. Sen. Hillary Clinton addresses the media in Chicago on Monday while President-elect Barack Obama looks on. ""President Kennedy once said that engaging the world to meet the threats we face was the greatest adventure of our century,"" Clinton said during a news conference in Chicago, Illinois, when Obama unveiled his national security team. ""Well, Mr. President-elect, I am proud to join you on what will be a difficult and exciting adventure in this new century."" Clinton said she would work to restore America's position as ""a force for positive change"" in the world. ""America is a place founded on the idea that everyone should have the right to live up to his or her God-given potential. And it is that same ideal that must guide America's purpose in the world today,"" she said.  Watch Clinton accept Obama's offer » . During the news conference, Obama called Clinton a woman of ""extraordinary intelligence and toughness"" who will ""command respect in every capital."" ""Hillary's appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew American diplomacy and restore our alliances,"" Obama said. Speculation that Obama would appoint his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination to the nation's top diplomatic post surfaced after the two meet secretly in Chicago in mid-November. When Clinton's name was first mentioned for secretary of state, the Obama team reviewed the relationships her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had forged as part of his charitable foundation work. The Obama team was concerned that the relationships could create conflicts of interest. To address those concerns, the former president agreed to disclose the names of the more than 200,000 donors to his presidential foundation, a move he had previously resisted, Obama aides told CNN on Sunday. He also agreed to separate his work with the Clinton Global Initiative from his foundation work and submit the text of future speeches and other activities to State Department officials for review, the Obama aides said. In a statement, President Clinton said he was ""deeply proud"" that Obama has chosen his wife to be secretary of state. ""She is the right person for the job of helping to restore America's image abroad, end the war in Iraq, advance peace and increase our security, by building a future for our children with more partners and fewer adversaries, one of shared responsibilities and opportunities,"" he said. During the presidential campaign, Obama and Clinton traded tough statements on foreign policy, but, now, Obama and Clinton will be in the same administration, albeit one led by Obama.  Watch more about the other members of the security team » . In a now famous ad that showed a telephone ringing at 3 a.m., Clinton challenged Obama's readiness to handle foreign policy crises. Later, Obama questioned Clinton's argument that she had more foreign policy experience. But during the news conference, Obama dismissed any lingering resentment between himself and Clinton as a result of the tough campaign. Clinton and the other members of the national security team ""would not have agreed to join my administration -- and I would not have asked them to be part of this administration -- unless we shared a core vision of what's needed to keep the American people safe and to assure prosperity here at home and peace abroad,"" he said. Obama said there was not a ""light bulb moment"" when he decided to ask Clinton to be his secretary of state but would not reveal details on the talks that led up to him asking his former rival to join his team.  Watch Obama praise Clinton's abilities » . ""I have always admired Sen. Clinton. We have worked together extensively in the Senate,"" Obama said. ""After the election was over and I began to think about my team, it occurred to me that she could potentially be an outstanding secretary of state,"" he said. ""I extended her the offer, and she accepted. I know that's not as juicy a story as you were hoping for, but that's all you are going to get."" Clinton will also be working with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, whom Obama asked to stay on when he takes office.  Watch Gates on why he is staying » . Gates was responsible for implementing an increase in troop strength in Iraq that both Obama and Clinton criticized while on the campaign trail. He will now, however, work to implement the drawdown of troops in Iraq that the president-elect promised during the campaign. After announcing Clinton and the rest of his national security team, Obama said he was sure that team members shared ""a core vision of what's needed to keep the American people safe,"" but he also wanted ""strong personalities and strong opinions"" in his administration. ""I think that's how the best decisions are made,"" Obama said. ""One of the dangers in the White House, based on my reading of history, is that you get wrapped up in groupthink, and everybody agrees with everything, and there is no discussion and there are no dissenting views.""

A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says Sasha Obama is from a generation raised in a diverse world and open to possibility. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There are so many things that we could take away and remember forever regarding the inauguration of the first African-American president in the history of the United States, but I'll always remember the laughter of a little girl. Shortly after President-elect Barack Obama finished the oath and became President Barack Obama, he joined hands with his family and waved to the cheering voices of 1.8 million people packed from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. People cried, others hugged, celebrities and everyday folks snapped photos to capture the moment. There really was an amazing energy that permeated the crowd as we all witnessed a barrier come tumbling down before our eyes. But what stood out for me was a moment when President Obama looked down at his 7-year-old daughter, Sasha, and she said something to him, and then let out this huge laugh. I don't know whether it was her statement or his response, but the bubbly child was having the time of her life. The sheer joy that was on her face as she grinned from ear to ear caused me to just start laughing as I watched her reaction. I was shooting photos from the CNN platform just across from where he spoke, and one of the many images was of a beaming Sasha alongside her mom and 10-year-old sister, Malia. Can you imagine what was going through this young girl's mind, to see her father stand there and take the oath of office? As I saw her that day, and later bouncing along a sidewalk as she walked with her father, my niece Anastacia came to mind. Their smiles and bouncy walk are so much alike, and both are the same age. These young girls, and countless other black children, among others, will grow up in an America where what they can imagine is backed up by what they see. Despite the reality that racism hasn't left us, these children have the advantage of not being burdened with being separated by race. So much has been written about today's generation living in a world where hip-hop music brought them all together in one room, coupled with the diverse images on television and movies. Their reality is not the reality of their parents, and we will see that play out a lot in the future. What also is most compelling about this age of Obama is how he has been received thus far internationally. Many political experts are simply stunned that a man who has only been on the national stage for five years would have so much good will across the pond. Of course, a lot of that has to do with the fact that President George W. Bush and his team were seen as running roughshod over their international partners, praising them when they needed something, and savaging them when they disagreed with the U.S. position. Yet what we also can't ignore is that Obama's skin tone also plays a central role. Americans may be shocked to find out that people of color make up two-thirds of the world population. They know all too well about America's pathetic and violent history of enslaving and later oppressing African-Americans, and it was always seen as ridiculous for U.S. officials to condemn human rights abuses abroad while racial and other forms of discrimination existed in their own backyard. Obama's election sends a powerful signal to the world that Americans are backing up their rhetoric and ideals with action, and Obama serves as that powerful symbol. Barack Hussein Obama now has the opportunity to show those who voted for him -- and those who didn't -- that the change he often spoke about can come to pass. If he is able to fulfill many of the promises he made during the campaign, he will go down as one of America's most successful presidents, looked at fondly by the American people. And if he does, maybe we'll end up having the same smile he received courtesy of Sasha. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.",0.77682966,2194
20,"(CNN) -- Michelle Obama, wife of Sen. Barack Obama, is honing her message for the fall, aides say. Sen. Barack Obama and wife, Michelle, have been thrust into the public eye. ""Michelle wrote her own stump (speech). And you know, she's refining it now I think as we're going into the general election,"" said senior Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. ""We have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver. So she's really working on it as we speak."" Her new speeches will include more details about her family and humble upbringing on Chicago's South Side, aides said. Michelle Obama graduated from Harvard Law School, was a vice president at the University of Chicago and landed a job as a health care executive making $275,000 a year. But along with her success has come criticism -- that's she's too angry, too negative and too sarcastic. Now, the woman who would become the first black first lady is trying to connect with voters on a more personal level.  Watch experts weigh in on how Michelle Obama is perceived » . On Wednesday, she made an appearance as a guest co-host on ABC's ""The View,"" and later this week, she and her husband will grace the cover of Us Weekly. The magazine is headlined ""Michelle Obama: Why Barack Loves Her,"" and includes details about her love for Target, ""Sex and the City"" and her daughters' recitals. Asked Wednesday while on ""The View"" if she's going through a makeover, she said she realizes ""I wear my heart on my sleeve"" and that ""it's a risk you have to take.""  She said she thinks people will change their perception of her as they see her family more. Michelle Obama's spokeswoman, Katie McCormick Lelyveld, said earlier there is no ""image makeover"" in the works.  Watch what Michelle Obama would be like as first lady » . ""She has staff engaged in simply part of the process of growing to a general election campaign and putting a strategy together to help people get to know her,"" Lelyveld said. ""It's what you do as you move from primary voters to general election voters.""

""One comment made off-hand ... might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition,"" he said. Michelle Obama saw that in February when a Republican ad used a snippet from a campaign event in which, referring to record voter turnout in the Democratic primaries, she said, ""for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country."" Obama's campaign says she was just excited about the grassroots support, but her words still provided fodder for her husband's opponents. The day after the comments, Cindy McCain, wife of presumptive Republican nominee John McCain, introduced her husband saying, ""I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier -- I am very proud of my country."" Michelle Obama has been a vocal advocate for her husband while on the campaign trail, delivering sometimes impassioned speeches on his behalf. Robin Givhan, fashion editor with the Washington Post, said people see Michelle Obama in different ways. ""Some people will see confidence, and others might see cockiness. I think some people will see strength. Others might see arrogance,"" she said. ""She comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with."" Behind the scenes, she maintains that independence. According to the campaign, Michelle Obama picks out her own clothes. She received a lot of attention for the sleeveless purple dress and pearls she wore the night her husband became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Beyond her style, though, a sense of dignity may be what most defines a first lady. It's a job that requires the ability to strike a balance between queen and commoner. Exactly how Michelle Obama refines her approach on the stump remains to be seen, staffers said. ""We'll see,"" Jarrett said. ""She's learned a lot of stories along the way from the American people, I think she may incorporate some more of the stories that she's heard that resonate with what she's seeing in terms of the direction that people want the country to take.

The clearing out of the Bushes' belongings began over the summer, when many items were packed and taken to Crawford, Texas, says Anita McBride, chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush. Then, during the Christmas holiday, the Bushes moved their personal things out of Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to McBride. On January 20, the Obamas move in -- a side of Inauguration Day that most people never see: a grueling, precisely timed workday involving scores of staffers that follows six months of careful planning. Gary Walters worked at the executive mansion from 1986 until 2006 as chief usher in charge of moving presidential families in and out of the White House. From his Virginia home, Walters described how the complicated Obama move in to the White House is completed in only a few hours. In the morning, after the Bushes and Obamas depart the executive mansion for the Capitol Hill swearing-in ceremony, moving trucks will roll up to the south side of the White House, Walters said. The drivers put down their tailgates, allowing most of the White House's 93 staff members to begin unloading Obama family items, he said. ""Staff members all have been given very specific jobs on that day, almost down to the minute as to what their responsibilities are,"" Walters said. The move is designed to be seamless, painless and invisible while millions of Washington visitors -- and millions more watching on TV -- follow the inauguration ceremonies and the parade that follows. By about 5 p.m., before the Obamas move from the parade viewing stand to their new home, the presidential move must be complete. ""Their clothes will be in their closets; everything will be put away,"" Walters said. ""There should be no full or half-empty boxes will in view. Furniture will be set in proper places. Their favorite foods will be in the kitchen or the pantry. The chief usher will welcome them into their home and ask them what they would like to do before going out to enjoy the inaugural balls."" Incoming first lady Michelle Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, will also be moving into the White House residence, which has 24 rooms on the second and third floors. The Obamas have hired California decorator Michael Smith to use an allocated $100,000 to redecorate the space.  Watch what decorator may do with the White House » . ""I think they're going to find that this is really conducive to family life,"" President Bush told CNN's Larry King. ""President-elect Obama has got a 45-second commute to see his girls."" In the West Wing of the White House, the political jostling has begun among new staffers to grab workspaces near the center of power: the Oval Office. There, the carpet is changed with each new administration to suit the incoming president, Walters said. Possibly, the office desk will be changed, as will paintings that will be hung on the wall. Books on the Oval Office shelves will be changed per the new commander in chief, as will accessories to be placed around the room, Walters said. Staffers may tote in a new sofa and chairs -- or busts of past presidents. Following tradition, Bush is expected to leave a personal letter written to Obama. Past letters have offered the new president private words of advice and reflection. Several Democratic presidents have chosen to hang a Thomas Sully painting of President Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office, said political scientist and historian Martha Joynt Kumar, an expert on the White House. ""In the residence, many presidents have brought their personal paintings to decorate their living space."" After movers tote out boxes of office materials from Bush staffers, the West Wing will become a dusty workspace, with empty bookshelves and the odd three-ring binder left behind, say veterans of the White House press corps. As in previous moving periods, contractors may come to slap on a coat of paint or lay carpet as the new crop of staffers finds their workspaces. ""It was incredible,"" former Clinton staffer David Seldin said, recalling his experience on Inauguration Day 1993. ""I think people were overwhelmed with the sense that it was real and the sense that something that you had been working on as a political campaign is actually becoming part of the government."" On Tuesday, once the whirlwind moving operation is finally done, Chief Usher Stephen Rochon will probably greet Obama the same way Walters did Bush in 2001. Standing near the doorway to the White House North Portico, Walters recalls, he said, ""Hello, Mr. President, welcome to your home."" Oh, and about those Os on White House keyboards -- two Bush officials told CNN on Sunday that outgoing aides won't be getting payback on the incoming Democratic administration. There is an understanding that Bush will be furious if there are any pranks, especially after cordial transition between the two administrations, the officials said.",0.77577734,2542
22,"(CNN) -- Following this week's tough talks on the global financial crisis, President Obama on Friday shifted his tone to reflect upon his regrets, his frustrations and his hopes for the younger generation. ""There's nothing more noble than public service,"" President Obama says. Obama's remarks came after a woman from Heidelberg, Germany, asked if he ever regretted having run for president. The question yielded a lengthy response from Obama, who is participating in his first overseas trip in office. ""That's a good question,"" Obama said at a packed town hall meeting in Strasbourg, France. ""Michelle definitely asked that question. ""You know, there have been times, certainly during the campaign, and there have been times over the last several months where you feel a lot of weight on your shoulders. There's no doubt about it,"" the president said. With his wife, Michelle, looking on, Obama continued, ""During the campaign, the biggest sacrifice -- the thing that was most difficult was that I was away from my family all the time.""  Watch Obama weigh in on his regrets and sacrifices » . The president joked that he was jealous of not only Europe's high-speed rail but also the fact that campaigns there only last a few months. Obama announced that he was running for president on February 10, 2007, and was inaugurated nearly two years later. ""So I was away from home all the time, and that was very difficult, because not only do I have a wonderful wife, but I have two perfect daughters, and so, you know, I missed them a lot,"" he said. The president expressed disappointment about the lack of privacy and anonymity he's experienced since assuming office. ""You know, it's very frustrating now,"" he said. ""It used to be when I came to Europe that I could just wander down to a cafe and sit and have some wine and watch people go by and go into a little shop and watch the sun go down. ""Now I'm in hotel rooms all the time. And I have security around me all the time. So just losing that ability to just take a walk, you know? That is something that is frustrating.""  Take a look at Obama's European itinerary » . After a couple of minutes of going over his regrets, Obama paused. ""But -- having said all that, I truly believe that there's nothing more noble than public service,"" he said, adding that service doesn't mean one has to run for president. Obama pointed to Doctors Without Borders, the United Nations and community work as examples of other ways to serve. ""But the point is that what I found at a very young age was that if you can only think about yourself -- 'How much money can I make? What can I buy? How nice is my house? What kind of fancy car do I have?' -- that over the long term, I think you get bored,"" he told the audience of mostly students. ""I think if you're only thinking about yourself, your life becomes diminished, and the way to live a full life is to think about what can I do for others, how can I be a part of this larger project of making a better world,"" he said. Obama said with all the challenges facing the world now, the younger generation has an abundance of opportunities to make a difference. ""It would be a tragedy if all of you who are so talented and energetic -- if you let that go to waste, if you just stood back and watched the world pass you by,"" he said. ""Better to jump in, get involved -- and it does mean that sometimes you'll get criticized and sometimes you'll fail and sometimes you'll be disappointed -- but you'll have a great adventure. And at the end of your life, hopefully you'll be able to look back and say, 'I made a difference.' """,0.77274656,2322
23,"ARNOLD, Missouri (CNN)  -- On his 100th day in office, President Obama said Wednesday that he was ""pleased with the progress we've made but not satisfied."" Obama marked his 100th day in office Wednesday with a town hall meeting and later a news conference. ""I've come back to report to you, the American people, that we have begun to pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off, and we've begun the work of remaking America,"" the president said at a town hall meeting in a high school gymnasium in Arnold, a St. Louis suburb. ""I'm confident in the future, but not I'm not content with the present,"" he said. ""You know the progress comes from hard choices and hard work, not miracles. I'm not a miracle worker,"" he said. Obama acknowledged challenges of ""unprecedented size and scope,"" including the recession. These challenges, he said, could not be met with ""half measures."" ""They demand action that is bold and sustained. They call on us to clear away the wreckage of a painful recession, But also, at the same time, lay the building blocks for a new prosperity. And that's the work that we've begun over these first 100 days,"" he said. He responded to critics who say he is trying to do too much as he works to address the recession as well as health care, energy and education. ""There's no mystery to what we've done; the priorities that we've acted upon were the things that we said we'd do during the campaign,"" he said, prompting loud applause. The president made an opening statement that lasted about 20 minutes before taking questions from the audience. The last question was from a fourth-grade girl who asked about the administration's environmental policies. Later Wednesday, Obama will hold a prime-time news conference in the East Room of the White House. Leading up to the date, White House aides had labeled the 100th day as a ""Hallmark"" holiday. ""They don't mean anything,"" quipped one aide, ""but you have to observe them."" More than six in 10 Americans approve of the job Obama is doing as president, a recent poll of polls shows.

24,"(CNN) -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell has a choice blend of political and military experience, and many thought he'd make a great president, but Powell said Wednesday that he just didn't have it in him. Colin Powell, left, embraces Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel at the inauguration Tuesday. His wife, Alma, had feared that such an endeavor would change their family life. She also had concerns about Powell's safety, he said Wednesday on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""But I was a soldier. That wasn't my concern,"" he said. ""I never found inside of me the internal passion that you've got to have to run for elected office."" Many GOP pundits had hoped Powell, who served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Bush's father and President Clinton, would make a run at the Oval Office. The former four-star general and Vietnam War veteran's military credentials are staunch, rivaled only by his accomplishments as a statesman.  Watch Powell explain why the White House wasn't for him » . In addition to chairing the Joint Chiefs, the lifelong Republican served as national security adviser under President Reagan and oversaw the 1989 invasion of Panama that toppled Gen. Manuel Noriega as well as Operation Desert Storm during the 1991 Gulf War. He has two Presidential Medals of Freedom to his name. As Bush's secretary of state, he spearheaded efforts to increase U.S. foreign assistance throughout the world, and he helped develop Bush's HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment program, which is credited with being the largest such endeavor ever. However, Powell drew heavy criticism over his remarks before the United Nations that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Powell made the assertion while attempting to convince the world body that the U.S. should go to war with Iraq. Powell abruptly retired from Bush's Cabinet in 2005, but he did not cite his time a secretary of state Wednesday when explaining why he never sought the presidency. ""I never woke up a single morning to go think about this, to talk to people about it and find in my heart and soul the passion that a Barack Obama or a John McCain or a George Bush or a Bill Clinton had,"" he said. ""It just wasn't me, and you've got to be true to yourself, and I've tried to be true to myself."" The stance is not new for Powell, who held a news conference in November 1995 to announce that he would not run for president. ""To offer myself as a candidate for president requires a commitment and a passion to run the race and to succeed in the quest,"" he said then, ""a passion and commitment that, despite my every effort, I do not yet have for political life, because such a life requires a calling that I do not yet hear."" No stranger to advising presidents, Powell told CNN that Obama has a great deal of work ahead. Not only does he have to deal with the crisis du jour -- like righting the economy at home -- he needs to keep his eyes on crises abroad while never foregoing long-range planning.  Watch what Powell says Obama must do » . ""You can never avoid it,"" he said. ""Once you're the president, every crisis comes to your desk, and you have to deal with it. ... But that doesn't mean that you can't stand back and look farther out."" Repairing America's broken image and poverty alleviation -- both at home and abroad -- will pose major challenges, he said, and both have wide-ranging implications. Poverty incubates terror, and it is incumbent upon the U.S. to stamp out the hunger, unemployment and illiteracy that breed suicide bombers and other insurgents, Powell said. He called poverty alleviation ""one of the most important challenges facing the world."" ""For those of us who are wealthy, we should reach out not only to our own citizens who need help, but the rest of the world,"" he said. ""If you want to get rid of sources of terrorism, if you want to get people moving in the right direction, you've got to help them get jobs, clean water, health care for their kids, educate their kids -- and America has a great responsibility to do this."" Obama also needs to consider what other nations think of the U.S. and help repair the American reputation. The challenge is daunting, but Powell said America's good standing is ""recoverable."" The sea of diverse faces in attendance at Obama's inauguration ceremony speaks to the reverence that America still enjoys in the world, said the son of Jamaican immigrants and father of three. If Obama can turn the economy around and rectify situations in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East, he will begin repairing the nation's image, ""because there's still a solid, residual level of affection and respect for the United States of America."" But Powell acknowledges that his former boss and Obama's predecessor made things difficult. ""Iraq and the Guantanamo situation -- which I have been preaching for years should have been closed years ago -- Abu Ghraib and a lack of progress in the Middle East and a certain way in which we deal with the world on international issues, I think damaged our reputation with the world,"" he said. Obama is off to a good start, he said, and is doing the right thing by reaching across the aisle for help. It was gracious of Obama to hold a dinner in Sen. John McCain's honor after a testy campaign and gracious of McCain to accept, and Powell said he hopes that spirit will permeate Obama's presidency. Powell conceded, though, that bipartisanship won't always be the answer to Obama's problems and said the 44th president will need to rely on the wisdom of those who forged the country more than two centuries ago. ""We're supposed to be a partisan country. That's the way the founding fathers intended for us to move forward,"" he said. ""People have strong views on both sides of an issue. Argue it out. Fight it out, just like they did in that summer of 1787 when they were writing the Constitution -- and then ultimately both sides make compromises in order to achieve consensus, and then you move the country forward.""

Complete economic recovery will take time, he warned, but added that the situation appeared to be getting better. On the hostile debate over his push to overhaul the nation's health care system, Obama disagreed with the analysis by some that the public anger against him is fueled by racism. He drew a big laugh by pointing out he was black before he became president, then noted that his election by the American public ""tells you ... a lot about where the country is at."" ""I think that what's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes, particularly during times of economic unease, then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up,"" Obama said.

28,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than two dozen guests joined first lady Michelle Obama at the president's speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. Leonard Abess Jr. was recognized by President Obama during Tuesday's State of the Nation speech. One person on the first lady's guest list was Leonard Abess Jr., a Miami banker who received a $60 million bonus from the proceeds from the sale of shares of City National Bank in Florida and gave it out to his 399 workers and 72 former workers. During his speech, President Obama said Abess didn't tell anyone about his generosity, but when the local newspaper found out, Abess simply said, ""I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old. I didn't feel right getting the money myself."" Abess demonstrates the kind of ""responsibility"" the president has called for from high-profile financial CEOs, the White House said. Obama contrasted Abess' story with the greed that he said got the country into the problems it faces now. ""CEOs won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks, or buy fancy drapes, or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over,"" Obama said. Obama also referenced in his speech an eighth-grader who wrote a letter to members of Congress appealing for help in rebuilding her deteriorating school. Ty'Sheoma Bethea, a student at the J.V. Martin Junior High School in Dillon, South Carolina, was invited after a letter she sent lawmakers appealing for help rebuilding her school made its way to President Obama. Obama talked about the school during his first news conference earlier in February as evidence of crumbling schools across the country. Other guests of the first lady Tuesday night included injured Afghanistan veteran Spc. Jonathan N. James, equal pay advocate Lilly Ledbetter and Blake Jones, the co-founder and president of a solar electric company. The president and first lady  also invited Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas -- one of the president's key Republican allies among the nation's governors in passing the massive $787 billion stimulus bill -- and Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a key Democratic governor whose state is among the hardest hit by the economic downturn. The practice of inviting guests to sit in the House Gallery is a tradition dating back to 1982 when president Ronald Reagan recognized Lenny Skutnick -- a good Samaritan who pulled a survivor out of the frozen Potomac River in Washington after an Air Florida plane crashed into the 14th Street Bridge. Since then, presidential administrations steadily increased the number of invitees to the first lady box, often including prominent athletes and celebrities, citizen heroes, members of the military, and individuals likely to benefit from policies proposed by the president. It has also become customary for the president to acknowledge a handful of guests sitting in the box during his speech, especially those who have a particularly compelling story or illustrate a point he is trying to make.

29,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama toasted a growing U.S. friendship with India at the first state dinner of his administration Tuesday, an evening of regal pageantry and symbolic politics in a tent on the White House South Lawn. ""To the future that beckons all of us,"" Obama said with glass raised toward his guest of honor, visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ""Let us answer its call. And let our two great nations realize all the triumphs and achievements that await us."" A tradition dating back to 1874, state dinners are the most treasured and formal honor a U.S. president can offer a foreign dignitary, and the most coveted invitation in Washington. The Tuesday night dinner showed Obama's intention to signal strong ties with the world's largest democracy and go his own way in navigating the pomp and tradition of White House customs. Traditionally, a new administration's first invitation goes to the leader of neighboring Canada or Mexico, though recent presidents also haven't followed that precedent. The event planned by first lady Michelle Obama emphasized eco-friendly themes such as White House-grown herbs and lettuce served to guests and sustainably harvested magnolia branches -- from species native to both India and the United States -- in arrangements adorning the tent where more than 300 guests wearing tuxedos and gowns were wined, dined and entertained. A White House document said common themes of state and official visits are ""forging friendships, exchanging knowledge and building bridges that last for years."" In a toast that followed Obama's, Singh praised his host's leadership and prompted applause by citing the charm of the U.S. first lady. Obama's election was ""an inspiration to all those who cherish the values of diversity, democracy and equal opportunity,"" Singh said, adding that India ""warmly applauded"" the Nobel Peace Prize awarded Obama this year for ""the healing touch you have provided and the power of your idealism and your vision."" ""We need to find new pathways of international cooperation that respond more effectively to the grave challenges caused by the growing interdependence of nations,"" Singh said. ""As two leading democracies, India and the United States must play a leading role in building a shared destiny for all humankind."" Obama, in a black tuxedo, and the first lady, in a dazzling cream gown with silver accents, greeted Singh and his wife, Gursharan Kaur, as they arrived, shaking hands on the White House steps and posing for pictures before leading their guests inside. Guests in tuxedos and evening gowns streamed into the White House for the historic social event, passing a line of journalists. In one humorous mishap, the cummerbund of Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, fell off as he and his wife walked in. The guest list included political allies, a few opponents, celebrities and members of the Indian diplomatic community. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the list, but not her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Democratic colleagues of the president including other Cabinet ministers, several senators and top aides made the list, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts (but not his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and White House Budget Director Peter Orszag. Ticker: See the list of expected attendees . A couple of Republicans also made it, notably Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Celebrities included Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, actors Alfre Woodard and Blair Underwood, CBS News anchor Katie Couric and New York Times columnist Tom Friedman. However, one name rumored to be included, but not appearing on the list, was Oprah Winfrey. The dinner, in a tent set up on the White House South Lawn with a view of the Washington Monument, featured round tables for 10 set in resplendent colors -- apple green, ruby, gold -- with floral arrangements of roses, hydrangeas and sweet peas in plum, purple and fuchsia. Place settings in fine china from three previous administrations -- Eisenhower, Clinton and George W. Bush -- were flanked by five pieces of silverware and crystal glasses. Place cards were in script -- ""The President"" and ""Mrs. Obama"" read two. A seasonal menu reflecting both American and Indian flavors started with a potato and eggplant salad made with White House-grown arugula and accompanied by an onion seed vinaigrette, according to the White House. Red lentil soup with fresh cheese followed, and then a choice of entrees -- roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chick peas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns, caramelized salsify and smoked collard greens. Dessert was pumpkin pie tart and pear tatin with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Each course was paired with a different wine, all of American vintage. The herbs and lettuces were harvested from the White House Kitchen Garden started by Michelle Obama, with honey from the White House beehive used to poach the dessert pears. Entertainment was by jazz vocalist Kurt Elling, Grammy and Academy Award-winner Jennifer Hudson, the National Symphony Orchestra directed by award-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch, Academy Award-winning Indian musician and composer A.R. Rahman, and The President's Own United States Marine Band. ""It's not every day you get to sing at the White House or even get invited to the White House,"" said Hudson, who said she would dress in a purple and black gown ""with the longest train I've ever worn"" and sing standards including ""The Very Thought of You,"" ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" and ""Somewhere."" Veterans of state dinners said the planning for such a trend-setting event is meticulous. ""It's stressful, it's very stressful,"" said Lisa Caputo, a press secretary for Hillary Clinton when she was first lady. ""What is the first lady going to wear? What will be served? How are the flower arrangements being done? There's a lot of protocol in terms of the serving line."" Every unit in the White House weighs in on the dinner's guest list, Caputo said, with a lot of thought going into who sits where. ""There's particular protocol in terms of who is seated at the president's table and the prime minister's table,"" Caputo said. ""But don't forget that an enormous amount of thought goes into that with the White House social office and the president and first lady in terms of who will round out the appropriate table, who will get along with who, what will be the dynamics of each table. ""Yes, of course it's social, but, of course, there's business done,"" Caputo said. The final list is ultimately decided by the president and the first lady, said Anita McBride, who was chief of staff for first lady Laura Bush. ""Of course, having friends and supporters is really important to share that kind of event, and it's also important for all the other guests that are there and the Indian members of the delegation to meet these people that are a cross-section of America,"" McBride said. Amy Zantzinger, who was a social secretary for President George W. Bush, said all state dinners are different, and an administration's first one is a big one. ""First they'll bring the newness -- the newness of the whole day because it's their first big dinner,"" she said. What makes a successful dinner? It's what you don't plan, Zantzinger said. During a Reagan state dinner, Princess Diana and actor John Travolta took to the dance floor. ""What made it so special was that it was so absolutely spontaneous,"" she said. ""You had one of the most beautiful women in the world and one of the best dancers in the world come together in this incredible place, and I think the spontaneity of it and the combination of the two of them was perfection.""

30,"(CNN) -- Luci Baines Johnson was just 16 years old when she approached her father, President Johnson, with what she considered a reasonable request. Luci Baines Johnson, left, and her older sister, Lynda Bird, pose inside the White House in 1963. ""I asked my father if we could have the Beatles come to play at the White House,"" she recalled. ""I was very excited about it."" His response? A decisive no, ""without even any moment of trying to soften the blow,"" Johnson said in a recent phone interview. The president thought the move would be viewed as self-serving. His daughter, however, saw it as a chance to honor ""a great talent"" and strengthen ties between the United States and Great Britain -- not to mention a golden opportunity for her and her friends. ""I could see how different sets of folks could have either perspective. And I suspect my father could see that too,"" she said. Luci Baines Johnson learned quickly of the scrutiny that came from being a first daughter. Her family moved into the White House in 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Johnson was catapulted into the exclusive fraternity of White House families and embraced what she describes as a role she landed simply by chance. That fraternity has most recently expanded to include President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia. ""I was an eyewitness to history, over and over, during my father's five years in the White House. And I wasn't elected to that option. I had no qualifications that provided me that privilege except an accident of birth,"" she said.  See famous first kids who grew up in the White House » . Johnson speaks fondly of the opportunity she was afforded to dine with kings and queens, meet the movers and shakers of her time, engage with the body of America and hold a front-row seat to history. While most of her memories fall into two categories -- ""the fond personal memories"" and ""the fond memories of public privilege"" -- there's one in particular that was a combination of both. ""My 17th birthday, I received a handwritten note from my father, the only handwritten note I have, telling me how much he loves me and how much he has delighted in having me as his daughter for all those 17 years,"" she said. The note was dated noon, July 2, 1964. Six hours later, in the East Room of the White House, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination based on race or gender in public places, schools and places of employment. ""Can you imagine ever receiving a more momentous, glorious, exciting, thrilling birthday present that lasted forever and ever than something like that, that would change the world for all time and make it a much more decent place? That took place on my birthday,"" she said. Life in the White House, however, came at a cost. Johnson and the first children before and after her will always have to ""pay a big price in terms of personal time,"" she said. More than 45 years after she moved into the White House, she still receives requests for interviews about the time she spent there. But the public's interest in first daughters is nothing new. Fanny Hayes, for example, who was about the same age as Malia when she moved into the White House in 1877, was followed by the media until the day she died. ""She was an American celebrity,"" said presidential historian Doug Wead. While the interest in first daughters has stayed steady, the pressure on the children has intensified, said Wead, author of ""All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families."" ""It's like the Miss America contest -- it's a real dilemma for the daughter of a president. She's supposed to be gracious. She's mocked and ridiculed if she isn't pretty,"" he said. When Chelsea Clinton was just 13 years old, for example, she was ridiculed in a 1993 ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch that declared her ""not a babe."" Actor Mike Myers later apologized, and the skit was cut from replays of the show. Amy Carter, who was 9 when she moved into the White House, was also mocked for her appearance and for her poor manners, after she pulled out a book during a state dinner. Her parents enrolled her in public school, illuminating the already bright spotlight on her. An infamous photograph of her first day at school shows the young girl with her head hanging low, carrying a Snoopy book bag and surrounded by a swarm of paparazzi. To this date, no other presidential children have attended public school. But other presidential children have taken on power roles in their fathers' administrations. Anna Roosevelt, for example, was a ""super aide"" to Franklin D. Roosevelt during his last year in office, Wead said, describing her as a combination of a personal secretary and chief of staff, not to mention popular in the public eye. And Alice Roosevelt, a fashion icon who was known to have quite the rebellious streak, also played a pivotal role for her father, Theodore Roosevelt. She went on an around-the-world junket for the purposes of American foreign policy -- a move that diverted attention from her father's efforts to bring about a peace treaty in the Russo-Japanese War, Wead said. The president later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on various peace treaties. Under the administration that followed, William Taft's daughter became one of the unsung heroes of women's rights, Wead said. Taft credited his daughter, Helen, for helping to change his mind about women's suffrage. But for all presidential children, Wead said, there remains a lifelong battle of seeking approval from their fathers while struggling to carve their own identities. Many presidential daughters have gone on to author books about their time in White House, in what Wead describes as an attempt to restore their fathers' reputations. ""It's like sitting in front of a big window ... and seeing a billboard with misspelled words on it. It's just irritating,"" he said. ""And the writing of a book, if it doesn't change history, it is a purifying experience for the child."" Susan Ford Bales once told the San Francisco Chronicle that while in the White House, ""I kept thinking, I want to be normal. But I can't be normal. .... Everyone was watching. It was like living out loud."" But Ford also cashed in on some of the perks of her high-profile position and took Alice Roosevelt's advice to ""have one hell of a good time."" Ford roller-skated through the White House, held her prom in the East Room and scored VIP treatment at concerts -- including a backstage pass to see Rod Stewart. (That move ignited the public's interest in her, sparking rumors that she and Stewart were engaged.) Johnson said that some of the best advice she received while in the White House was to just recognize that she couldn't change things or make the attention go away. ""There are inevitably going to be moments when you feel like the pressures of the goldfish bowl seem unfair or more than you can bear, but so are the opportunities to learn, to understand, to grow, to love, to make friends, to witness,"" she said. ""I describe it as the best of times and sometimes the worst of times, but whatever the times, it was a time of extraordinary privilege.""",0.7542607,6335
31,"(CNN)  -- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama defended himself and his wife Sunday against suggestions that they are insufficiently patriotic. Sen. Barack Obama defended himself and his wife against recent suggestions that they are not patriotic. After a town hall meeting in Lorain, Ohio, a reporter asked Obama about ""an attempt by conservatives and Republicans to paint you as unpatriotic."" The reporter cited the fact that Obama once failed to put his hand over his heart while singing the national anthem. Obama replied that his choice not to put his hand on his heart is a behavior that ""would disqualify about three-quarters of the people who have ever gone to a football game or baseball game."" The reporter also noted that the Illinois senator does not wear an American flag lapel pin, has met with former members of the radical anti-Vietnam War group, Weather Underground, and his wife was quoted recently as saying she never felt really proud of the United States until recently. Asked how he would fight the image of being unpatriotic, Obama said, ""There's always some nonsense going on in general elections. Right? If it wasn't this, it would be something else. If you recall, first it was my name. Right? That was a problem. And then there was the Muslim e-mail thing and that hasn't worked out so well, and now it's the patriotism thing. ""The way I will respond to it is with the truth: that I owe everything I am to this country,"" he said. The first-term senator from Illinois has been the subject of various debunked rumors since launching his presidential campaign -- allegations that he is a Muslim, that he took his oath of office on a copy of the Quran and that he attended a radical Islamic school while living in Indonesia as a boy. ""You will recall that the reason I came to national attention was a speech in which I spoke of my love of this country,"" said Obama. He and his wife, Michelle, had already explained her comments. ""She simply misspoke,"" he said. ""What she was referring to was [that] this was the first time she has been proud of politics in America.  Watch what Michelle Obama said » . ""That's true of a lot of people who have been cynical and disenchanted. And she's spoken about how she has been cynical about American politics for a very long time, but she's proud of how people are participating and getting involved in ways that they haven't in a very long time."" About not wearing an American flag lapel pin, Obama said Republicans have no lock on patriotism. ""A party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed, or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning, or are not fulfilling the veterans' benefits that these troops need when they come home, or are undermining our Constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary? ""That is a debate I am very happy to have. We'll see what the American people think is the true definition of patriotism."" Obama did not respond to the question about the Weather Underground, a group whose members bombed the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon during the 1970s. Last week, the New York Sun reported that as an Illinois state senator in 2001, Obama accepted a $200 contribution from William Ayers, a founder of the group who was not convicted for the bombings and now works as a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. But the paper said that, in a statement, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, William Burton, said, ""Sen. Obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the Weathermen group, as he does all acts of violence ... But he was an 8-year-old child when Ayers and the Weathermen were active, and any attempt to connect Obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous."" Former first lady Sen.

33,"BENTON HARBOR, Michigan (CNN) -- Former President Bush said that if Laura Bush hadn't been his wife, he isn't sure he could have counted on her vote. Laura Bush's ""patience and her enthusiasm ... made our marriage a really good marriage,"" President Bush said. ""I can promise you that her life dream when she was growing up was not to be first lady of the United States,"" he told a Michigan audience in one of his first major domestic speeches since leaving the White House. ""Frankly, I am not so sure that if we hadn't married, she'd have voted for me,"" he joked of his wife, who was raised in a Democratic family. The high-tension atmosphere of the presidency strengthened his marriage, Bush said. ""There's a lot of pressure in the White House, as I'm sure you can imagine. Pressure sometimes can make a marriage stronger or weaker. In my case because of her patience and her enthusiasm, it made our marriage a really good marriage,"" Bush said. The pressure of the presidency, he said, weighs most on family members. ""It's much harder to be the son of the president than to be the president. And it's much harder to be the father of the president than to be the president,"" he said in a reference to his dad, former President George H.W. Bush. ""And I used to have to admonish him not pay attention to what they were writing on the editorial pages about his son. I had gone through the same agony myself. And so I am confident that the end of the presidency is a great relief because of our strong love."" Something else Bush called a great relief: having a vice president, Dick Cheney, who had no plans to run for the top spot. ""I was pleased to have someone serve as my vice president who was not running for president, because someone who is running for president, at times, will try to distance themselves,"" Bush said. ""If things got tough, [he] could be one of the first persons off the ship, and that would be really unpleasant in the White House."" Bush said he wasn't surprised to lose public support for some of the main elements of his national security agenda. ""I was frustrated because the stakes were so high in some of the decisions that I had to make. I wasn't surprised that people would forget the feeling of how they felt after September 11. I was grateful that people were moving beyond September 11. As a president, you don't want your nation to be so worried about an attack that people don't go about their lives. ... The psychology of the nation concerned me. Which then made it harder to get people to listen to you, to some of the decisions I made."" The fact that Americans tuned out media coverage of the risk of terrorism wasn't surprising to him either, he said; he ignored most news coverage himself. ""The truth of the matter is, I never watched the nightly news, because it was predictable, I thought. Nor did I ever pay attention to the editorial pages, good editorials or bad,"" he said. ""I knew what was in the news. When you're president, you can get so obsessed with this stuff that I felt it would cloud your vision. ""The truth of the matter is, there is so much attention paid to you, I thought it was important even in the toughest moments to be upbeat and not to be so worried about myself that I couldn't convey a sense of confidence."" He mused on the transition to a far calmer existence after the presidency. ""People ask, what is it like? Well, I have never stopped at a traffic light for eight years,"" he said. ""The neighborhood we live in is nice. You know, Laura bought this house sight unseen. At least she saw. I didn't. It was like a faith-based initiative.""

34,"Editor's note: Ed Rollins, a senior political contributor for CNN, is senior presidential fellow at the Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University. He was White House political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ed Rollins says ""Saturday Night Live"" satire has shaped images of presidents for the worse. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Since its debut on October 11, 1975, ""Saturday Night Live"" has spoofed, ridiculed and hammered presidents and other political figures without regard to political affiliation or any other sensitivities. The perfect parroting of Sarah Palin after her vice president nomination, by the immensely talented Tina Fey, started the downward spiraling of the governor. People started looking at her in a different light, and she was judged as a less serious candidate. Saturday's skit portraying President Obama as a man who made a lot of promises and hasn't been able to fulfill many -- if any -- has been analyzed over and over with a constant rerun of the ""SNL"" clip. In the comedy skit, the president is asked about unrealized campaign promises, including closing Gitmo, combating global warming, allowing openly gay people to serve in the military, withdrawing from Iraq, improving the status of the fight in Afghanistan, reforming health care and several others. On screen the response on a check list was: that each item was ""not done.""  Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous. Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president.  See how 'SNL' has portrayed presidents »  President Gerald Ford, a gifted athlete, could never overcome the image of a bumbling, clumsy man who banged his head constantly after the hilarious portrayal of him by Chevy Chase. The senior Bush, George H.W., was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey, and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy, inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions. But the real question being debated on cable TV because of the ""SNL"" parody is this: ""Has the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?"" I can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers. In the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: ""Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?"" Democrats will add pensively to the words: ""Not Done"" from the ""SNL"" skit, ""Not yet."" Republicans would add assertively : ""Not ever!"" Democrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the ""Camelot II""; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Republicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter. But in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him. His campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition. Every president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun. It's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast. Giving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them. Sometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care. The ""Saturday Night Live"" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise. It was the promise that his $787 billion stimulus package would create 3.5 million new jobs. If ""SNL"" had asked the question, the answer would be: Not Done! The job hasn't even been started. The United States is losing more jobs by the minute. Before we turn this economy around, job loss could reach 9 million in the past two years and unemployment could reach 10.5 percent. This didn't happen all on his watch and a big chunk of the stimulus is not yet spent. But if we don't get Americans back to work, the other promises President Obama made will pale in importance. Focus on jobs, Mr. President. The highest unemployment rate in 25 years is about real Americans all across this country who are hurting and depressed. That's a topic that's even ""Saturday Night Live"" can't joke about, because it's tragic. All Americans want to see this president succeed in getting that job done. iReport.com: 'SNL' won't hurt Obama . The president has made a lot of promises regarding health care reform, even though the final details of the bills are not known. Promises made as president do count;, far more than those as a candidate. And the president will be measured against them. He will be judged not in a skit on ""Saturday Night Live"" but by his fellow citizens at the voting booth. And it will be no laughing matter if they feel he misled them.

When her name was mentioned in the media as a possible member of Obama's cabinet, Clinton said, she found the idea ""absurd."" ""And then when he called and asked me to come see him, and we had our first conversation, I said, 'You know, I really don't think I'm the person to do this, I want to go back to my life. I really feel like I owe it to the people of New York.' And I gave him a bunch of other names of people who I thought would be great secretaries of state."" But Obama ""was quite persistent and very persuasive,"" Clinton said. She added, ""Ultimately, it came down to my feeling that, number one, when your president asks you to do something for your country, you really need a good reason not to do it. Number two, if I had won and I had asked him to please help me serve our country, I would have hoped he would say yes. And finally, I looked around our world and I thought, you know, we are in just so many deep holes that everybody had better grab a shovel and start digging out."" Some analysts have raised questions about how much power Clinton actually has in the administration, given that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have done a great deal of international outreach themselves. The president has also appointed special envoys to focus on several key regions. But Clinton said she wanted the envoys appointed ""because we were inheriting so many hot spot problems that I knew you could never have one person possibly address all of that."" One of the biggest is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Clinton and the president have called on Israel to halt construction at settlements in the West Bank. Asked whether there is any room for compromise on that issue, Clinton said the administration would not ""prejudge the effort."" She said the administration is committed to Israel's security. ""We see historical, demographic, political, technological trends that are very troubling as to Israel's future. At the same time, there is a legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people that needs to be addressed."" On the nuclear standoff with Iran, Clinton said a diplomatic process in which U.S. representatives sit down with Iran's authorized representatives would give ""us information and insight that we don't have. ... We don't have any really clear sense as to what it is they are seeking."" Clinton also addressed the growing tensions surrounding North Korea, and what she called its ""very provocative and belligerent behavior"" with recent tests of missile and nuclear technology.

Fittingly for an election campaign that was won partly by galvanizing millions of young people to get out and vote via the Internet, Obama's inauguration ushered in a new digital age for the U.S. presidency. As the clock struck 12.01 in Washington Obama's administration took control of the White House Web site, with the simple words ""Change has come to America."" The first blog post by director of new media for the White House, Macon Phillips, said: ""Millions of Americans have powered President Obama's journey to the White House, many taking advantage of the Internet to play a role in shaping our country's future."" It was an unprecedented move in the history of presidential inaugurations and it reflected the mood of the blogosphere, which came alive with comments as excitable bloggers mulled on topics ranging from what Michelle Obama would wear to their thoughts on Obama's speech.  Watch President Obama's full speech » . The New Yorker's George Packer wrote in his blog that ""President  Obama uttered no words today that will be quoted in a hundred years."" ""He delivered something better than rhetorical excitement -- he spoke the truth, which makes its own history and carries its own poetry,"" Packer added. But it was not just traditional bloggers who were giving their two cents worth. Social network sites were also buzzing with the excitement of the occasion. CNN.com provided a live video streaming platform for Facebook users to interact with the inauguration ceremony by updating their status as they watched proceedings. Online viewers could choose between their friends or ""everyone watching,"" seeing live thoughts such as ""I've actually got shivers!"" to ""Barack H.? What a copout!"" Many were captivated by Aretha Franklin's eye-catching hat, with comments ranging from: ""Now that's a hat,"" to ""Aretha is wearing the hell outtta that hat."" There was also no escaping the ubiquitous ""Tweeple"" (Twitter people) posting 'tweets' on everything from their opinion of the inaugural speech to their celebrity spots. One 'tweeter' even blogged about using the VIP toilets at the inauguration site in Washington, saying: ""Just used the VIP porta potty. Contrary to what they might tell you, fancy people's **** does indeed stink."" More than 40,000 photos of the events on Capitol Hill tagged with the word ""inauguration"" were also posted to the photo-sharing site, Flickr. No aspect of the inauguration was left undissected, but Pastor Rick Warren's invocation prayer proved a hot topic amongst bloggers, who by turns criticized him for being too inclusive and not inclusive enough. Warren attracted some criticism for using words from the Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy texts as well as including the name of Jesus -- in several languages including Hebrew. However Dan Gilgoff, the ""God & Country"" blogger for U.S. News & World Report, acknowledged the difficult position Warren faced when he wrote: . ""For me, the two most salient features of the Rev. Rick Warren's inauguration invocation were its emphasis on the values of unity and mutual respect, which seemed partly a reaction to the controversy his selection as invocation speaker sparked, and its bold invocation of Jesus in the form of the Lord's Prayer. ""For some, those two themes would seem incongruous. It was trademark Warren, who -- like Barack Obama -- has been accused of trying to be all things to all people."" For some, it was about looking ahead to how long the adulation for President Obama would last. Conservative blogger Dr. Melissa Clouthier, who was liveblogging the inauguration, debated that the ""Obasm"" would last 4 years. ""His voters voted for him not for his ideas,"" she wrote. ""He didn't really articulate specific plans. He just gave vague promises. Voters were so enamored with the idea of him and he'll be around for four years, so the love will continue. ""The Press and the voters, too, imbued Obama with so much wonderfulness that to turn on him is to turn on their own perfect judgment. Since the vote was essentially narcissistic and people don't hate themselves, Obama will be loved for a good long time."" It remains to be seen whether her prediction will come true.",0.7444068,3455
37,"(CNN) -- Newspaper front pages around the world were unanimous Wednesday in celebrating the momentousness of Barack Obama's inauguration as U.S. President. Readers browse newspapers Wednesday in the Philippines. ""Let's rebuild America,"" said the front page of France's Le Figaro, over a photograph of a smiling Obama swearing the oath of office. ""The Promise,"" said Liberation, hailing the ""United States of Obama."" ""Remaking America,"" said the Daily Telegraph in the UK -- a theme carried by many other newspapers worldwide -- while the Daily Mirror preferred: ""Reborn in the USA."" The Sun showed a picture of Obama's seven-year-old daughter Sasha giving her father the thumbs-up with the headline: ""You're the Daddy."" ""At last it was the day, the hour, even the second that millions of Americans, ""and not just Americans, have waited for impatiently ever since November, and in many cases for much longer than that. The crowds in Washington were extraordinary evidence of the momentous public potency of the moment,"" the Guardian gushed in its editorial. Many international newspapers focused on the powerful symbolism and unifying power of the arrival of an African-American U.S. president on the world stage. ""We're a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers,"" said the headline on the front of the Times of India, taking a line from Obama's inaugural address. Japan's Asahi Shimbun said: ""He is expected to play the leading role in changing the world in which racial and religious confrontations continue to rage in defiance of the ideal expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" ""He is as much symbol as substance, an icon for the youth and a sign of deliverance for an older generation that never believed a man with his skin color would ascend those steps,"" said the International Herald Tribune. But many papers urged Obama to get to work immediately to address the urgent problems already piled up up in his intray. ""This wasn't the occasion for his most soaring of speeches. It was instead an oration rooted in the immediate challenges. It was directed at two audiences: a hopeful but anxious one at home, and an uncertain but hopeful one overseas, the UK's Times said. Speaking of the economic problems on a scale not seen since the Great Depression, China's Xinhua said: ""Like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, Obama, the new president, will get a rare opportunity to leave a sweeping and long-lasting imprint on the U.S. economy."" The Times of India called on Obama to continue the so-called ""war on terror"" by pursuing Pakistani-based militant groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba which New Delhi blames for last year's terror attacks in Mumbai. ""For the sake of the world's security, Obama must press Islamabad to clamp down on these groups and close down their bases, something that the Bush administration failed to do for most of its run."" Meanwhile, Germany's Der Spiegel sounded a note of caution about the weight of expectation now resting on Obama's shoulders: ""The catchword of the election campaign was 'change.'The new message to his followers is: 'Be patient.'"" And there was little lament for the passing of the presidency of Obama's controversial predecessor, President George W. Bush. ""He entered the White House promising to heal division by being a 'uniter, not a divider.' He leaves it today as one of the most divisive and least popular presidents in US history,"" the South China Morning Post said. For Obama, according to the UK's Independent, the challenge in office will be to strike a balance between the ""poetry"" of his campaign for election and the tough ""prose"" of government. ""Beautiful rhetoric alone cannot change the world. So perhaps the most encouraging aspect of the address was the new President's willingness to spell out the scale of the problems facing America and the ""hard choices"" that lie ahead for him and the country,"" the paper said. ""An old American aphorism has it that politicians campaign in poetry, but govern in prose. We can be sure that the poetry will continue to flow from an orator as gifted as President Obama. But now begins the difficult task of getting the prose right too.""",0.74356806,1565
38,"(CNN) -- A big part of being president is making decisions, and one of the key decisions a would-be president can make is who he or she marries. Cindy McCain has a master's degree in special education. She is part owner of her father's business. It's not like deciding whether to press the nuclear button, but first ladies in the United States can wield enormous influence in politics and in society. They're not elected. They're not paid. There's no precise job description. But whether it's an elegantly dressed Jacqueline Kennedy giving Americans a tour of the White House, Eleanor Roosevelt speaking on civil rights or Hillary Clinton saying ""I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies,"" first ladies are praised, criticized, adored and scorned -- but never ignored. The two women poised for the job, 54-year-old Cindy McCain, wife of Republican Sen. John McCain, and 44-year-old Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, come from strikingly different backgrounds.  Watch the different styles of potential first ladies » . McCain is the only child of a wealthy Arizona businessman, James Hensley, founder of Hensley & Co., a major distributor of Budweiser beer. Her stake in the business is estimated to be at least $100 million. She refused to release her full tax returns, saying ""I am not the candidate,"" but later provided summary pages of her 2006 taxes without details. Cindy McCain has a master's degree in special education. She met John McCain in 1979 when he was the U.S. Navy's liaison to the Senate. He was 18 years older than she. He divorced his wife and married Cindy in 1980. The McCains have four children, including a daughter adopted from an orphanage in Bangladesh. A tall, striking blonde with blue eyes, Cindy McCain has had health issues including a near-fatal stroke in 2004 and a battle with prescription drugs that she says is behind her. In an interview with CNN, McCain said her priority in life is charity. ""I've been internationally involved in many, many things,"" she said. ""Land mine removal, children's health care, poverty around the world -- and I will continue that."" On the campaign trail, always dressed impeccably, she stays ""on message"" but did take a swipe at Michelle Obama after her statement, ""For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country."" ""I don't know about you,"" McCain said in February, ""...I'm very proud of my country."" Michelle Obama has a blunt style and a wry, quirky sense of humor that goes over well with supporters. She doesn't mince words. In an interview with CNN, she said, ""I think race is always -- still, in this country, it's always on the table."" Michelle Obama was raised in a working-class family in Chicago, Illinois, but educated at some of America's elite universities: Princeton and Harvard Law School. She was hired by a top-flight law firm in Chicago and met Barack Obama when she was assigned to mentor him. They married in 1992 and have two young daughters. Michelle Obama cuts an impressive figure -- tall, slim and dressed in Jackie-Kennedy-like sheath dresses. If her husband is elected, she will make history as the first African-American first lady. She has given insights into her husband's domestic behavior: He doesn't pick up his socks. Cindy McCain praises her husband as a fighter who won't give up. Will we learn more of substance? Their husbands offer starkly different views of what they would do in office and Americans often look to their first ladies as a window into the thinking of the president.

39,"Editor's note: CNN's Ed Henry traveled with Barack Obama to Europe on the his first overseas trip as president. President Obama speaks during a news conference after the G-20 summit in London, England, on April 2. ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- One of the most revealing moments of President Obama's European tour came early in the trip at the close of the G-20 summit in London, England, where expectations were sky high for the new guy. He had just scored some victories on the financial crisis, while also taking some lumps. And now he had to face the media. Pushed by a reporter on why he couldn't get more done, the president was ready with a comeback about how it was far easier for American and British leaders to get their way at summits in years gone by. ""Well, if there's just Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's a -- that's an easier negotiation,"" the president said to laughter from reporters. ""But that's not the world we live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in."" In two simple sentences, the president accomplished a lot. In the first sentence, he made a fair point about how no U.S. president -- Barack Obama or George W. Bush -- can simply wave a magic wand and get the world to follow his lead. And in the second, with the line about how ""it shouldn't be the world that we live in,"" he was trying to send a signal to Europe that he's not planning to bully them. Again and again, Obama said he was here to listen and learn -- not to lecture colleagues such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Left unsaid, since it was plain enough to see, was what Obama was really saying: I'm not President Bush. That was clearly Obama's biggest accomplishment on this trip. He was able to effectively press that reset button administration officials have been talking about in order to make the case that traditional U.S. allies should come back into the fold, and it seemed to work. I remember sitting in the front row during a news conference at a palace in France to hear Sarkozy positively gush, ""And it feels really good to be able to work with a U.S. president who wants to change the world and who understands that the world does not boil down to simply American frontiers and borders. And that is a hell of a good piece of news for 2009."" Those are the style points where Obama clearly scored, and not just with European leaders. A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 79 percent of Americans surveyed feel that Obama has had a ""more positive"" effect on how people in other countries view the U.S. Only 19 percent of those surveyed thought he's had a ""more negative"" effect. The much tougher question is on substance, and whether Obama was able to capitalize on those warm feelings to accomplish what he set out to do before this trip. On that he basically has an incomplete because the early record here in Europe has been mixed. At the London summit, the president pushed for big money to be pumped into the world economy, and the leaders responded with $1.1 trillion. But that money is being directed to the International Monetary Fund to help developing countries, not pumped into the large economies to stimulate growth as U.S. officials had hoped. And Obama was also able to help prevent Sarkozy and others from getting a global supercop to oversee markets across all borders, a bit of a victory in his effort to make sure new regulations do not go too far. Perhaps the biggest victory came on the sidelines of the G-20 and had nothing to do with the financial crisis. Obama had his first face-to-face with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and they seemed to thaw those recently icy relations. Most important, is the two men agreed to begin intense negotiations to drastically reduce each side's nuclear stockpiles. This could be a dramatic step forward for world peace, so pay close attention to this development. But a cautionary note: There's a lot of heavy lifting left before this becomes a reality, and we may not know until Obama's visit to Moscow in July whether or not this deal has legs. At the NATO summit in France and Germany, the president was hoping to get a boost in resources for the war in Afghanistan. He did get allies to cough up about 5,000 troops, but in the form of police and security trainers -- not combat troops. So with Obama already committing 21,000 more U.S. troops to the mission, this is a very U.S.-heavy effort, something to keep a close eye on in the days ahead. In Prague, Czech Republic, at the European Union summit, Obama delivered a speech about nuclear nonproliferation to more than 20,000 people -- a boisterous crowd reminiscent of the campaign. He even used the old line ""yes we can"" to answer critics who think he can't follow through on ridding the world of nuclear weapons. But the most important moment of that stop in the tour came a few hours before the speech. It was when the infamous 3 a.m. phone call that Hillary Clinton talked about in the campaign finally arrived. Except it came at 4:30 a.m., when spokesman Robert Gibbs woke the president with the news that North Korea had tested a missile. He basically passed the test of his first international crisis (with -- ahem -- Secretary of State Clinton at his side, no less), although so far the administration has gotten nowhere at the United Nations despite a clear case against North Korea. Welcome to the U.N., sir. And finally, in Turkey the president officially began his outreach to try and repair the U.S. image in the Muslim world. Most interesting is that he got personal, alluding to the fact that he grew up in Indonesia and his father was Muslim -- politically risky given that last year he spent so much time having to deny false rumors that he's Muslim. ""The United States has been enriched by Muslim-Americans,"" Obama said. ""Many other Americans have Muslims in their family, or have lived in a Muslim-majority country -- I know, because I am one of them."" The speech was very well-received in this Muslim-majority nation. But it will take far more than one speech to fix tensions flared by everything from the war to Iraq to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay. In all, that's a hefty agenda to confront in just eight days abroad. It's no surprise then that I've noticed the president has been looking very tired on this trip. One aide told me that Obama was planning to go out for a nice unofficial dinner with first lady Michelle Obama in Prague on Saturday night but it was canceled because they simply needed some sleep. The fatigue has been complicated by the fact that Obama has been battling a nasty cold, telling aides he feels like he's got an ""acorn up my nose"" -- an interesting turn of phrase I had never heard before but seems to mean the president is stuffed up. And that brings me back to that brandy Roosevelt and Churchill shared decades ago. Obama made a legitimate claim about the difficulty of calling the shots in the current global environment, where small and mid-sized countries hold more sway than before. But right now all I can focus on is the brandy itself. After eight long days on the road, and very little sleep, I'm pretty ragged, too. That sounds like a pretty good way to cap things off.",0.73859614,2391
40,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice invited the woman set to replace her as the nation's top diplomat, Sen. Hillary Clinton, to dinner Monday night, a State Department spokesman said. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, left, and Sen. Hillary Clinton dined together Monday night. The dinner took place at Rice's home in the Watergate complex in downtown Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. The meeting lasted for two hours, he said. ""They talked just very generally about policy -- the challenges, the opportunities -- talked a little bit about the job of secretary of state, talked about the 'building,' managing a big operation,"" McCormack said. The two dined after Clinton met with members of President-elect Barack Obama's State Department transition team on Monday. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that important information often is exchanged during such dinners between outgoing and incoming secretaries of state. Albright, who was former President Bill Clinton's top diplomat during his second term, said she had a similar dinner with Colin Powell, President Bush's first secretary of state, in 2001.  Watch Albright give her advice to Obama » . ""I'm sure they had a social part of it, but Secretary Rice told her what the major challenges are, how the department works -- we call it 'the building' -- and, generally, I think they are very nice times,"" Albright said. ""It's just a matter of really turning over the most important job in the world on foreign policy,"" she added. Albright said Clinton will have to get up to speed on a number of issues, including the status of negotiations the U.S. is engaged in, who will be part of her team and how she will work with other members of Obama's national security team. ""I know from talking to her that she has a great sense of excitement and desire to ... reintroduce America to the rest of the world,"" said Albright, who said she thought that Clinton would be ""a very great secretary of state."" Earlier, Rice said she was looking forward to meeting her successor and said she believes Clinton will do ""a great job."" ""I talked with her and we're going to sit down, and I'm really looking forward to it. I've known her a long time, and she is someone that I admire,"" Rice told CNN on Sunday. Despite being from different parties -- and Clinton's tough criticism of Bush's foreign policy while she was a Democratic presidential candidate -- Rice has been effusive in her praise of the former first lady. ""President-elect Obama has made his choice, and he's made a terrific choice. Hillary Clinton is somebody of intelligence, and she'll do a great job,"" Rice told ABC News on Sunday. ""She also has what's most important to being secretary of state, and that is that you love this country, and you represent it from a basis of faith in its values. And I know that she will do that,"" Rice added. Obama's decision to tap Clinton as his top diplomat already has brought about changes. On Tuesday, former President Clinton released the corporate sponsors of a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in Hong Kong, a practice he previously has resisted. The sponsors of last week's meeting included CLSA, Laureate, the Roberson Foundation, Citi, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, The Economist, HP, Ogilvy, Suzlon, Thomson Reuters and CNN. The former president agreed to make it a regular practice to disclose the sponsors of his global initiative as part of a deal with the Obama transition team to allow the nomination of his wife to go forward. He also has agreed to allow State Department officials to review his speeches and other personal activities.",0.73630714,1452
41,"Washington (CNN)  -- Desiree Rogers, the White House social secretary, plans to step down, the Obama administration announced Friday. Her office came under scrutiny after a couple who lacked an invitation were allowed into President Obama's first state dinner. ""We are enormously grateful to Desiree Rogers for the terrific job she's done as the White House social secretary,"" the president and first lady said in a statement released Friday. In an interview on Friday, Rogers said she was leaving voluntarily and that her decision was unrelated to the fallout over the security breach. ""It has nothing to do with that,"" she said. ""It's Secret Service's job to handle security. Not the social secretary's office."" The Obamas' statement did not mention November's party-crashing incident . ""When she took this position, we asked Desiree to help make sure that the White House truly is the people's house, and she did that by welcoming scores of everyday Americans through its doors, from wounded warriors to local schoolchildren to NASCAR drivers. ""She organized hundreds of fun and creative events during her time here, and we will miss her. We thank her again for her service and wish her all the best in her future endeavors."" Rogers said in an e-mail to CNN on Friday, ""It has been incredible setting the foundation for the [White House] for this historical presidency. Headed back to private sector."" ""I accomplished initially what I came to do,"" Rogers said later. ""I like strategy. I like building something. It's built... the foundation of the [social secretary's] office is good and solid."" Rogers would not say where she'll be working. She said she'll be ""around to work on the transition"" to a new social secretary at the White House. She summed up her experiences at the White House in another note: ""330 events. Halloween for 3,000. Easter egg roll for 30,000. Music series with performances and the performers teaching the students during the day. Latin, jazz, country, civil rights. "" In December, the White House was accused of stonewalling as Congress investigated the party-crasher security breach at Obama's first state dinner. At issue was whether the White House was protecting Rogers from testifying about how Tareq and Michaele Salahi were able to crash the first White House state dinner. The couple did not have an invite but were allowed in. Rogers' office planned the dinner. At the time, Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said his agency would take the heat for the incident. ""This is our fault and our fault alone,"" he told federal lawmakers. ""There's no other people to blame here. ... Look at me and blame me,"" he told members of the House Homeland Security Committee.

42,"(CNN) -- Millions of people are expected to go to Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, but with a troubled economy and pocketbook issues on the mind, the president-elect must be careful to set the right tone. Construction of the inaugural stand continues in front of the White House last week. President Bush raised a record $42.8 million dollars for his second inauguration, and according to Public Citizen, more than 90 percent of the donations to that ceremony were from executives or corporations. But this year, some say throwing a multimillion-dollar party would be unseemly in a time when crash, bailout, and foreclosure fill the economic headlines. ""A lot of it is about tone and making sure that the celebrations that do take place are not over the top, that they don't appear to be insensitive to the pain people have right now,"" said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The inaugural committee for Obama and Vice President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to make sure the ceremony underscores the incoming administration's ""commitment to change business as usual in Washington."" The Presidential Inaugural Committee has limited individual contributions to $50,000. There is no law restricting the size of donations, but in the past, inaugural committees  have set contribution limits as high as $250,000. The PIC said it will not take contributions from corporations, political action committees, current federally registered lobbyists, non-U.S. citizens or registered foreign agents. Obama has promised to ""take power away from the corporate lobbyists"" -- a pledge that would be questioned should the president-elect rely on them to foot his inauguration bill. ""If he can pay for these parties with small donations, I think there'd be a lot more acceptance of that,"" Alexander said. Watchdog groups say there are some things Obama can do to take control of the tone. For example, he could make donations to charity, and Michelle Obama could opt for something more reasonably priced than a designer dress. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, he also faced a financial crisis. He gave voters a now famous pep talk about the failing economy, then skipped the fancy inaugural balls because they sent the wrong message. But analysts say Obama's not expected to go that far because so many people want to celebrate his historic win. ""Washington, D.C., was pro-Obama and had Obama-mania long before November 4. But the moment November 4 occurred, all -- all craziness sort of broke loose,"" said Anne Schroeder Mullini, a gossip columnist for Politico. As inauguration organizers work to keep the tone in check, they are speaking out against those trying to make money by scalping tickets to the event. Tickets for the inauguration are distributed through members of Congress, and just 240,000 seats are available for the actual swearing-in ceremony. The tickets are supposed to be free, but with demand outpacing supply, a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace. Legitimate ticket brokers -- the same companies that peddle tickets to rock concerts and NASCAR races -- are selling tickets to the inauguration for thousands of dollars, even for standing-room areas on the National Mall. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wants to make that practice a crime, punishable by up to a year in prison. Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the ceremony. ""We think it's absolutely insane to be selling those tickets. We understand some people want to make a buck, but for those people thinking of buying tickets, it's buyer beware,"" warned Howard Gantman, staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.

44,"(CNN) -- When travel author Beth Whitman was in Vietnam, she witnessed a group of young American male travelers rough-housing in the streets outside of the Rex Hotel. Americans traveling to sites around the world like the Blue Mosque in Istanbul should be respectful. In their youthful, loud exuberance, they ended up ripping each other's shirts as they horsed around. ""I thought to myself that those shirts probably cost maybe 20, 30, 40 dollars apiece, and here you are in a culture where the people may not be even making that much on a monthly basis. ""It's that sort of thing, just not being aware how off-putting that can be to the local culture."" Such behavior, while seemingly harmless, can help to cement the moniker of ""the ugly American,"" which came to refer to loud, rude and thoughtless behavior of U.S. citizens abroad. The term came about as a result of the book ""The Ugly American,"" and more than 50 years after its publication, those from the United States continue to battle an image of arrogance and nationalism. Written by William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick, the novel chronicled American foreign policy and diplomacy failures in a fictitious developing nation. In the book, the American ambassador to the country is portrayed as crude and inept. That enduring legacy has not been easy to shake, and even the U.S. president knows the score. During a recent trek to Turkey, President Obama said in his remarks at the Tophane Cultural Center in Istanbul that he knows the ""stereotypes of the United States are out there."" ""Sometimes it suggests that America has become selfish and crass, or that we don't care about the world beyond us,"" he said. ""And I'm here to tell you that that's not the country that I know and it's not the country that I love."" Whitman, the author of the ""Wanderlust and Lipstick"" guides and publisher of ""Traveling with Kids,"" often gives lectures and workshops -- many geared toward female travelers -- and speaks on the importance of Americans being stellar representatives of their homeland while abroad. ""It's about being respectful of the country and the culture, treating the people respectfully and not flashing around your money and your material possessions,"" Whitman said. ""It's up to every individual to be that ambassador and portray their country well."" Author Ann Hulbert wrote a piece for The New York Times Magazine a few years ago about her desire not to be mistaken for an ugly American when her family traveled to Istanbul and the Turkish coast. Hulbert took the step of vetoing one of her teenage son's T-shirts, worried that the message on it, ""The Fighting Quakers. Beat them 'til they reach consensus,"" might be misunderstood in the Muslim country. ""I think that when you are a big and powerful country, it's easy for the rest of the world to feel that you don't deal with the kind of consideration and humility that other people do,"" said Hulbert, who researches the areas she visits prior to her trips. iReport.com: Ever been to the Netherlands?

Standing in the lobby with one of the hotel's executives, he witnessed a man, dripping wet from the pool and wrapped in a towel, emerge from the elevator. The man walked through the bar, down the stairs and into the marble lobby just as the staff tried to intercept him, Baker said.

Farley runs the site What Manners Most and said Americans tend to be seen as free-spirited and not nearly as guarded as natives of some of the other countries -- as evidenced most recently by first lady Michelle Obama putting her arm around Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. ""That's something that maybe sent shivers up the spine of a lot Britons, but in the final analysis, people really looked at that as a nice gesture and something very American to do,"" said Farley, who added that travelers should be as respectful in other countries as they would be if they were in someone else's home. The Obamas may actually be aiding in changing the perception themselves. Travel writer Beth Whitman said the mere election of President Obama has helped to improve America's reputation worldwide. ""It helped to change how we are viewed, but the real key is the behavior once a person arrives in a country,"" Whitman said. ""Some of [the ugly American perception] will exist no matter who is in office, and that's why everyone has to take responsibility for being the very best representative of their country that they can.""",0.7277289,2855
45,"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's daughters are moving into a house with a swimming pool, a bowling alley and its own movie theater. Sasha Obama, left, and Malia Obama will make the White House home come January 20. When their father is inaugurated on January 20, Malia Obama, 10, and Sasha Obama, 7, will also be moving into a place where they'll not only be under the watchful eye of the Secret Service but also under the eye of the media. ""One of the negatives of the White House is that its very much a fishbowl,"" presidential historian Doug Wead said. ""There's something that Sasha or Malia will say or do and they'll be remembered for it for the rest of their lives,"" said Wead, who wrote ""All the Presidents' Children,"" a book on the lives of kids at the White House.  Watch what life's like for White House kids » . Theodore Roosevelt's children used to like to drop water balloons on foreign dignitaries, Wead said. They also let their pet snake slither around the White House dining room. John F. Kennedy Jr. was known for hiding under his father's Oval Office desk. His older sister, Caroline, had a pony who romped untethered around the White House grounds. President Abraham Lincoln's youngest son, Thomas, used to startle everyone in the building by making all the White House bells ring at one time. But with the mischief and pranks comes a lifetime of pressure, said Noah McCollough, who wrote the book ""First Kids."" ""John Quincy Adams' kids went through alcoholism and addiction because they couldn't live up to their parents expectation"" in their later years, McCollough said.  Read up on the blessed and star-crossed lives of some other White House kids » . Much of Malia and Sasha's White House experience will be monitored by their mother, Michelle Obama, who seems determined to be active in their lives. Even as her husband campaigned for the presidency, Michelle Obama was a soccer mom, cheering from the sidelines of her daughters' games. ""I'm a mother first. And I'm going to be at parent-teacher conferences, and ... I'm going to be at the things that they want me to attend. I'm not going to miss a ballet recital,"" Michelle Obama said. Together with the president-elect, she'll have to decide where the girls will attend school. ""If they send their child to a private school they'll be called elitist for betraying the public school system,"" Wead said. Jacqueline Kennedy, not wanting Caroline being hounded by the media as she went to school, set up a first-grade classroom on the third floor of the White House. Ten of Caroline's friends also attended, each bringing their own lunch pail. President Jimmy Carter sent daughter Amy, age 9 when she moved to Washington, to the public Hardy Middle School. President Bill Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, attended the private Sidwell Friends School. No matter the choice, even their grades will come under public scrutiny. ""If you flunk that huge math test, it's on the front page of the newspaper the next day,"" McCollough said. But assuming no one gets grounded for bad grades, imagine the possibilities for sleepovers or parties. President Gerald Ford's daughter Susan, for example, held her senior prom at the White House. Whatever the educational choice, the Obamas have made clear their kids won't be an afterthought now that Barack Obama is about to become the world's most powerful person. On Friday morning, before the president-elect met with his advisers on the troubled economy and before his first news conference since the election scheduled for the afternoon, Barack and Michelle Obama went to a parent-teacher conference at the University of Chicago Lab School.

46,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- CNN White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux has covered the Bush administration for six years. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux shares a light moment with President Bush during his final press conference Monday. As always, she was in the room Monday when Bush held his final press conference, an almost hourlong event in which the president answered questions about current issues and reflected on his eight years in office. Here Malveaux reflects on her time covering the Bush administration and on the final White House press conference, which she described as ""raw,"" ""fascinating"" and ""bizarre."" Q: How do you compare this to previous briefings? Malveaux: This was an extraordinary press conference. It took the president a little time to warm up. He called on me third. About two questions after that, he embraced this different kind of mood and revealed things about himself that he didn't before.  Watch Bush talk about his respect for the press » . We'd heard a bit about his misgivings before, but we didn't expect to hear about his disappointments -- ""Sometimes the biggest disappointments will come from your so-called friends."" At times he looked directly at me, other times away, in flashes of rage. And occasionally he turned to all of us pleading with an expression for understanding, empathy. He raised his voice when it was suggested that he was alone, insisting that he never felt the burden of the office: ""I believe this -- the phrase 'burdens of the office' is overstated,"" he said. But at other points he reflected on the weight of the job: ""You never escape the presidency. It travels with you wherever you go."" When he was discussing Iraq, he was almost yelling, defending his administration. He was using gestures, leaning forward on the podium, his finger raised in the air. It was dramatic. Q: What was it like in the room? A: You saw at times a defiant President Bush as well as ultimately reflective in some ways. We know he regretted the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner on the aircraft carrier. But we heard some new details about how he had some regrets that Air Force One flew over New Orleans at that critical time when the city was under water during Katrina, as opposed to landing. He said he was wary of taking away law enforcement and rescue resources on the ground. But later in the press conference he was defiant about Hurricane Katrina, telling us: ""Don't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed.""  Watch Bush defend the response to Katrina » . It was from there the president shifted to the president-elect. He discussed the fact that many people never thought they'd see the day when a black man would become the president, and it spoke volumes about the progress the country's made with race. At that time, he seemed misty-eyed. Q: Were you surprised at how candid the president was? A: This is certainly the most open he has been about some of the failures of his administration. You know, what was interesting, he took us back to the time of September 11 in a very emotional and strident way. He said -- remember those times when they had those tough questions, why didn't you put the dots together? It was almost as if he felt like he couldn't win either way. But at the same time, he said self-pity was pathetic and it wasn't something he was going to engage in. It was a very interesting look at President Bush grappling with all of these different things -- the successes as well as the failures. You get a sense here that he is looking at his legacy, that he's trying to come to terms with some of the things he did, his role in all of this. Q: Was there any one moment that stood out to you? A: He was most defiant when he talked about what he believes are the threats, potential threats against the United States. You could see him becoming emotional -- that this is something the future president is going to have to deal with, that he is going to have face. Every single time he went back to the threat out there, it seemed he wanted to reveal more, and would wish Barack Obama the best. At times, Bush seemed to be speaking directly to the president-elect: ""He'll get in the Oval Office, and there will be a lot of people that are real critical and harsh, and he'll be disappointed at times by the tone of the rhetoric.""  Watch how Bush and Obama are working out the shift of power » . Q: The president ribbed you about the pronunciation of your name because it's French, even jokingly saying you can call him ""Georges."" But he finally got your name right. A: Yes, you could say the president and I have had an ongoing standoff for years now. When I first met the president, he called me Suzanne [said: Sue-zan], and I initially corrected him: ""It's Suzanne. Rhymes with John."" The president would blame it on his Texas accent. Actually, the first time he got it right was years ago on a trip to India and Pakistan. I remember feeling shocked. Sometimes I thought he intentionally called me ""Sue-zan,"" if he was angry with my questions. Q: Any other surprises about this press conference? A: He didn't call on Helen Thomas, who is widely viewed as the dean of the White House press corps. She's been critical of President Bush and been covering presidents since Kennedy. She was out there, front row center with her hand raised.",0.7241662,1591
47,"(CNN) -- Seth MacFarlane: Sarah Palin expressed outrage at a Fox television program, created by MacFarlane, for joking about people with Down syndrome and making an apparent reference to her 22-month-old son, Trig, who has the genetic disorder. The former Alaska governor said on her Facebook page that she was too angry to offer a coherent response, so she had her daughter Bristol release a full statement on the family's behalf. The Palins directed their criticism at the prime-time Fox cartoon, ""Family Guy."" In Sunday's episode, a teenaged female character with Down syndrome told another character that ""my mom is the former governor of Alaska."" A song and dance routine by another character also used language that ridiculed people with disabilities. According to the show's Web site, ""Family Guy"" earned an Emmy nomination in 2009 for Outstanding Comedy Series, ""only the second animated series in television history to be honored with such distinction."" On the show, MacFarlane performs the voices of the father, Peter Griffin, and his 1-year-old son, Stewie, who is, the Fox Web site reports, ""a diabolically clever baby whose heterosexuality is hanging by a thread."" MacFarlane is also the voice of the intellectually superior family dog. The Web site Seth McFarlane Unlimited reports that MacFarlane began drawing cartoons at the age of 2 and is the recipient of two honorary degrees. While receiving the one from Harvard in 2006, he delivered the Class Day Speech playing the roles of several of the characters from ""Family Guy.""

Dalai Lama: The Tibetan spiritual leader is on his way to the United States for a number of speaking engagements and is scheduled to meet with President Obama on Thursday, even though China has warned that such a meeting would harm ties between it and the United States, a White House spokesman said on February 2. ""The president told China's leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the Dalai Lama, and he intends to do so,"" Bill Burton told reporters earlier this month. China warned that ties between two of the world's superpowers would be strained if Obama met with the Dalai Lama. ""It will seriously undermine the foundation of Sino-U.S. political relations,"" said Zhu Weiqun, a Communist Party official who is in charge of talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama. Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of advocating for Tibetan independence from China. In explaining Obama's intention to hold the meeting, Burton said the Dalai Lama ""is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader, and the president will meet with him in that capacity."" Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, but the Dalai Lama and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the most numerous ethnic group in China. Zhu said there would be no compromise on China's control of Tibet. The 14th Dalai Lama was born in July 1935. According to his official biography, the child named Lhamo Dhondup at that time was recognized at the age of 2 as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama. He went through years of monastic training and assumed political power in 1950, a year after China's invasion. The Dalai Lama ultimately fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He lives in exile in the north Indian town of Dharamsala.

Jesse Sullivan: The 25-year-old from Petersburg, Illinois, has been living for two weeks at the corner of Florida and North Capitol Avenues in Washington. He's been living there in a tent to show solidarity with Haitian families in crisis, he says, and to remind people that emergency shelter is still sorely needed for victims of the January 12 earthquake. When CNN reached him by phone in his tent Tuesday, he explained that he was recently in Washington to figure out how to work in Afghanistan, but realized that the situation in Haiti was a more pressing need. So he went to the Haitian Embassy to volunteer in any way he could. He says a minister at the embassy came up with the official-sounding title ""special assistant to the Haitian Embassy for relief and reconstruction,"" which Sullivan now uses informally. When he passed a nearby statue of the Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi, Sullivan read the inscription, ""My Life is My Message,"" and the idea of staying in the tent came to him. Sullivan, who has a master's degree in global governance and diplomacy from The University of Oxford in England, says he plans to live in the tent for at least one month. ""If I can still be effective, I'll stay there for a year."" The tent is pitched in the private parking lot of a pizza restaurant with the permission of its owner. Sullivan told CNN, ""The police stop by to make sure I'm OK and not too crazy."" He says his parents are a bit concerned, yet somewhat relieved. ""My initial plan was to head to Afghanistan, but for my dad and mom, anything that's not Afghanistan makes them pretty happy."" Next week, Sullivan plans to hold a news conference at his tent to announce his ""Live for Haiti"" campaign. He said, ""It's not about us saving Haiti. This crisis has the opportunity that Haiti is going to save us from a narrow American dream -- one that doesn't recognize that we are connected to people around the world."" Live for Haiti .

Wurzelbacher, who gained notoriety during the last presidential campaign as ""Joe the Plumber,"" spoke this past weekend in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at an event on behalf of state Rep. Sam Roher, who is running for governor. Scott Detrow of Pennsylvania's Public Radio Capitol News reports that Wurzelbacher told him that more than 200 politicians wanted his support, but he's backed only five so far. He's now supporting grass-roots Tea Party movements. During his speech, Wurzelbacher said he doesn't support Sarah Palin any more because the former Alaska governor is backing Sen. John McCain's re-election effort. ""John McCain is no public servant,"" he told the room, calling McCain a career politician. When Detrow pointed out that without McCain, he'd just be plain old Sam Wurzelbacher of Ohio -- Joe the Plumber wouldn't exist -- his response was, ""I don't owe him s---. He really screwed my life up, is how I look at it."" Wurzelbacher told the reporter, ""McCain was trying to use me. I happened to be the face of Middle Americans. It was a ploy."" Wurzelbacher first gained fame in 2008 when he told candidate Barack Obama that he was worried that rolling back President Bush's tax breaks would prevent him from buying a plumbing company that would earn between $250,000 and $280,000 a year.

48,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday admitted he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Tom Daschle as his health and human services secretary, saying Daschle's tax problems sent a message that the politically powerful are treated differently from average people. President Barack Obama is interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, withdrew earlier Tuesday as news that he failed to pay some taxes in the past continued to stir opposition on Capitol Hill. ""I think I screwed up,"" Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again."" Daschle had apologized Monday for what he said were honest mistakes, calling them an embarrassment. The series of errors included improperly reporting $15,000 in charitable donations, failing to list $80,000 in lobbying income due to what Daschle said was a paperwork error, and not reporting as income a car and driver loaned to him by a friend and business associate.  Watch Obama admit mistake » . Daschle recently filed amended tax returns and paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005 to 2007. Those tax issues, as well as questions over whether work he did after his stint in the Senate amounted to lobbying, gave critics ammunition to question Obama's call for a change of culture in Washington. ""Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics,"" Obama said. ""And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes.""

""He understands it as well as anybody, but also the politics, which is going to be required to actually get it done,"" Obama said. Earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs insisted Daschle's decision to withdraw was made on his own, not as a result of any prodding from the administration. In a written statement, Daschle acknowledged the political problem he had created for the administration. Still, Obama insisted the mistake was his.  Read how CNN analysts assess the situation » .

""Look, the only measure of my success as president when people look back five years from now or nine years from now is going to be, did I get this economy fixed.

Cooper also asked Obama about reports that he is not using former President Bush's phrase, ""war on terror,"" to refer to the wars in Iraq in Afghanistan. ""Words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds,"" Obama said.

50,"Editor's note: Peggy Wallace Kennedy is the daughter of George C. Wallace and Lurleen Wallace, who both were governors of Alabama. She lives in Montgomery, Alabama, with her husband, Mark Kennedy, a retired state Supreme Court justice. They have two sons, Leigh, a decorated veteran of the Iraq war, and Burns, a college sophomore. Peggy Wallace Kennedy says her father sought absolution for his segregationist views. MONTGOMERY, Alabama (CNN) -- I heard a car door slam behind me and turned to see an elderly but spry woman heading my way. The night before, a gang of vandals had swept through the cemetery desecrating graves, crushing headstones and stealing funereal objects. My parents' graves, situated on a wind-swept hill overlooking the cemetery, had not been spared. A large marble urn that stood between two granite columns had been pried loose and spirited away, leaving faded silk flowers strewn on the ground. I was holding a bouquet of them in my arms when the woman walked up and gave me a crushing hug. ""Honey,"" she said, ""you don't know me, but when I saw you standing up here on this hill, I knew that you must be one of the girls and I couldn't help myself but to drive up here and let you know how much me and my whole family loved both of your parents. They were real special people."" I thanked her for her kind words as we stood side by side gazing down at the graves of Govs. George Wallace and Lurleen Wallace. After a few moments, the woman leaned into me and spoke almost in a conspiratorial whisper. ""I never thought I would live to see the day when a black would be running for president. I know your daddy must be rolling over in his grave."" Not having the heart or the energy to respond, I gave her bony arm a slight squeeze, turned and walked away. As I put the remnants of the graveyard spray in the trunk of my car, I assumed that she had not bothered to notice the Barack Obama sticker on my bumper. When I was a young voter and had little interest in politics, my father would mark my ballot for me. As I thought about the woman in the cemetery, I mused that if he were alive and I had made the same request for this election, there would be a substantial chance, though not a certainty, that he would put an ""X"" by Obama's name. Perhaps it would be the last chapter in his search for inner peace that became so important to him after becoming a victim of hatred and violence himself when he was shot and gravely injured in a Laurel, Maryland, shopping center parking lot. Perhaps it would be a way of reconciling in his own mind that what he once stood for did not prevent freedom of opportunity and self-advancement from coming full circle; his final absolution. George Wallace and other Southern governors of his ilk stood defiantly in the 1950s and '60s in support of racial segregation, a culture of repression, violence and denial of basic human rights. Their actions and the stark images of their consequences that spread across the world galvanized the nation and gave rise to a cry for an end to the American apartheid. The firestorms that were lit in Birmingham, Oxford, Memphis, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery, Little Rock and Selma were a call to arms to which the people responded. And now a new call to arms has sounded as Americans face another assault on freedom. For if the stand in the schoolhouse door was a defining moment for George Wallace, then surely the aftermath of Katrina and the invasion of Iraq will be the same for George W. Bush. The trampling of individual freedoms and his blatant contempt for the rights of the average American may not have been as obvious as an ax-handle-wielding governor, but Bush's insidiousness and piety have made him much more dangerous. Healing must come, hope will be our lodestar, humility will reshape the American conscience, and honesty in both word and deed will refresh and invigorate America, and having Barack Obama to lead will give us back our power to heal. My father lived long enough to come to an understanding of the injustices borne by his deeds and the legacy of suffering that they left behind. History will teach future generations that he was a man who used his political power to promote a philosophy of exclusion. As his daughter, who witnessed his suffering in the twilight of his years and who witnessed his deeds and heard his words, I am one who believes that the man who, on March 7, 1965, listened to the reports of brutality as they streamed into the Governor's Mansion from Selma, Alabama, was not the same man who, in March of 1995, was welcomed with open arms as he was rolled through a sea of African-American men, women and children who gathered with him to welcome another generation of marchers, retracing in honor and remembrance the historic steps from Selma to Montgomery. Four years ago, the young Illinois senator who spoke at the Democratic National Convention mesmerized me. I hoped even then that he would one day be my president. Today, Barack Obama is hope for a better tomorrow for all Americans. He stands on the shoulders of all those people who have incessantly prayed for a day when ""justice will run down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream"" (Amos 5:24). Perhaps one day, my two sons and I will have the opportunity to meet Barack Obama in person to express our gratitude to him for bringing our family full circle. And today, the day after the election, I am going to ride to the cemetery so that if asked, I can vouch for the fact that the world is still spinning but my father lies at peace.

51,"Editor's note: How would you rate President Obama's first 100 days? You'll get a chance to make your opinion known at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday on the CNN National Report Card. Supporters say President Obama is tackling an aggressive agenda, while critics say he's leaving Republicans behind. (CNN)  -- More than two years ago, a junior senator with presidential aspirations stood on the steps of Illinois' Old State Capitol in Springfield and warned of politicians who fail to live up to expectations. ""Too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own,"" then-Sen. Barack Obama said as he announced his intentions to pursue the Democratic nomination. Now, after 100 days in office, observers are asking the same of him: Has President Obama lived up to the expectations that candidate Obama created? ""What Obama has successfully done is keep his persona intact, which is a man of deep family values and a core moral center. And I think that people are learning to trust Obama that when he talks, he's not just articulate, but he's shooting straight,"" said presidential historian Doug Brinkley. Obama won the White House campaigning on a message of hope and a promise of change. As he emerged a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, he pushed an ambitious agenda, vowing to overhaul health care, education and energy policy. But as the severity of the economic meltdown took hold and Obama moved into the White House, his inspirational rhetoric was injected with a sobering dose of reality. Obama encouraged patience and cautioned that, ""change doesn't happen overnight."" In his first 100 days, Obama laid the groundwork for many of his campaign promises and faced criticism that he's trying to do too much. ""Nobody will ever be able to accuse him of being an idle man during his first 100 days,"" Brinkley said. ""He's clearly showing himself to be a progressive in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, with the moral core of Jimmy Carter."" So far Obama is showing himself to be ""the same guy that we had on the campaign trail,"" Brinkley said. Given the items on his agenda, Obama is living up to expectations, CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said. ""The public is patient and is not expecting to see a quick turnaround in the economy,"" he said. ""I count 10 major items -- jobs, health care, education, energy, housing, banks, automakers, deficit reduction, taxes and the war in Afghanistan. Plus, a pledge to take up immigration reform and climate change in the near future. Any one of those things would be a significant agenda,"" he said. But some Republicans say the president has failed when it comes to his pledge to reach across the aisle. After Democrats moved ahead with a $787 billion stimulus bill that garnered no Republican support in the House and just three Republican votes in the Senate, ""That's when it became clear to me that all of this post-partisan talk and working down the middle and working together was a ruse,"" said John Boehner, House minority leader. Obama's approval ratings remain high -- hovering around 65 percent. Those numbers are on par with where President Reagan and President Carter stood at this point in their presidencies. But one year later, their approval ratings dropped to about 40 percent. Obama has maintained his popularity, Republican strategist and CNN contributor Mary Matalin said, but he's lost support from Republicans and some independents ""because what he is not is what he was perceived to be in the campaign -- a centrist."" Schneider said Obama's agenda -- which includes massive government spending -- represents a challenge to the Republicans' core principle of smaller government. Republicans haven't responded to Obama's outreach, and ""it's causing serious political damage to their party, he said.  Watch: Is bipartisanship dead? » . Obama is not personally polarizing in part because he is cautious about divisive social issues, ""but his economic policies are very divisive,"" Schneider said. ""Obama is the mirror image of Bill Clinton ... Voters either loved him or hated him,"" he said, noting that after his first two years, Clinton's policies became more moderate and consensus driven. The National Republican Senatorial Committee last month released an ad accusing Obama of backpedaling on numerous campaign promises, calling him out for signing a spending bill with thousands of earmarks, mishandling the AIG bonus scandal and failing to rein in government spending. PolitiFact, a Web site that has been keeping track of Obama's campaign promises, reports that Obama has kept 27 promises, compromised on seven, broken six, stalled on three, has 67 in the works and has yet to take action on another 408. But one Republican who broke ranks to endorse Obama and also spoke at the Democratic convention says he's had no regrets. ""As president, in surprisingly short order, he has moved rather decisively to implement new directions,"" said former Iowa Rep. Jim Leach, who served as a Republican member of the House for 30 years. And on areas where Obama hasn't been 100 percent in line with his campaign promises -- such as softening his stance on NAFTA and slightly extending his timeline for troop withdrawal -- Leach said Obama is making adjustments ""in a very appropriately adaptive way."" ""It is inconceivable that a thinking individual can agree with the president or anyone in public office 100 percent of the time,"" he said, adding that he thinks Obama has some prospect of ""potentially going down as one of the great presidents in American history."" Rep. Lincoln Davis, D-Tennessee, who declined to endorse Obama before his party's convention, said Obama has met expectations thus far. ""I think every person who runs for office -- whether it's a local office, statewide office, runs for president -- we all have ideas, we all have visions, we all have a hope,"" Davis said. ""But then acting on those is sometimes more difficult than others. But I do believe the president, during the campaign, made his visions known ... and I think he has certainly lived up to those."" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins said if he were a Democrat, he might give Obama an ""A"" on his performance. ""I think the guy has had a great start. He's pushing an agenda that obviously he ran on. He's lived up to most of his promises. You know, he's a big personality, and I don't diminish that,"" he said. ""I think the country wants a president they feel comfortable with. A long, hard path ahead, and hopefully, some of the stuff he's thrown out there will work because we're spending a ton of taxpayers' money,""  he said, noting that as a Republican he gives Obama a ""B."" Brinkley said it's somewhat unfair to hold the president to a 100-day litmus test because ""it takes a while to get settled in."" ""He's doing a lot of bold things for as short a period of 100 days,"" he said, pointing specifically to Obama's economic bailouts. But, he said, there's the large caveat that only time will tell how these bold moves will play out.",0.7206852,3522
52,"Editor's note: Tara Wall is deputy editor for The Washington Times. Before joining the newspaper, she was a senior adviser for the Republican National Committee and was named a public affairs director in the Department of Health and Human Services by President Bush. Read her columns here. Tara Wall says President Bush will be remembered for keeping America safe. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In his final radio address as president-elect on the Sunday ahead of his inauguration, Barack Obama said President Bush ""extended the hand of cooperation"" to him throughout this period of transition. It was a final act of civility, on Mr. Bush's part. It is a trait that is not surprising to those who know Bush (or those paying some attention at least half of the time). At least one Democrat has given him credit for it. Unfortunately, that tone of civility has been lost on the Democratic leadership over the past eight years. Civility aside, how others -- more importantly, history -- will judge the 43rd president of the United States, is the question that has followed Bush out the door. Lucky for him, it won't just be up to Democrats to determine. ""I believe President Bush will be vindicated,"" said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in an interview a couple of weeks ago. She may be an ardent defender of Bush, but I believe she's right. She, like I, have a different vantage point than what has been routinely portrayed. While sitting in the Oval Office with the 43rd president, for what was his last official week in office last Thursday, I got the sense that he feels he will be vindicated, too. He won't say as much, directly, but indirectly points to what matters most in his eyes -- protecting the homeland. ""History will eventually see ... that not only was it necessary to take the steps I took, but [they] led to a better world,"" the president told me. On a personal level (and for the sake of full disclosure), I must say that I have had the pleasure of working for and knowing Bush from his first campaign for president and throughout his presidency. I started as a volunteer in 1999, then worked as a spokeswoman during his second campaign and then as an appointee in his administration. Not only have I counted it an honor and a privilege to serve the 43rd president, but I have always had a deep respect for him as a person of faith, his strident conviction in doing what was right for the country and his commitment to closing the disparities that exist between black and white Americans -- no matter the mistakes made and lessons learned. Above all, it is his dignity and civility that stand out to me most. Yet, for many conservatives (not just liberals), Bush has failed on many fronts. From the miscalculation of the insurgency in Iraq, to failed intelligence gathering and the issues of maintaining fiscal conservatism and delivering real immigration reform -- I can't tell you how many Republicans and conservatives I've spoken to over this past year who have told me how ""disappointed"" they've been with Bush. A few among them voted for ""change"" as a result. The legacy Bush leaves behind won't be everything he wanted (particularly as it relates to popularity), but on many fronts, it will be better than that of his predecessor. Bill Clinton may have been popular, but his moral failings brought shame on the office of the presidency and tainted the people's house. That will forever be a stain on Clinton's legacy. Not to mention, there was no such ""civility"" or ""cooperation"" when Clinton turned the keys over to Bush. I prefer principle over popularity any day. On the moral front, President Bush delivered. On the social front, he delivered. On the fiscal front he failed considerably. Yet, on the national security front and on many domestic policies, he succeeded. Depending on your vantage point, success may mean something wholly different. The details will be debated for decades to come. Among the many uncertainties, one thing is certain -- you can't judge history in the midst of it. Declaring one ""the worst"" president while he's still in office is an effort in rhetorical futility. Historians know this all too well. The best prediction one can make was summed up by presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin on ""Meet the Press"" last year: ""If Iraq became the model democracy or even just a democracy, and in doing so changed the whole complexion of the Middle East, then obviously that would be the legacy that would justify what Bush did and what our troops did."" And that's exactly what Mr. Bush is banking on. During my Oval Office interview with the president, I asked him to complete the sentence ""President Bush was... [fill in the blank]."" He responded (uncharacteristically in third person): ""President Bush was the president at a time when our nation was attacked, he clearly saw the dangers, he pursued the enemy, he put tools in place so the professionals could better protect the people, and the homeland was not attacked."" That is the legacy he wants. Popular or not, he kept America safe. And if nothing else, for that, he will be vindicated. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tara Wall.",0.7198108,3410

But her hope is giving way these days to a sense that some things never change. ""I trust his motives,"" she said of President Obama. ""I feel like he is an honorable guy, I am not sure if he can do it. That's the problem."" Too much too soon is one of her worries. Too much politics as usual is another. Add in too much bailout money and Kate O'Leary is more sober now than she was when Obama took the oath of office. Across from O'Leary sat Debbie Lurvey, who took a job at the Tilt'n Diner after losing her job in the mortgage business. ""It was a forced unemployment because of the economy,"" Lurvey said. ""So, you know, I decided that it was best to move on to something a little more stable."" O'Leary and Lurvey are among those who think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better. But our third guest for our weekly diner conversation, Jim Wells, isn't so sure. ""I think most of it is psychological,"" said Wells, a Republican who believes consumers need to be more confident. ""The secret out of a recession like this is to spend money. And you have got to spend your own, you can't expect somebody else to spend it for you."" He makes the distinction between consumer spending and what he sees as too much government spending. ""We are going to have to pay the bill in another two or three years and it is going to be scary when it happens,"" Wells said. All three agreed one thing missing from Washington is a spirit of cooperation and compromise. Lurvey said the pain of losing her job and dealing with foreclosure have taught her there are some things the government can't do. ""It is a good time to get back to what this country was made on -- it's the family,"" she said. ""And you know I think for awhile we were all going crazy and overspending and living beyond our means and this has kind of been a reality check for most people.""",0.7190017,3536

58,"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's two daughters had another reason to high-five their dad's election to the presidency Tuesday night: they're getting a puppy. President Bush's dog  Barney walks in the White House Rose Garden in 2007. ""Sasha and Malia,"" Obama said in his victory speech at Chicago's Grant Park, ""I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House."" The new White House pet will follow in the paw-steps of a menagerie of animals that have had the run of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue over the years. The Bush family shared their eight years at the White House with a cat, a feisty English springer spaniel and two Scottish terriers -- all of whom have their own pages on the president's Web site. The Clintons' Washington stay included a cat, Socks, who did not get along with their chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy. And Millie the springer spaniel's canine view of life in the White House -- as ""told to"" then-first lady Barbara Bush -- became a best-seller that outsold the memoirs of President George H.W. Bush. While many presidents took to heart President Harry Truman's admonishment -- ""If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog"" -- first pets have come in all shapes, sizes and species. Thomas Jefferson kept two grizzly bears in a cage on the White House lawn, while John Quincy Adams is said to have let his alligator use a bathtub inside.

Michael Lamar was laid off in January but has a new job as a Barack Obama look-alike. ""I wish I could announce such an economic package,"" he says, ""but there is a bank in Turkey that did it. It is Garanti. I wish we had Garanti in America."" Don't be fooled. This is a commercial on Turkish TV. The actor is a 44-year-old Barack Obama look-alike from Whitehall, Pennsylvania, named Michael Lamar. And he is shilling for a Turkish bank. In the month before the real Barack Obama is to visit Turkey, this ad campaign went out all across the country on television and on billboards, using the iconic, Warholian image of the American president to sell low-interest loans. The ""Mad Men"" behind the concept say their Obama look-alike was the perfect guy to sell what they described as Garanti Bank's own economic stimulus package. ""We probably wouldn't be doing this commercial if it was the previous president,"" said Can Celikbilek, a copy writer at the advertising company, Alametifarika. ""But in the case of Obama, he does represent hope, not only for the States but for the whole world."" For Obama look-alike actor Lamar, there was some irony about getting flown to Turkey to star in a commercial for a bank. He is a recent casualty of the global economic crisis. ""I was laid off in January of this year from JP Morgan Chase Bank in the U.S.,"" Lamar said, in a telephone interview from Pennsylvania. ""After 18 years in the company, I was just laid off. One of the cutbacks. I'm currently unemployed right now."" Or, was unemployed. Lamar's striking resemblance to the American president has suddenly offered the former software analyst a possible new career for supporting his wife and child. ""I'm available full-time now,"" Lamar said. ""I'm going to see where this leads me."" Lamar is now being represented by a casting agency in Los Angeles that specializes in celebrity look-alikes. Since he discovered his new ""talent,"" he has traveled to the Netherlands to appear in a commercial for a liquor chain and to Paris, where an activist organization brought him in to meet lawmakers at the National Assembly, as part of a campaign to raise awareness about racism and racial profiling in France. ""This was very exciting for me, a true privilege!"" Lamar said. During his brief visit to Turkey, locals did double-takes when they saw Lamar walk past. ""Even in the studio, the crew [members] were like, 'Oh! Is that Obama?"" said Celikbilek of Alametifarika advertising. Using the image of an American president to promote anything in Turkey is a remarkable reversal. U.S. approval ratings in Turkey plunged to 9 percent, according to a 2007 Pew Research poll, making America less popular in Turkey then almost anywhere else in the world, even though the two countries are NATO allies. There was widespread anger among Turks at the war in neighboring Iraq. But the election of Barack Obama appears to have dramatically improved perceptions of America. ""Bush was a dictator who attacked other countries,"" said Abdurrahman Ozdemir, who sells cigarettes from a small stall on the street. ""But we love Obama ... because he does not want to go to war with other countries."" ""We started to love and like America because of Obama,"" said a 33-year-old woman named Begum Arinc.

62,"New York (CNN)  -- In the schoolyard of American politics, President Obama is the big, smart kid with all of the test answers who's being bullied by a bunch of Neanderthal ankle-biters from all sides. Meanwhile, all the teachers are wondering, ""Why does he take this crap? He's bigger and smarter than all the other kids."" It's no surprise the Glenn Becks of the world have been attacking Obama since the moment he stepped into the Oval Office. Beck and his blathering buddies on the right -- you know, the stinky kids in the coatroom who eat their own boogers. Always pick on the kids least likely to fight back. That being said -- we did elect President Obama to change things, and so far the only thing he seems to be changing are his faux-patriotic lapel pins ... and his mind. With the public option in the public toilet, not asking or telling about ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the Gitmo Hilton still entertaining guests, and same-sex marriage so far off Obama's radar that it's now on his sonar, seeds of doubt have been planted in the left's collective mind. If this guy can't get his own party to step in line on health care reform, they wonder, then how the hell will he get other countries to do what he wants them to do? Although in some ways, that might be easier then dealing with these Blue Dogs who hump your leg ... and not in a good way. It's a valid concern. However, we can't expect him to accomplish all this sweeping change in less than a year. It's important that he lay the groundwork instead of just going all ""Decider"" on everyone and making gut choices. But he can't just be ""The Thinker,"" either. Last time I looked, ""The Thinker,"" by Rodin, had been sitting on his butt in the exact same place, for years. Unfortunately, laying groundwork doesn't win you any fans -- well, besides a few Nordic voters on the Nobel panel. Flexing muscles, now that wins you fans. Just ask the Governator. That's why the Financial Times said it's time for President Obama to pick a fight and win it in a knockout. But instead of working on that knockout, President Obama and his White House cronies are feuding with Fox News. While I'm loving this Fox hunt, the White House's strategy boggles my mind. This is not a war of necessity. Picking a fight with them is kinda like going to a biker bar after midnight -- as my mother used to say, ""Nothing good can happen."" That is, unless this heavyweight bout keeps escalating and we actually get to see Glenn Beck prancing around in a pair of sequined boxing shorts. When you disregard the action against Fox News, Obama seems to be paralyzed, like a frog that's had it stomach rubbed -- which may the reason he's got problems on both sides of the lily pad. Admittedly, I might be overreacting just a bit. The majority of the country is behind Obama. The situation just seems worse than it is because we're not used to this new era, in which you can actually criticize the president without being shouted down as an unpatriotic, Socialist, traitorous, granny-killing, freedom hater. After eight years of a presidency shrouded in darkness, we're not used to seeing the president's supporters, of all people, shining a light on his shortcomings. Back to the schoolyard, where Barry Obama is being bullied. You know what? He's big, he can take it. You know why? Because not only is he right in his beliefs, but he knows that if push comes to shove, he can lay out the rest of these runts with a couple of good smacks of his presidential pen. It's not time to panic, but President Obama needs to size up one of these twerps, cock back his arm, and take a swing soon, because the Democratic majorities in Congress won't last forever. President Obama won 53 percent of the vote last November, so we know he has it in him to win the big battles. We know he has a lot on his plate. But we just want one decisive victory. That's all we're asking for. A show of strength. Something to grow on. Show these class clowns who they're messing with. You don't have to be ""The Decider."" Just the president.

63,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama addressed Congress shortly after 9 p.m.  Tuesday, but a casual viewer might have believed it was actually morning in America. President Obama takes a page from Ronald Reagan's playbook in his speech to Congress. ""Morning in America"" was the theme of Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, and it was front and center in Obama's most critical event since Inauguration Day. The president who has pledged to reverse much of Reagan's economic revolution took a page from the 40th president's playbook in his 52-minute speech, striking a defiantly optimistic tone that belied the nation's sour mood and rebutted critics who have accused him of intentionally talking down the economy for short-term political gain. ""Though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before,"" Obama declared to a thunderous round of applause from a packed House chamber.  See video highlights of the speech, issue by issue » . Delivered against a backdrop of dismal economic news and with polls showing overwhelming majorities of Americans believing the country is on the wrong track, Obama's first speech to Congress amounted to a political tour de force. He proposed what many claim is a complete overhaul of the country's economic foundation while ripping his conservative predecessors for transferring ""wealth to the wealthy"" and gutting regulations ""for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market."" And he did it while employing some of Reagan's favorite rhetorical tools. Obama stuck to a fairly short list of priorities while invoking traditional American values of responsibility, hard work and thrift to pound home a back-to-basics message. iReport.com: 'Obama just replaced Reagan' ""A generosity, a resilience, a decency and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity ... Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure,"" he said. It is time, he declared, to ""summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit."" Ideological differences aside, the nation's 44th president has made no secret of his admiration for his Republican predecessor. ""Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not, and a way that Bill Clinton did not,"" Obama argued at the start of last year's Democratic primaries. Reagan, Obama said, knew that Americans ""want clarity. We want optimism. We want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that [has] been missing."" Tuesday night's speech featured all of those elements. ""The answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They exist ... in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth,"" Obama said.  What did you think of the speech? Rate it through our CNN report card » . The president's agenda as defined in his address to Congress may have been the most ambitious in a generation or even two, but it was also easily boiled down to a few bullet points: restore financial stability, strengthen education and promote energy independence and health care reform. It was, in many ways, the mirror image of 1981, when a newly inaugurated Reagan used the combination of stagnating economic growth and skyrocketing inflation to promote an equally ambitious, simple agenda: cut taxes, shrink government and build up the defense budget. ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,"" White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said shortly after the election in November. In fact, Obama's team believes that their boss has already trumped both the Great Communicator and Obama's immediate Democratic predecessor. Reagan didn't get his economic agenda passed until summer 1981, a senior White House official noted before the speech Tuesday. And when then-President Bill Clinton delivered his first speech to a joint session of Congress in 1993, he had only passed the Family and Medical Leave Act and was struggling politically because of the gays-in-the-military flap. In contrast, Obama has already signed into law a sweeping $787 billion economic plan, an expansion of children's health insurance coverage and pay equity legislation. The senior official boasted that Obama has ""gotten more done in 30 days ... than any modern president."" When he took office in 1981, Reagan said, ""Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."" Obama's response came Tuesday night: ""I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves, that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity."" It is morning in America again. A new day has clearly dawned.",0.7080865,2270

""And I think her candor and her courage have been heartening, and we certainly meant no slight to her whatsoever."" On Monday, Vanity Fair published an interview with Nancy Reagan on its Web site in which she suggested the Obama administration missed an opportunity by not inviting her to witness President Obama signing a measure in March expanding federal support for stem-cell research. The former first lady has long promoted such steps despite objections from many in the GOP. She has argued that expanded stem-cell research could have helped her husband, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. ""I would have gone, and you know I don't like to travel,"" she told the magazine.  Watch more on Gibbs' reaction to the controversy » . ""Politically, it would have been a good thing for (Obama) to do. Oh well, nobody's perfect. He called and thanked me for working on it. But he could have gotten more mileage out of it,"" she said.

Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel says President Barack Obama is using the media to keep citizens informed. Speaking to CNN's Larry King moments after Obama finished a prime time news conference, Emanuel said people are talking about issues like jobs, education and health care, and want to know where their president stands. ""You can say maybe there's overexposure,"" Emanuel said. ""I think if you watch and see, there have been greater audiences for the shows he has been on to answer these questions, because these are the questions the American people are asking around their kitchen tables."" In the past week, Obama has appeared on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" and NBC's ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,"" the first appearance by a sitting president on a late-night talk show. He fielded questions for an hour at Tuesday's news conference and also appeared last week on ESPN filling out his bracket for the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Some analysts say the president risks diluting his message in the public's mind by being visible so frequently. Some Republicans and other critics have accused Obama of maintaining a campaign mentality when he needs to be governing. But Emanuel said a public anxious about the economy has largely rejected those notions. ""I think in this troubled time ... the American people expect the president to talk to them, walk them through his thinking -- why he makes the decisions he makes, what are the tradeoffs to those decisions -- and carry them through this process,"" he said. ""I think they're very engaged in this conversation. If you look at the data, they are involved in this conversation and interested in this dialogue and appreciate an adult conversation with them about the changes they're making and the changes their government and their elected leaders are making on their behalf.""",0.70718205,7511
67,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- It was a heartwarming sight: Laura Ling and Euna Lee landing on U.S. soil and being reunited with their families. To the elation of their families, Bill Clinton returned to the U.S. with journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee. Then, after an appropriate amount of time for hugs and kisses, Bill Clinton appeared, descending from his movie-producer friend's plane like an angel from heaven. An emotional Ling practically referred to the former president as a messiah, describing to the media and well-wishers waiting at the airport how she and Lee thought they were being sent to a hard-labor camp, only to walk through a door to find Clinton. The crowd broke into loud applause. For all of those who wondered what Bill would do in Hillary Clinton's diplomatic world, wonder no longer. As details of the Clinton mission came out, it was revealed that the North Koreans themselves asked for Clinton, promising amnesty for the women upon delivery of the former president, whose visit eluded them while he was in office. The deal was done even before Clinton stepped on the plane. So what is next for Bill Clinton? If the mere thought of a meeting with him is enough to move a regime notorious for never moving, can the Obama administration use that star power to rescue three American hikers who ventured into Iran and are believed to be held by Iranian authorities? Can Clinton head off two Russian attack submarines cruising in the Atlantic off the East Coast of the United States? Former presidents are used as envoys and undertake humanitarian missions all the time. Then-President Clinton used former President Jimmy Carter to travel to North Korea in 1994 to negotiate the end to the first nuclear crisis. Clinton and his predecessor, George H.W. Bush, were tapped by Bush's son, then-President George W. Bush, to lead relief efforts to help Asian and African nations devastated by the 2004 tsunami and again in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. But the relationship between Bill and Hillary Clinton and President Obama is complex, to say the least. After a bitter-fought battle during the Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton supporters were looking for a robust role for her in exchange for her support of Obama, with many even suggesting her as a possible candidate for vice president. That idea was short-lived. The Obama team wanted Hillary far from the West Wing. And they wanted Bill even farther. When Obama tapped Hillary to be his secretary of state, there was no shortage of critics who asserted that her husband's global foundation and role as a high-paid public speaker would present a conflict of interest. The Clintons agreed to strict rules of the road to avoid such conflicts going forward. However Hillary never demurred in her praise for what her husband has accomplished, both during his eight years in the White House or post-presidency. Hillary herself has said she considered her husband a trusted adviser and could even consider using him where appropriate. He is a former president, after all. Bill Clinton has largely stayed out of the limelight, quietly continuing his globetrotting on behalf of the world's poor and downtrodden. In May, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed him as the United Nations' special envoy to Haiti in an effort to refocus international attention on the Caribbean country's deep economic problems and environmental decay. But with the success of his North Korean mission so quick and easy, it's conceivable that Bill Clinton could add the role of ""diplomatic cleaner"" to his resume -- a version of Harvey Keitel's role as Winston Wolfe in the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" -- a fixer of messy problems, which he solves with a combination of stylish charisma and lucid thinking under pressure. The Obama administration has no shortage of messy foreign policy problems that Hillary Clinton knows could use a Winston Wolfe.",0.706949,6406

Members of the National Economic Council brief President Obama on the economy Wednesday. ""Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency,"" Obama said. In his first full day in office, Obama touched upon many of the major issues facing his administration, and even carved out time to retake the oath of office. The move was aimed at dispelling any confusion that might arise from Tuesday's oath, which Chief Justice John Roberts flubbed by mixing up the order of the words. The do-over was also intended to erase any questions regarding the legitimacy of Obama's presidency, although per the Constitution, Obama became president at noon Tuesday without taking the oath. Earlier in the day, Obama said he would issue a pay freeze for his senior staff members. The new president has also promised swift action on the beleaguered economy. House Democrats, at Obama's urging, have signed an $825 billion economic recovery package that the president says will save or create up to 4 million jobs and invest in health care, energy and education.  Watch Obama address his staff » . House Republican leaders, however, asked to meet with Obama on Thursday to offer major changes to the recovery proposal. ""The challenge as we see it is to create a plan that helps middle-class taxpayers and small businesses without wasting money or exploding our national deficit,"" the leaders wrote in a letter to the new president. Rep. Paul Ryan, the top Republican on the House Budget committee, argued that the main tax provision in the Democrats' plan -- cutting payroll taxes -- was not an effective way to jump-start the economy. House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence declined to say whether the Democrats' package would get any Republican support if it didn't change significantly. Obama also moved fast to address a campaign promise to close the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The administration is drafting executive orders calling for the closure of the detention facility, according to two administration officials. Obama began the day with a moment of solitude in the Oval Office. When he arrived, he spent 10 minutes alone there, reading a note left for him on a desk by outgoing President George W. Bush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel met with the president 10 minutes later to discuss the daily schedule, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. Obama called Middle East leaders, including King Abdullah of Jordan, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Gibbs said. On Sunday, Israel and Palestinian militants declared a cease-fire after 22 days of fighting in Gaza. First lady Michelle Obama joined her husband in the Oval Office at 9:10 a.m., shortly before the first couple departed for the National Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral.

Barack Obama tells CNN's John King that it was ""tough"" for him to request the additional bailout funds. ""I mean, I think personally he is a good man who loves his family and loves his country,"" Obama said in an exclusive interview with CNN's John King. During the election season, Obama frequently campaigned against what he called Bush's ""failed policies"" and promised a ""clean break"" from the past eight years. Asked if there was anything he wanted to take back, now that he has spent more time with the president, Obama praised Bush's team for helping with a smooth transition and said part of what America is about is being able to have ""disagreements politically and yet treat each other civilly."" Obama also said he thought Bush made ""the best decisions that he could at times under some very difficult circumstances."" ""That does not detract from my assessment that over the last several years, we have made a series of bad choices and we are now going to be inheriting the consequences of a lot of those bad choices,"" Obama said. In addition to his relationship with Bush, Obama also discussed some key issues that he will face in the first days of his administration, including national security and the economy. Even before taking the oath of office, Obama has already faced a showdown with Congress over releasing what remains of the $700 bailout bill that Bush and Congress authorized before the election. The $350 billion that the Senate approved will come with specific conditions, Obama said. ""There's nothing wrong with us placing some conditions, making sure that the money's not going to executive compensation, making sure you're not seeing big dividend payoffs to shareholders and making sure that money is being left so that we can get credit flowing again, not just for individual homeowners who are losing their homes, but also small businesses who are the lifeblood of this economy. ""If they can't get credit, then they end up having to shutter their doors. And when they shutter their doors, people lose jobs. They then can't pay their mortgage, and you start down the road that we're on. We want to reverse that path, and that means that's the way we use the next $350 billion that Congress voted on, and that was a very tough vote for a lot of people.

The economy has been the main focus of the first week of President Obama's presidency. In his first week, Obama has focused on the economy, but he's also addressed other campaign promises. Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst, describes Obama's first week as a ""neat balancing act."" As Obama signs executive orders signaling a clear change of direction, he's also working hard to get bipartisan support for his economic stimulus, Schneider said. ""Mr. Obama doesn't have to do that. He could get a stimulus bill passed almost entirely with Democratic votes. But Obama doesn't want to be yet another president who divides the country,"" he said. The president has been working the phones with his party and made an unusual trip to Capitol Hill to meet with the opposing party to rally support for his $825 billion economic aid package. Following a meeting Tuesday with GOP congressman, Obama said he respects the ""legitimate philosophical differences"" between Democrats and Republicans on how to stimulate the economy. ""I don't expect 100 percent agreement,"" he said. ""But I hope we can put politics aside.""  Watch more on Obama's economic push » . Throughout the election season, Obama campaigned on his plan to restore economic equilibrium, and in his first public remarks after winning the election, he vowed to ""confront this economic crisis head-on."" Obama faces his first test with Congress on Wednesday when the House of Representatives votes on his economic recovery plan. The president has said he hopes to have the plan passed by Congress and on his desk for signing by mid-February. Obama also has wasted no time in putting his military and diplomatic agendas into action. In his first week, he already promised to send as many as 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan to boost the U.S. presence on the ground and increase development and reconstruction assistance. Seeking to demonstrate the Obama administration's early commitment to the country, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met last week with Afghan women legal professionals who were in Washington on a State Department training program on justice reform in Afghanistan. Obama also has pledged to crack down on militants in neighboring Pakistan. During the campaign season, Obama received a lot of criticism for saying that if it were necessary to root out terrorists, he would send U.S. forces into Pakistan without the country's approval. The president has called Afghanistan and Pakistan the ""central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism,"" and Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday that missile strikes in Pakistan will continue to root out al Qaeda members. ""Let me just say, both President Bush and President Obama have made clear that we will go after al Qaeda wherever al Qaeda is. And we will continue to pursue this,"" Gates said. As Obama seeks to stabilize the region, his administration has been advocating multilateralism and stressing ""smart power"" diplomacy by using all the tools of foreign policy available. Obama dispatched newly appointed Middle East envoy George Mitchell to the region and tapped diplomatic heavyweight Richard Holbrooke as his special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Obama also gave his first formal interview as president to Al-Arabiya, an Arab news channel, sending a message to the region that he wants a dialogue. ""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy,"" Obama told the Dubai-based satellite television network. ""We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect.""  Watch how Obama is reaching out to Muslims » . During his run for the White House, Obama pledged to improve ties with the Muslim world, draw down U.S. troops in Iraq and close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Two days after his inauguration, Obama issued an executive order to close the camp within a year. Another order formally bans torture by requiring that the Army Field Manual be used as the guide for terrorism interrogations, essentially ending the Bush administration's CIA program of ""enhanced interrogation"" methods. Guantanamo Bay and reports of torture there were huge points of contention for the Bush administration and were widely considered to have damaged the reputation of the United States. In another reversal of his predecessor, Obama struck down a rule that prohibited U.S. money from funding international family-planning clinics that promote abortion or provide counseling or referrals about abortion services. In a statement, Obama said that family planning aid has been used as a ""political wedge issue,"" adding that he had ""no desire to continue this stale and fruitless debate."" As Obama moves into the second week of his presidency, polls show that most Americans approve of the way he is handling his job so far. Former President Carter said he thinks Obama is ""doing just great."" ""I was particularly gratified that he carried out his promise, which didn't surprise me, that he would start working on the Middle East peace process the first time he was in office and not wait until the last year he was in office,"" Carter said on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Carter said he has confidence in Obama on economic issues, but he cautioned that the expectations for the new president are too high. ""I think a lot of the expenditures that will come as rapidly as possible might not occur until maybe 18 months from now -- some earlier. So we're going to have to be patient,"" he said. President Bush also won praise during the first week of his first term for staying on message. He built his first week around education and received positive reviews in the media during his honeymoon period. Bush's predecessor, however, was not met with such a warm welcome.

""I'm an American. They are Americans, and I don't feel that's OK. I feel very scared to be in this country with our leadership right now."" But Amy Veasley, a parent from the Dallas, Texas, area, said Monday that she was surprised by the controversy. ""The president of our country wants to call our students to action. I'm not sure why parents wouldn't want their students to hear out the leader of our country,"" she said.

Some school administrators had decided to show the president's speech, but others decided against it. And others were leaving the decision in the hands of individual teachers. One school district in Toronto, Ohio, decided to air the speech live for students in the third grade and up but not show it to younger children, according to CNN affiliate WTOV. Nine out of 550 students attending the Toronto schools showing the speech chose not to watch it, WTOV noted.

Bush delivered a nationally televised speech to students from a Washington school in fall 1991, encouraging them to say no to drugs and work hard. In November 1988, President Reagan delivered more politically charged remarks that were made available to students nationwide. Among other things, Reagan called taxes ""such a penalty on people that there's no incentive for them to prosper ... because they have to give so much to the government."" Some of the controversy over Obama's speech involved a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the address. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After pressure from conservatives, the White House distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals."" Duncan said Sunday that the passage was poorly worded. Some politically conservative figures said they had no problem with Obama speaking to students about education. ""I think there is a place for the president ... to talk to schoolchildren and encourage"" them, former first lady Laura Bush told CNN Monday. Parents should follow Obama's example and ""encourage their own children to stay in school and to study hard and to try to achieve the dream that they have,"" she added. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Obama's speech was a good idea if the message is a positive one about completing school. ""It is good to have the president of the United States say to young people across America, 'Stay in school, study, and do your homework,' "" Gingrich said. Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer accused Obama last week of trying to ""indoctrinate America's children to his socialist agenda.""

75,"(CNN) -- It's early April, and President Obama is on his way to France with the nation's top diplomat at his side. As he and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton converse in a private room aboard Air Force One, a photographer peers through the half-open door and snaps a candid picture of the formerly bitter campaign rivals. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton share a conversation on board Air Force One. Photographing two of the most powerful people in the country up-close and personal may seem like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to most Americans. But for photographer Pete Souza, it's a common occurrence. ""I try to photograph everything. Every meeting that the president does,"" Souza told CNN's John King on ""State of the Union."" On leave of absence from his normal post as an assistant professor of photojournalism at Ohio University's School of Visual Communication, Souza is the chief official White House photographer for President Obama, meaning he has an all-access pass to the president's most intimate and private moments. ""I look at my job as a visual historian,"" Souza said on Sunday. ""The most important thing is to create a good visual archive for history, so 50 or a hundred years from now, people can go back and look at all these pictures.""  Watch Souza talk to CNN's John King about his work » . While he relishes his unobstructed seat to a historic administration, he knows his limits. ""I'm smart enough to know that if he's having a one-on-one meeting with a head of state, I let them have some privacy,"" he said. ""I let him initiate any conversation. I am not there to take up his time in conversation."" Souza brings a unique perspective to the job, having also been the official White House photographer during Ronald Reagan's presidency. He acknowledged that Reagan was probably more formal, but told CNN he sees similarities between the two.  See some of Souza's photos » . ""I think they're both comfortable with themselves, which makes them great photographic subjects. The presence of the camera in behind-the-scene situations didn't seem to bother either president, which is good for me,"" he said. Souza released four never-before-seen photos on ""State of the Union,"" including one of the president and the first lady sharing a moment on the dance floor at the annual Governor's Ball, the couple's first big event at the White House. ""Earth, Wind and Fire was the band and I think the president was singing along to the music. I think their intention is to bring some fun to the White House, too,"" Souza said while reflecting on the picture. Previously a photographer for the Chicago Tribune, Souza began documenting Obama's ascension to the presidency in 2004 after a former colleague asked him to shoot the young politician's first year as a U.S. senator. Last year, Souza published ""The Rise of Barack Obama,"" an extensive book of photos chronicling Obama's rise from junior senator of Illinois to the highest office in the country. When asked to choose one picture as his favorite, Souza selected one of the president and first lady softly butting heads in a freight elevator, surrounded by staffers who appear to be avoiding eye contact with the couple. Michelle Obama is smiling playfully wearing her husband's jacket. ""I chose this one because it's a genuine moment. It was chilly in the elevator. He took his coat off, put it around his wife's shoulders and then there is this private moment going on between the two of them,"" he said. ""It's just a complete storytelling picture."" Though the historic nature of Obama's presidency is not lost on Souza, he doesn't view Obama any differently than past commanders in chief. ""Certainly you feel a sense of history, no question about that. When I look at him, I look at him as the president. I don't look at him as the African-American president, I look at him as the president.""",0.7023728,7126
76,"(CNN) -- Some issues, it seems, still transcend America's increasingly bitter partisan divide. Ex-President George H.W. Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates smile during Obama's speech Friday. President Obama attended a community service forum at Texas A&M University on Friday hosted by one of his Republican predecessors, former President George H.W. Bush. Obama took the opportunity to emphasize that, regardless of partisan politics, the government can only do so much with the challenges facing Americans. ""We face threats to our health, our climate and, of course, our security that have left many of our young people wondering what kind of future they will be leaving for their own kids,"" Obama told the audience, which including the former president and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. ""Anyone here thinks that our government always has the solutions, President Bush and I will be the first to tell you that you'll be sorely disappointed."" ""The government can build the best school, with the best teachers, but we can't run the PTA ... we can pass the most comprehensive health care reform bill, but Congress can't be on the ground in our communities caring for the sick and helping people lead healthy lives."" The two leaders met at Bush's presidential library to celebrate almost two decades of work from the Points of Light Institute, which was founded with Bush's encouragement in 1990 to ""encourage and empower the spirit of service,"" according to the group's Web site. The Institute takes its name from Bush's 1989 inaugural address, where he referenced ""a thousand points of light ... all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good."" Obama lauded the former president's lifetime of service -- from his enlistment at 18 to his community work during retirement -- noting that Bush was the first president to create a White House office devoted to promoting volunteer work. The president said Bush's legacy of service affected the life of his own family. ""It's a vision that's changed lives across this country, including that of a young woman who went to work for an organization called Public Allies to prepare young people for public service careers -- an organization initially funded by the Bush administration,"" Obama said. ""Her experience there inspired her to devote her own life to serving others, and that young woman happens to be my wife, Michelle Obama."" Obama latched onto the community service theme during last year's presidential campaign. He signed a measure in April designed to strengthen national community service efforts by boosting federal funding for thousands of volunteers in fields ranging from clean energy to health care and education. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, renamed to honor the late senator's sponsorship of the measure, will more than triple the number of positions in the AmeriCorps program, from 75,000 to 250,000, by 2017. ""Our government can help to rebuild our economy ... [but] we need Americans willing to mentor our eager young children, or care for the sick, or ease the strains of deployment on our military families,"" Obama said when signing the bill into law. The law created four national service corps and launched several other initiatives, including, among other things, a ""Summer of Service"" program to spur greater community outreach by middle- and high-school students. Older Americans were encouraged to volunteer more through the creation of a ""Silver Scholars"" program, under which individuals 55 and older who perform 350 hours of service receive a $1,000 award. The law increased the existing AmeriCorps educational stipend offered to volunteers to $5,350 -- the same amount as the maximum Pell college grant. Some critics have contended the measure, expected to cost roughly $6 billion over the next five years, is fiscally irresponsible in light of the current economic downturn. They also argue that the concept of volunteerism is undermined by providing financial compensation for community service. Points of Light Institute CEO Michelle Nunn, however, praised the legislation for encouraging people to ""volunteer their time and talents to positively impact the nation's largest problems.""

77,"(CNN) -- President Bush spoke live via satellite to the Republican National Convention Tuesday night. Here is the text of the speech: . President Bush says John McCain is ""ready to lead"" the United States. Bush: Good evening. As you know, my duties have me here in Washington tonight to oversee the federal government's efforts to help citizens recover from Hurricane Gustav. We are thankful that the damage in New Orleans and across the Gulf Coast was less than many had feared. I commend the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas for their sure-handed response and seamless coordination with the federal government. I thank all of the wonderful volunteers who stepped forward to help their brothers and sisters in need. We know that there is still risk even after the storm has passed. So I ask citizens across the region to listen closely to local officials and follow their instructions before returning to their homes. All of us are keeping the people of the Gulf Coast in our thoughts and prayers. As you gather tonight in Saint Paul, I want to share some thoughts about our nominee -- a great American, and the next president of the United States, John McCain.  Watch Bush's speech » . Before I do so, I want to say hello to two people in the hall with you tonight. I could have no finer examples of character, decency, and integrity than my mom and dad. I know what it takes to be president. In these past eight years, I've sat at the Resolute Desk and reviewed the daily intelligence briefings, the threat assessments and the reports from our commanders on the front lines. I've stood in the ruins of buildings knocked down by killers, and promised the survivors I would never let them down. I know the hard choices that fall solely to a president. John McCain's life has prepared him to make those choices. He is ready to lead this nation. From the day of his commissioning, John McCain was a respected Naval officer who made decisions on which the lives of others depended. As an elected public servant, he earned the respect of colleagues in both parties as a man to follow when there is a tough call to make. John McCain's life is a story of service above self. Forty years ago in an enemy prison camp, Lt.  Cmdr. McCain was offered release ahead of others who had been held longer. His wounds were so severe that anyone would have understood if he had accepted. John refused. For that selfless decision, he suffered nearly five more years of beatings and isolation. When he was finally released, his arms had been broken, but not his honor. Fellow citizens: If the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain's resolve to do what is best for his country, you can be sure the angry left never will. As the father of seven sons and daughters, John has the heart of a protector. He and his wonderful wife, Cindy, are adoptive parents. John is a leader who knows that human life is fragile ... that human life is precious ... that human life must be defended. We have seen John McCain's commitment to principle in our nation's capital. John is a steadfast opponent of wasteful spending. As president, he will stand up to the high-tax crowd in Congress and make the tax relief permanent. He will invest in the energy technologies of tomorrow and lift the ban on drilling for America's offshore oil today. John is an independent man who thinks for himself. He's not afraid to tell you when he disagrees. ... No matter what the issue, this man is honest and speaks straight from the heart. Last year, John McCain's independence and character helped change history. The Democrats had taken control of Congress and were threatening to cut off funds for our troops. In the face of calls for retreat, I ordered a surge of forces into Iraq. Many in Congress said it had no chance of working. Yet one senator above all had faith in our troops and the importance of their mission, and that was John McCain. Some told him that his early and consistent call for more troops would put his presidential campaign at risk. He told them he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war. That is the kind of courage and vision we need in our next commander in chief. My fellow citizens, we live in a dangerous world. And we need a president who understands the lessons of September 11, 2001: that to protect America, we must stay on the offense, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again. The man we need is John McCain. When he takes office next January, John will have an outstanding leader at his side. America will have a strong and principled vice president in the governor of the great state of Alaska, Sarah Palin. In the time the Oval Office has been in my trust, I have kept near my desk reminders of America's character -- including a painting of a West Texas mountain lit by the morning sun. It reminds me that Americans have always lived on the sunrise side of the mountain. We are a nation that looks to the new day with confidence and optimism. I am optimistic about our future, because I believe in the goodness and wisdom of the American people. I am optimistic because I have faith in freedom's power to lift up all of God's children and lead this world to a future of peace. And I am optimistic about something else: When the debates have ended, and all the ads have run, and it is time to vote, Americans will look closely at the judgment, the experience, and the policies of the candidates, and they will cast their ballots for the McCain-Palin ticket. While I am not with you in the Twin Cities on this wonderful night for our party, with Laura Bush speaking, you have clearly traded up. I am so proud the American people have come to know her gracious presence, her determined spirit, and her loving heart. Laura has been a fantastic first lady. Thank you, Laura, and thanks to all of you in the hall tonight. God bless you, and God bless America.",0.7013155,1521

The diplomats said she may also add other stops, including one in Southeast Asia. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because Clinton's schedule was still being finalized.

Making Asia Clinton's first overseas destination illustrates the Obama administration's desire for a broader partnership with China and its commitment to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, as well as strengthening ties with Tokyo and Seoul, the diplomats said.

He said Clinton met for three hours and 15 minutes with the North Korean leader but said he did not know what issues were discussed. But he said Clinton's views on a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are well-known. North Korea's state-run Korea Central News Agency said Clinton conveyed a message from Obama ""expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries."" But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message from Obama. Gibbs added the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March. He described Clinton's trip as a ""solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans."" Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to the stalled nuclear disarmament talks. North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has held several missile tests since then. The United Nations has responded by increasing sanctions on the nation. North Korea and the United States had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear program. North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000, near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in 2000 to meet with Kim.

I thank him for accepting the torch that was lit by our forefathers and proudly carrying it through the darkness of our struggles, trials and tribulations, bringing light and hope to a new generation, and for facing all those who said ""No"" and ""You can't win,"" or ""It will never happen,"" and firmly, proudly, defiantly saying, ""Yes I can!"" However, what I really hope people take away from that night is that this is not just a victory for African Americans, it is a victory for democracy that proves that our country provides possibilities for all people. It is also a sign that a metamorphosis is in progress. Today we saw that Americans respect experience, but are interested in change. I hope that we can somehow merge the best ideas of our differences and emerge with a president who epitomizes our highest and best ideals. While it remains unclear where we are going, last night proves that we as a people have moved beyond business as usual. I congratulate not just Sen. Obama on his victory, but the country on this landmark event that has shattered a past all too often filled with reasons to separate us as opposed to a voice of reason to unite us. The victory cup does not rest on the shoulders of the senator alone, but to all those who have been able to lift the conversation from petty racism, antiquated cut-throat politics, and fear-based campaigns to the larger issues of how we would like to see our country led into the future and ultimately how our country will be remembered. As the days and discussions of this political season continue, it is my sincere hope and prayer that we do not sink back into the abyss of political pettiness that has plagued our country and our lives for so many years. I am grateful to Sen. Hillary Clinton for giving, through this campaign, a chance for my daughters to see that their femininity is not a liability. Today both my sons and daughters came to understand that their ethnicity isn't viewed by progressive Americans as a limitation or a liability. iReport.com: Readers' feelings on Obama . For me it was almost déjà vu as I sat with my son. I remembered a little over 40 years ago watching the famous King speech with my dad. Similarly, I watched with my youngest son last night as a historical moment unfolded. He and I saw the dreams of slaves come true as the sons of slaves and the slave owners clapped their hands in one progressive sweep. As I drifted into sleep, all I could see was the twinkle in my son's eyes. His eyes were illuminated with possibilities, and his heart was filled with the potential of what is attainable for qualified, competent people of all types who prepare themselves intellectually and are well vested with a divine sensitivity to the ""fierce urgency of now!"" Congratulations Sen. Obama.",0.6864872,9619
84,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House released the text Monday of a controversial back-to-school speech to students from President Obama. The uproar over President Obama's back-to-school speech led the White House to release the transcript Monday. Many conservatives have expressed a fear that the address would be used to push a partisan political agenda. In the text of the speech, however, Obama avoids any mention of controversial political initiatives. He repeatedly urges students to work hard and stay in school. ""No matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it,"" he says. ""This isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country."" The text of the 18-minute speech was posted on the White House Web site so people can read it before its scheduled Internet broadcast to schoolchildren Tuesday. Read text of Obama's speech to students (pdf) Some of the president's critics have been adamantly opposed to the idea of an address by Obama to children. ""The president's speeches tend to be [about] what's wrong with the country and what can we do to fix it,"" said Bill Hogsett, a parent from Dallas, Texas. ""I believe this is the greatest country on Earth, and I try to teach that to my children. ... I don't want them hearing that there's a fundamental flaw with the country and the kids need to go forward to fix it."" Hogsett, who spoke Monday shortly before Obama's remarks were released, said he wanted to read the speech before making a final judgment. Amy Veasley, another parent from the Dallas area, said she was surprised by the controversy. ""The president of our country wants to call our students to action. I'm not sure why parents wouldn't want their students to hear out the leader of our country,"" she said. A Baltimore, Maryland, teacher who asked not to be identified bemoaned the fact that the country has ""become so polarized that we believe that our president is an enemy and not our leader."" During Bush's presidency, she said, ""whether I disagreed or not, I still saw him as a leader."" On Sunday, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that parents who are threatening to keep their children home Tuesday to avoid Obama's speech were being ""silly."" Appearing on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" Duncan emphasized that it is up to school officials whether to include the speech in the day's activities and that the message of the speech is simply to encourage children to finish school. ""That's just silly,"" he said of anyone planning to have their kids stay home because of the speech. ""They can go to school. They can not watch."" The speech is about ""the president challenging young people,"" Duncan asserted. Some school administrators have decided to show the president's speech, but others will not.  Watch CNN's Ed Henry talk about school speech uproar » . Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a possible contender for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, said Sunday that Obama's speech would disrupt an already-hectic first day of school for many students. ""I think there's concerns about the disruption,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" calling the scheduling of the speech a ""little ham-fisted"" by the White House.  Watch school reject Obama's speech on education » . ""There [are] also concerns about is this going to be done in an appropriate manner. I trust and hope that the White House will have a content that is not political and they're not using the public school infrastructure for that purpose."" Duncan, however, noted Obama's speech is not unprecedented. President George H.W. Bush delivered a nationally televised speech to students from a Washington school in fall 1991, encouraging them to say no to drugs and work hard. Read text of Bush's speech to students (pdf) In November 1988, President Reagan delivered more politically charged remarks that were made available to students nationwide. Among other things, Reagan called taxes ""such a penalty on people that there's no incentive for them to prosper ... because they have to give so much to the government."" Read text of Reagan's speech to students (pdf) Some of the controversy over Obama's speech involved a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the address. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After pressure from conservatives, the White House distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals."" Duncan said Sunday that the passage was poorly worded. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Obama's speech is a good idea if the message is a positive one about completing school. ""It is good to have the president of the United States say to young people across America, 'Stay in school, study, and do your homework,' "" Gingrich said. Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer last week accused Obama of trying to ""indoctrinate America's children to his socialist agenda."" ""Now that the White House got their hand in the cookie jar caught, they changed everything,"" he said Monday. After reading the text, he said, ""My kids will be watching the president's speech, as I hope all kids will.""

86,"(CNN) -- President Obama delivered the commencement address Friday to the U.S. Naval Academy's graduating class, speaking to an audience of 30,000 that included a former presidential candidate and proud parent of one of the graduates in attendance. Jack McCain shakes hands with President Obama at Friday's commencement ceremony. John Sidney McCain IV, more commonly known as Jack, on Friday became the fourth McCain to graduate from the Annapolis, Maryland, service academy and the fourth with the same name. ""America, look at these young men and women. Look at these sailors and Marines. Here are the values that we cherish. Here are the ideals that endure,"" Obama told the crowd. About midday at the academy's commissioning and graduation ceremony, McCain received a Bachelor of Science degree, taking the oath of office and being commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Navy 103 years after his great-grandfather did the same.  Watch Obama hug John McCain's son » . With parents John and Cindy McCain watching, he shook hands with the president and then walked back into the crowd to applause and more hugs. Joe McCain told CNN that his brother plans to join his father and great-grandfather as naval aviators. ""His grandfather, JSM Jr., was in submarines, commanding three different boats in World War II,"" he said. That grandfather later became Adm. McCain and was commander of the Pacific Theater during the Vietnam War, when Jack's father, now Arizona Sen. John McCain, was being held as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. In an interview last year with GoMids.com, Jack McCain reflected on the advice his father gave him on the day he arrived at the Naval Academy. ""My dad told me there is one thing McCains are good at, and that is not giving in to pressure, and honor -- keeping our honor regardless of what happens,"" Jack McCain said. ""He then said, 'Don't lie, cheat or steal -- anything else is fair game.' "" John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, frequently poked fun at his record at the Naval Academy while on the campaign trail, pointing out that he ""stood fifth from the bottom"" of his class and racked up dozens of demerits. At a campaign event last October, McCain joked that Jack needed a ""DNA check"" because he had yet to receive a single demerit. (Jack McCain told GoMids.com that he did accumulate some demerits -- for wearing flip-flops outside and forgetting to shave). McCain told Fox News on Thursday that his son is graduating ""in better class standing than I had, which wasn't hard to do."" ""I'm very proud of him,"" he said. Meghan McCain, Jack's older sister, sent a message on Twitter Friday saying her younger brother, Jimmy, could not attend because he is serving overseas. McCain told Fox News he is returning home this weekend. In his remarks to the students, Obama made a vow that he would not send them to war unless it is ""absolutely necessary."" ""It's a promise that as long as I am your commander in chief, I will only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary, and with the strategy, the well-defined goals, the equipment and the support that you need to get the job done,"" he said. ""This includes the job of bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end and pursuing a new comprehensive strategy to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Obama also promised additional assistance to military families, vowing that ""we will be with you every step of the way, increasing your pay, increasing child care and helping families deal with the stress and separation of war."" And he said new laws will help ensure that veterans are well taken care of. Obama's commencement address was his third and final of the year. He was also commencement speaker at Arizona State University and the University of Notre Dame.",0.6859948,3990
87,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On Inauguration Day, there's one scene at the White House that won't be playing out exactly as it has during past transitions: the traditional moving of the outgoing first family's belongings. President Bush walks out of the White House Oval Office on January 10. Anita McBride, chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, tells CNN that the Bushes have moved almost all of their belongings out of the White House ahead of schedule. ""There won't be ... the moving trucks for the Bushes coming here,"" McBride said, adding, ""The only things really left for President and Mrs. Bush are their personal belongings and luggage that they'll take that day."" McBride said Mrs. Bush directed residence staff early -- in the summer of 2008 -- to prepare the White House for the personal transition. ""It's probably the librarian in her,"" McBride said of Mrs. Bush, a former librarian. ""Maybe we've got a bit of a Dewey Decimal system of move-out process, but that certainly made it easier for the residence staff, and they very much appreciate it,"" McBride said. The actual clearing out of the Bushes' belongings began over the summer, McBride says, when many items were packed and taken to Crawford, Texas. Then, during the Christmas holiday, the Bushes moved their personal things out of Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, according to McBride. That means on Inauguration Day, while President Bush and Mrs. Bush, along with President-elect Obama and his family, are at the Capitol, staff in the White House residence will have more time to unpack and prepare the Obamas' personal belongings. ""They have rehearsed this over the last few weeks, everyone has their marching orders, it will be all hands on deck,"" said McBride. ""The residence staff will be here that morning, and they know what their jobs are when the moving truck for the Obamas' move-in arrives,"" she said, adding, ""Their things will be unpacked, and their clothes will be in their rightful place, and whatever furniture that they may have selected from the White House furniture collection will be in the place that they want it to be.""",0.684003,2446
88,"(CNN) -- Jenna and Barbara Bush know a lot about growing up in the White House. The Bush twins told Sasha and Malia Obama to ""remember who your dad really is."" The twin daughters of former President Bush were 7 when their grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush, was inaugurated, and 20 when their father became president. Like their dad, who left a note for President Barack Obama, Jenna and Barbara Bush wrote Tuesday to Obama's daughters about what to expect in the weeks and months ahead. ""We also first saw the White House through the innocent, optimistic eyes of children,"" the twins wrote in an open letter published in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal.  Growing up in the White House » . The twins reminisce in the letter about important events and historic moments they were able to be part of in a presidential family. But the Bushes also tried to prepare Sasha and Malia for some sobering truths. ""Although it's an honor and full of so many extraordinary opportunities, it isn't always easy being a member of the club you are about to join,"" they said. ""Our dad, like yours, is a man of great integrity and love; a man who always put us first. We still see him now as we did when we were 7: as our loving daddy."" But as their father was increasingly criticized in the media and mocked by late night comedians, the twins said they learned a lesson. ""He is our father, not the sketch in a paper or part of a skit on TV,"" they wrote. ""Many people will think they know him, but they have no idea how he felt the day you were born, the pride he felt on your first day of school, or how much you both love being his daughters. So here is our most important piece of advice: Remember who your dad really is."" It helps, wrote the Bushes, to surround yourself with loyal friends. The rest of the letter was more lighthearted, with the twins sharing some of their favorite memories of living in the White House, including playing house and hide-and-seek in what many children would consider to be the ultimate playground. ""When we played house, we sat behind the East Sitting Room's massive curtains as the light poured in illuminating her yellow walls,"" the girls said. ""Our 7-year-old imaginations soared as we played in the enormous, beautiful rooms; our dreams, our games, as romantic as her surroundings. At night, the house sang us quiet songs through the chimneys as we fell asleep."" They also told the Obama girls to embrace any opportunity they had: ""When your dad throws out the first pitch for the Yankees, go to the game."" ""In fact, go to anything and everything you possibly can: the Kennedy Center for theater, state dinners, Christmas parties (the White House staff party is our favorite!), museum openings, arrival ceremonies, and walks around the monuments."" ""Just go,"" they wrote. The twins also reminded Sasha and Malia to be themselves -- kids -- saying even if they travel over holidays like Halloween, the girls should dress up and trick-or-treat down a plane aisle. ""Slide down the banister of the solarium, go to T-ball games, have swimming parties, and play Sardines on the White House lawn,"" the Bush girls said. ""Have fun and enjoy your childhood in such a magical place to live and play."" Jenna and Barbara Bush told the girls to cherish the pet that their father so publicly promised them. ""Sometimes you'll need the quiet comfort that only animals can provide,"" they said. ""Four years goes by so fast,"" they wrote. ""So absorb it all, enjoy it all!""",0.68356836,3702
89,"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel will bring a ""tough-minded"" and ""pragmatic"" approach to the White House when he becomes President-elect Barack Obama's chief of staff, according to people who know the Chicago, Illinois, native. Rep. Rahm Emanuel has experience in the White House, on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. Emanuel, a former top aide to President Clinton, has accepted the position in the new administration, Obama confirmed in a statement Thursday. ""I announce this appointment first because the chief of staff is central to the ability of a president and administration to accomplish an agenda,"" Obama said. ""And no one I know is better at getting things done than Rahm Emanuel."" In the job, Emanuel would oversee the White House staff. The chief of staff is usually involved in all the major decisions that the president makes and is responsible for making sure the administration carries out the president's wishes.  Watch Emanuel call himself ""fortunate"" » . The chief of staff also often is involved in negotiations with congressional leaders when major legislation is under consideration. Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Emanuel: ""An excellent choice."" ""Rahm knows the Hill. And he knows the White House. He is a brilliant strategic thinker and someone who knows how to get things done,"" Manley said. Manley also rejected the idea that Emanuel is a true partisan that could not work with Republicans. ""That's ridiculous. Rahm understands politics is the art of compromise. He's got a deeply held set of views but he also understands to get things done you have to compromise,"" he said. After leaving the Clinton White House, Emanuel, 48, was an investment banker on Wall Street and later was elected to the House of Representatives in 2002 from a heavily Democratic Chicago district. He quickly rose to become the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House.  Watch what Emanuel brings to the White House » . It is Emanuel's combination of experiences -- plus his strong personal relationship with Obama -- that would make him a strong chief of staff, said CNN political analyst Paul Begala, a fellow Clinton veteran. ""He has spent more time in the White House than President-elect Obama has. That matters a lot. It is a special place with its own rhythms,"" Begala said.  See who Obama may be considering for his Cabinet » . ""But, maybe most importantly, he's got the relationship. He has known Barack and Michelle Obama for a number of years."" Before reports emerged that he had accepted the position, Emanuel told WLS-TV in Chicago that he had to consider the possible impact on his family.  Watch how Obama is starting his transition » . ""I have a lot to weigh: the basis of public service, which I have given my life to, a career choice. And most importantly, what I want to do as a parent,"" Emanuel said in an interview that aired Wednesday. Emanuel added: ""This is not a professional choice. This is a personal choice about what my wife and I want to do for our family, as much as what to do with my career."" Emanuel's at-times blunt approach would ensure the White House runs smoothly for the new president, said Mack McLarty, Clinton's former chief of staff.  Watch as McLarty calls Emanuel an ""excellent choice"" » . ""Rahm is high energy. He's direct. He's a tough-minded pragmatist. So I think the years have been good to him in that regard,"" McLarty said. ""I think the high-energy directness will serve him well. ""Rahm, like a lot of us, made mistakes, but he quickly corrected them."" However, the lawmaker's direct style has ruffled a number of feathers in Washington, and Emanuel is known as one of the toughest partisan fighters on Capitol Hill. After reports that Emanuel had agreed to be Obama's chief of staff on Thursday, the top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, questioned the president-elect's pick.  Election T-shirt: Obama inspires historic victory . ""This is an ironic choice for a president-elect who has promised to change Washington, make politics more civil and govern from the center,"" Boehner said. According to a 2006 profile of Emanuel in Fortune magazine, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma warned his fellow Republicans of Emanuel's ferocity in a letter two years ago. ""He's dangerous,"" Cole told Fortune then. ""He has a closing intensity. When he's got a political kill in sight, he's absolutely relentless."" But David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst who has worked in five administrations, said the contrasting styles between Obama and Emanuel could help the new president get things done in Washington.

90,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The 2009 presidential inauguration is looking to be historic and, frankly, headache-inducing for the throngs of people descending on the nation's capital to watch Barack Obama sworn in as the 44th president.

Police will be shutting bridges across the Potomac River into Washington, along with a huge chunk of the downtown area. Two of the major routes coming into the city -- Interstates 395 and 66 -- will be closed to inbound traffic, at least for private vehicles. And for those coming from Virginia, all of the bridges between the state and Washington are going to be shut. In order to get in: walk or take public transport, such as the metro area's subway system. Amtrak says that it has increased the number -- and length -- of trains running to Washington on Inauguration Day and that tickets are still available but are going fast. iReport.com: Are you going to the inauguration?

91,"(OPRAH.com) -- For all the majesty of the White House, the first lady has already infused it with a palpable ease; her presence makes the place feel open and approachable. When we sit down to talk, Michelle Obama seems as relaxed as she did when I first interviewed her and her husband in their Chicago apartment in 2004. ""This room has the best light in the house,"" she tells me as we settle in, shoes off, on a comfortable sofa. ""And there's pie here, too. The pie in the White House is dangerously good."" -- Oprah Winfrey . Michelle Obama is the first person to join Oprah Winfrey on the cover of O magazine . Oprah Winfrey: How are you a different woman today than you were when Barack Obama announced his candidacy in 2007? Michelle Obama: I'm more optimistic. More hopeful. It comes from traveling all over America and connecting with so many different people. And this was long before anyone thought Barack had a chance. This was the kindness of strangers. I think we should all have to get to know one another around kitchen tables. It changed me. It's helped me to give other people the benefit of the doubt. Winfrey: What did you see that changed you? Obama: I saw our shared values. We fundamentally want the same things for ourselves and for each other. We want our kids to be safe and to grow up with some resources and aspire to a slightly better life than ours. No one's looking for a handout. People just want fairness and opportunity. Oprah.com:The heart and mind of Michelle Obama . Winfrey: That's so good to hear. Because you know what? We live in an ""American Idol"" culture where it seems like everyone just wants to be in the spotlight. Obama: That's not the America I saw. People value their communities. They're rooting for one another. Even in places where I thought people wouldn't accept or relate to me, I always walked out feeling like, ""Wow -- that was fun."" That changed me. And it helped prepare me for this. Because I think if you're going to be first lady, you have to believe in the possibility of what this country stands for. You have to see it in action and know what you're working toward. Oprah.com: How Michelle gets unstuck . Winfrey: That's so interesting -- and it all came from sitting around kitchen tables. Speaking of which, did you change your diet during the campaign? Obama: When we first started running, my big concern was making sure we ate well on the road. So we started looking at our diet, trying to eliminate junk, getting seasonal fruits and vegetables that were grown locally. We walked the kids through reading labels. We talked about why one juice might be better than another. Winfrey: That's right. In addition to eating well, do you work out? Obama: Yes. There's a small gym here that has everything we need. I work out about four or five days a week -- and Barack does six. He's a workout zealot. Winfrey: Well, you look better than ever -- despite the rumors that you've got a baby bump. Obama: [Laughter.] I know -- I was like, ""Baby bump? As hard as I work on my abs?!"" Winfrey: Okay, so that's settled. Back to exercise. You do treadmill? Obama: I do treadmill, I do weights . Winfrey: I think anyone who saw you on the cover of Vogue knows you do weights. Those arms! Obama: I also do some jump rope, some kickboxing -- and I'd like to take up Pilates, if I could figure out whether there's time. After I had Malia, I began to prioritize exercise because I realized that my happiness is tied to how I feel about myself. I want my girls to see a mother who takes care of herself, even if that means I have to get up at 4:30 so I can do a workout. Winfrey: When you first told me that a few years ago, I was like, ""You get up at 4:30 to work out?"" Obama: Well, I just started thinking, if I had to get up to go to work, I'd get up and go to work. If I had to get up to take care of my kids, I'd get up to do that. But when it comes to yourself, then it's suddenly, ""Oh, I can't get up at 4:30."" So I had to change that. If I don't exercise, I won't feel good. I'll get depressed. Of course, it's easier to do it here, because I have much more support now. But I always think about women who don't have support. That's why work-family balance isn't just a policy conversation; it's about changing the expectations of who we have to be as women and parents.

92,"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- George Obama, the half brother of U.S. President Barack Obama, told CNN on Sunday that he was released from a Kenyan jail hours after his arrest on suspicion of marijuana possession. George Obama was arrested in Kenya on suspicion of marijuana possession, according to police. Kenyan police did not confirm whether George Obama was still in their custody. Obama spoke to CNN from his cell phone, and a relative also said he was released. He said he was arrested on Saturday and released later that day. Obama was arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis, known in Kenya as bhang, and resisting arrest, Inspector Augustine Mutembei said. He was held at Huruma police post in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and scheduled to appear in court Monday, Mutembei said. But Obama told CNN all charges against him were dropped. Police would not comment on that. Speaking from behind bars on Saturday, Obama denied the allegations. ""They took me from my home,"" he said. ""I don't know why they are charging me."" George Obama and the president barely know each other, though they have met. George Obama was one of the few people closely related to the president who did not attend the inauguration in Washington. In his memoir, ""Dreams from My Father,"" Barack Obama describes meeting George as a ""painful affair."" His trip to Kenya meant meeting family he had never known. CNN tracked down George Obama in August 2008 and found him at a small house in Huruma, a Nairobi slum, where he lives with his mother's extended family. His birth certificate shows he is Barack Obama's half brother. The two men share the same Kenyan father. In the memoir, Barack Obama struggles to reconcile with his father after he left him and his mother when he was a child. Barack Obama Sr. died in a car accident when George was 6 months old. And like his half brother, George hardly knew his father. George was his father's last child and had not been aware of his famous half brother until he rose to prominence in the Democratic primaries last year. Unlike his grandmother in Kogela, in western Kenya, George Obama received little attention from the media until reports about him surfaced in August 2008. The reports sprung from an Italian Vanity Fair article saying George Obama lived in a shack and was ""earning less than a dollar a day."" The reports left George Obama angry. ""I was brought up well. I live well even now,"" he said. ""The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. ""I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges,"" Obama said. Obama, who is in his mid-20s, said at the time that he was learning to become a mechanic and was active in youth groups in Huruma. He said he tries to help the community as much as he can.",0.6761291,2328
93,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- As Washington gears up for January's presidential inauguration with high-priced tickets to fancy affairs, one businessman is making sure that some of the less fortunate will have a chance to share in the festivities. Earl Stafford is a Virginia businessman helping the disadvantaged see the inauguration. Virginia businessman Earl Stafford has spent $1 million to give hundreds of poverty-stricken and terminally ill Americans, along with wounded men and women in uniform, an inauguration experience that won't cost them anything. The zero-dollar price tag is even more shocking, considering that tickets to the inaugural events are going for hundreds of dollars, the city's remaining hotel rooms are edging into four-figure territory, and even basements and couches miles from the National Mall are going for a premium on Craigslist. Tickets for the inauguration are distributed through members of Congress, and just 240,000 seats are available for the swearing-in ceremony. The tickets are supposed to be free, but with demand outpacing supply, some people have been trying to scalp tickets for thousands of dollars. Stafford's event is one of the splashiest inauguration packages out there. It includes high-end hotel rooms and luxury suites, food and drinks, a heated viewing spot right above the parade route, even gowns and tuxedos to wear to celebratory balls and a beautician to help attendees get ready. Hours after the election, Stafford, a 60-year-old businessman and son of a Baptist minister, invested in what the JW Marriott billed as its $1 million ""build-your-own-ball"" inaugural hotel package. His family's nonprofit foundation, the Stafford Foundation, is footing the bill for what it is calling the People's Inaugural Project, but it is also hoping to get money from sponsors. Stafford said Thursday that he hopes the balcony terrace is filled ""with those who are disadvantaged, those who are distressed, mingling with those who aren't so. And we hope to see on their faces a sense of excitement."" ""I was inspired to do this by the Lord. ... It's not about us but about us helping other people,"" he said. At least third of the tickets to the event will go toward people who are needy or underprivileged, and the rest of those participating could be people from sponsoring foundations, companies or volunteers. Everything, he said, will be taken care of: transportation, evening gowns and tuxedos for the ball. He hopes that providing a front row seat to history will inspire those invited to do good things in their communities. Stafford said he began thinking about the project in March. He voted for Barack Obama, and records show he contributed $4,600 to the Democrat's campaign, according to the Washington Post. Stafford, a retired Air Force officer, noted that he does not agree with all of Obama's positions. But, he told the paper, he decided the inauguration would be ""a transition in history, if you will ... and everyone should be included.""

94,"(CNN) -- The September issue of Essence magazine features an interview with Sen. Barack Obama and his family inside their Chicago home. Angela Burt-Murray is editor-in-chief of Essence magazine. Essence editor-in-chief Angela Burt-Murray said it took a year for the magazine to gain access to the Obama's Illinois home for an intimate interview with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, his wife, Michelle, and their daughters, Sasha and Malia. Burt-Murray talked Thursday with CNN ""American Morning"" anchor Kiran Chetry about the interview and the Obama family. Chetry: You are the first African-American media outlet to get this inside look. Did your team get a chance to see the real Obamas? Burt-Murray: I think we did. We went to their home on the South Side of Chicago and it was wonderful to see them as a family interacting with each other, and see the girls skipping around the house, just acting like it's a normal, everyday occurrence to have a camera crew in their home and Secret Service at different points throughout the house and around the yard. But it didn't really seem to impact the girls in any way.  Watch what Essence found inside the Obamas' home » . Chetry: Much was made of an earlier televised interview they with their daughters and they said, looking back, they probably shouldn't have done that. There is so much interest about their family, and yet they want to protect their girls. How do they balance that? Burt-Murray: They try to take a look at who is around the family and make sure they try to keep things as structured as possible. But also, you have instances where magazines like Essence show up to take photographs, but the girls are very relaxed because they're in their home environment. And I think that's the difference between our photo shoot and what you saw on television. Taking the girls outside of their home and putting them in the spotlight is probably a bit more challenging for them as parents. Chetry: They have to deal with completing stereotypes, if you will: They were parodied as these angry black radicals and as these Ivy League elitists. In the magazine, Gwen Ifill wrote, ""The Obamas pride themselves on creating a family picture that is authentically black with shades of Norman Rockwell."" Explain that. How are they getting that image out. Burt-Murray: I think it's the idea that they're just an average American family. They have strong family values, they're deeply rooted in their community and they want to show their girls a great example of achievement. But they also want to be a model for the rest of their community. The Obamas talk about in our story how important it is for them to continue to live in their South Side Chicago neighborhood because it's a neighborhood in transition. So you have children who have the opportunity to see an African-American man run for the highest office in the nation right in their neighborhood. So they're modeling not only for their children but also for the larger community. Chetry: They do live in a gated community, a $1.6 million home, so it's out of reach for a lot of people. Burt-Murray: But it's so accessible. While we were there photographing them for Essence, you could see the cars going by and stopping and people getting out to take photographs. The girls were on the porch and people could see them. There is some normalcy there, but it's also obviously something very special and different. Chetry: They said race had been prominent on the campaign trail. Barack Obama told Gwen Ifill that he thinks race is a national obsession. He thinks the racial divide is not as big an issue in this country as it's made out to be. Burt-Murray: As evidenced by the success that he's had with his campaign, you can certainly see that attitudes are shifting. But there are still challenges, obviously, that need to be addressed. And it keeps coming up throughout the campaign. So it will be interesting to see what happens when the country goes to the polls in November.",0.67461765,4504
95,"(CNN) -- She's being hailed as the ""face of the economic crisis,"" and now Henrietta Hughes has become something of a media star after reaching out to President Obama in an emotional plea for help. President Obama talks to Henrietta Hughes at a town hall rally in Fort Myers, Florida, on Tuesday. Her message: My son and I are homeless, and we need immediate help. ""I have an urgent need, unemployment and homelessness, a very small vehicle for my family and I to live in,"" Hughes told Obama Tuesday at a town hall rally in Fort Myers, Florida, as he pushed for passage of his stimulus plan in the Senate. ""The housing authority has two years waiting lists, and we need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to. We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom. Please help."" Hughes said she had been homeless after her son lost his job and, subsequently, their home. Although her son has been looking for work, Hughes says, so far, no luck. The Fort Myers-Cape Coral area -- in heavily Republican Lee County, which went for GOP presidential nominee John McCain in the 2008 election -- has seen record housing foreclosure rates.  Watch CNN's Ed Hornick discuss the story » . According to the White House, the area had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation last year, with 12 percent of housing units receiving a foreclosure-related notice. Median housing prices in the Fort Myers metropolitan area have plummeted from $322,000 in December 2005 to less than $107,000 in December 2008, the Obama administration notes. And nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost in Fort Myers in the past year. The president offered Hughes a kiss on the cheek and a promise: ""We're going to do everything we can to help you, but there are a lot of people like you.""  Watch more of Hughes' emotional plea to Obama » . Some questioned the circumstances of Hughes' appearance at the event. Blogger Michelle Malkin, in a story on the conservative Web site TownHall.com on Wednesday, said that if Hughes ""had more time, she probably would have remembered to ask Obama to fill up her gas tank, too."" ""The soul-fixer dutifully asked her name, gave her a hug and ordered his staff to meet with her. Supporters cried, 'Amen!' and 'Yes!' "" she added. One reader questioned Hughes' motives and asked how the homeless woman got to the rally at all. ""How does a 61-year-old homeless woman who's living in a pickup truck with her son JUST HAPPEN to get a ticket so she can VERY PUBLICALLY ask Prez. Obama for a HOUSE? Anyone? Who pushes her up on stage? She's right at the front of the crowd. Did she just happen to get a seat there?"" asked reader Erik E. In Fort Myers, a city of about 60,000, people began lining up for tickets to the Obama event over the weekend. Many camped out overnight, with tents and sleeping bags springing up near the front door, and all tickets were given away in less than an hour. White House spokesman Joshua Earnest said Wednesday that after she spoke, the administration connected Hughes -- who did not vote in the 2008 election because she didn't have a home -- with local housing officials, who happened to be in the crowd. On Wednesday, the head of the local housing authority, Marcus Goodson, said he met with Hughes. He said he's working on finding her a housing unit with a shorter waiting time and that he's emailed a White House staff member with the update. But it wasn't just officials reaching out. Chene Thompson -- the wife of state Rep. Nicholas Thompson, R-Fort Myers -- offered Hughes and her son a house in nearby La Belle rent-free, according to a spokeswoman, and she is interested in taking it. ""Basically, I offered Ms. Hughes and her son the opportunity to stay in my home rent-free for as long as they need to,"" Thompson told WBBH-TV in Fort Myers. ""I'm not a millionaire, I'm not rich, but this is what I can do for someone if they need it."" Hughes will check out the house in the coming days, according to Thompson's office. In the meantime, she has set up shop in the district office where she gave media interviews. And help for the woman whose story touched the president keeps pouring in. A Web site, HenriettaHughes.com, was set up featuring video clips of the homeless woman at the rally and information about her plight. The site hails her as ""the face of the economic crisis."" The owner of the site said Hughes has ""brought to [light] the homeless [an] unemployment problem we have in the United States."" ""As a local southwest Florida resident, I have seen countless stories like Henrietta's. I wanted to take this opportunity to promote awareness of our plight on a national level. If you as equally concerned as I am, please bookmark this site and sign up for updates,"" the owner wrote on the site. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on the stimulus package . And Fort Myers Mayor Jim Humphrey, a Republican, said Wednesday that his ""community has responded"" to Hughes' story. ""I even received a phone call from a lady in Ocala wanting to offer her $50 a month, so what we're seeing is, this should be a nonpartisan issue,"" he said.  Watch Humphrey discuss Hughes' story » . Linda Bergthold, a health policy expert, wrote on the liberal blog HuffingtonPost.com that it was a touching moment that highlighted a community coming together. ""It would have been interesting had Obama turned to the crowd and asked anyone who had a solution for Henrietta to step forward afterwards. But he didn't have to. People came forward anyway,"" she wrote Wednesday. ""The dilemma Ms. Hughes described is not limited to her. ... Her request was a compelling one and it only highlights issues of homelessness that will surely get worse as the economic downturn deepens.""

96,"Aboard the Tea Party Express (CNN) -- From the stage, Deborah Johns is the angry conscience of the tea party movement. A protester uses a Nazi swastika to make a point at a Tea Party Express stop in Dallas, Texas. ""Question everything your government is doing,"" she tells a crowd of about 100 from the bus's stage in the parking lot of the Winners casino in Winnemucca, Nevada. Under a setting sun on the steps of the state capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, Johns says: ""Our men and women took an oath when they put on the uniform to defend and protect this country from enemies both foreign and domestic. I think we've got some domestic enemies in the White House."" On a sunny afternoon in Louisville, Kentucky, Johns works the crowd of about 2,000 into a frenzy. ""The men and women in our military didn't fight and die for this country for a communist in the White House,"" she says, and the crowd erupts in a chant of ""U-S-A, U-S-A!""  Watch rally participants converge on Washington » . On the bus, Johns slips off her heels and slips on a pair of ankle socks. She curls up under a quilt her grandmother made. She favors skirts and cardigans -- a pit bull in cashmere. She leads the rallies in each city with Mark Williams, a former talk radio host who now writes books and makes the rounds on cable TV chat shows. Both work for Our Country Deserves Better, the conservative political action committee sponsoring the Tea Party Express bus tour. The tour concluded Saturday at the U.S. Capitol in Washington after a 34-stop tour that began August 28 in Sacramento, California. Williams is the showman of the bunch. His signature line when he gets the mic goes like this: ""You can have our country when you pry it from our ... cold ... dead ... fingers!"" Again the crowd erupts.  Watch scenes from Tea Party Express rallies » . Seldom seen on stage are the two gurus of the tea party movement, veteran politico Sal Russo and his protégé, Joe Wierzbicki. They are charged with turning the passion on display at the tea parties into political action. They have three goals: Defeat President Obama's health care reform efforts, win back the House and Senate in 2010 and take the White House in 2012. Russo grew up in a house full of working-class Democrats in Monterey, California, and nearly gave his father a heart attack when he became a Republican. His first paid gig in politics was working for Ronald Reagan's 1966 California gubernatorial campaign, and he has worked in conservative politics ever since. Russo often watches the raucous tea party events from his perch in the bus. Besides Johns and Williams each event features several musical acts and featured speakers. The crowd is its own sideshow. Tea partyers are a creative lot, and many in the crowd express themselves by way of their clothing and signs.  See some of the getups and signs » . ""Obamacare Condense Cream of Crap soup"" reads a sign in Sparks, Nevada. In Dallas, Texas, a darker mood prevails. A homemade sign with ""Obama Lies"" features a bold, black swastika. As the tour moves on, Nazi imagery becomes more prominent -- and sometimes confused. One sign at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, has Obama's portrait sandwiched between pictures of Adolf Hitler and communist philosopher Karl Marx. In Canton,Ohio, Obama and Hitler adorn a sign reading ""Hitler made great speeches, too."" In Elko, Nevada, over a Basque supper of oxtail, lamb and sweetbreads, Russo assesses the tea party movement. ""There are some people who are mad at everyone,"" he says, ""but there are others who say, 'How do we move beyond this and turn it into action?'"" Rare is the conversation with Russo in which he doesn't bring up the name of his idol and one-time boss, Ronald Reagan. But if there is a Reagan out there to take the reins of the tea party movement, Russo doesn't know who that person is. ""It's opened for a leader. I don't see anyone out there that can grab it,"" he says. ""I'll be surprised if someone emerges. I don't see who that is."" Many in the crowd hope former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will emerge as the leader of the movement, ""but she has so many negatives,"" Russo says. If the tea party movement has an architect, it is Joe Wierzbicki. Unassuming in wrinkled khakis and a polo shirt, he is in near perpetual motion. Hands gesturing wildly through the air, he describes his plan. ""There are going to be stops along the way. The first stop is going to be the health care reform act,"" he says. If the tea partyers can play a part in stopping the president's health care efforts they will be poised for a much bigger challenge: taking control of Congress from the Democrats, he says. ""Those politicians that aren't responsive to this message are going to face a lot of trouble in their re-election bids in 2010,"" he says. That the tea party movement has no leader at this point is just fine with Wierzbicki. He says right now the movement is centered on a few key issues: taxes, expansion and distrust of Obama. ""If there was a leader there might be a divisive factor,"" he says. In Wierzbicki's plan, the movement doesn't need a leader until after the 2010 election. ""From then to 2012 is probably the period of time when you'll find a big national leader that will emerge that the majority of the people in this movement will feel comfortable following,"" he says. No one on the tea party express seems concerned with the vocal fringe of the crowds that come with offensive signs -- besides Nazi imagery, a poster of Obama as an African witch doctor has become popular -- or the numerous conspiracy theories that float around most tea parties. In Battle Creek, Michigan, a woman in her 60s says, ""I really don't want to be a guinea pig for the experiment they have with the population control."" In Canton, Ohio, a woman argues with an Obama supporter: ""He's going after our kids to try to indoctrinate them into a national defense army."" The Tea Party Express tour has been free of violence, but occasional outbursts of vitriolic hatred toward the president combined with some menacing outward appearances often overshadow the more moderate tea partyers. iReport.com: Weigh in on health care . In Louisville, Kentucky, two young men in camouflage fatigues roamed the crowd trying to recruit new members for their militia called the Ohio Valley Freedom Fighters. They bear signs reading ""AK-47s: today's pitchfork"" and ""Quit worrying. Start your militia training today."" In Jackson, Michigan, a young man didn't need a sign. He was carrying the real thing: A loaded AK-47 assault rifle and two loaded handguns. ""I don't want a revolution. I don't want a civil war,"" he said. ""But it is a possibility. It's there as an option, as a last resort."" From the stage, Deborah Johns and Mark Williams never interact with most of these characters. Russo shrugs it off, saying that the early stages of every political movement have people like this. To Wierzbicki these troubling elements are just part of the price of a grassroots movement. He is convinced they will not derail the movement. ""The message will be moderated by the time it gets to 2010,"" he says.",0.67245847,7657

Like Obama, Wiesel stressed that the lessons of Buchenwald are that humanity must unite to keep such atrocities from happening again and work toward making the 21st century ""filled with promise and infinite hope."" ""Memory must bring people together, rather than set them apart. Memories here not to sow anger in our hearts, but on the contrary, a sense of solidarity with all those who need us,"" Wiesel said. Obama told reporters earlier in the day that his great-uncle, Charles Payne, had a ""very difficult time re-adjusting to civilian life"" after helping his Army division liberate the Ohrdruf forced labor camp, a subdivision of Buchenwald .

Three of his children graduated from college. Two have died -- one as a youth, one as an adult. It never gets easier, he says, no matter what age they die. Obama has already brought inspiration to future generations of his own family. ""I might be dead and gone, but it's going to be a good thing to me, because I know that they ain't gotta go through what I went through. They'll have a better time, a more joyous time, than what I had when I come along. It is gonna be grand to them and to me, too."" ""He knows what it is to come up without a father and what it is to come up for what you work for,"" Presley says. ""Me and the poor man coming up, we had to work for what bread I got."" Presley shifts back and forth on his feet as he speaks. His flannel shirt and oil-stained jeans seem befitting of his life on the farm. He peers out from a camouflage hat, the fuzzy ear flaps pulled up over his head. He speaks in an accent as thick as the mud on his boots. His hands speak to decades of hard labor. His fingers appear swollen with overworked muscles. The skin seems about a quarter-inch thick. If his hands could speak, he says, ""They'd be crying, instead of talking, for what they've been through."" ""You see how rusty and rough they are. They've been through something, ain't they?"" At 6-foot, 2-inches and 214 pounds, Presley has what seems an odd nickname. ""They call me Little Man,"" he says. He wears the nickname with pride. The youngest of three sisters and four brothers, he says that after his father died in 1935, he became the ""Little Man"" of the house. ""I was tall, but I was small. So they called me Little Man,"" he says. He doesn't remember much about his father. He can't recall the day he died or the sound of his voice. He was too young. He never met his slave grandparents either. They died long before he was born. But the fact they were slaves still stings. ""That doesn't make you feel too good, you know, to be sold like a cow. But back then, they couldn't help it. So I reckon I'm just glad that things come out better like it is now."" A thick fog hangs over the fields on this day. Presley pauses. He scans the fields and says, ""I think about the good times and the hard times."" ""When I started farming, we planted with hands ... and hauled it to the gin by wagon, a mule and a wagon. One bale at a time,"" he says. He worked the fields when he was 6, the age of a typical kindergartner these days. ""I was making 50 cents a day, from sunup to sundown."" ""Back then, you know, I didn't get no schooling. I had to get out, come home and break the land, cut the stalks, plow the land and get it ready for the crop."" Presley has a total of four years of education, classes that he took in between growing seasons. His mother taught him to read and write, but he admits even to this day he struggles with both. When it comes to life as a black man -- a sharecropper -- in Mississippi, he says it's tough to explain how difficult it was. He points to a nearby bluff and says that when he was just a boy, a black man was lynched from a tree. ""I never saw him hanging up there,"" he says. ""All I seen was the tree."" Blacks were segregated from whites. They couldn't go to the same schools. They had separate water fountains. Blacks couldn't go in the front doors of businesses. And just about everywhere you went, he says, racism was rampant. ""You go into a place, and they say, 'Nigger, get outta here.' You don't want nobody telling you that. You're a citizen around town. If you're a citizen, I'm a citizen like you,"" he says. ""It makes you feel mighty bad."" ""When I was a young boy, they was bad about that, calling you that."" He registered to vote for the first time in 1959 and cast his first presidential ballot for Kennedy. He says he's voted in every presidential election ever since. ""We felt like we were moving on up when we voted for him,"" he says. When Kennedy was assassinated, ""everybody was kind of sad on that day, because he looked like the first president that had come in and was trying to help the poor folks."" King brought hope, too. ""He was the only hope that we were looking for -- to bring us out,"" Presley says. But when King was killed on April 4, 1968, he says, it ""put us right back where we was."" ""It was pitiful that day,"" he says. ""Everybody around here was in mourning."" He says Obama has brought inspiration to blacks in these parts, the likes of which hasn't been seen since 1968. ""With Obama coming in, it's gonna be another Martin Luther King helping us,"" he says. ""Maybe in the next 40 years, we'll be better off."" He says Americans should never take their voting rights for granted. He was 30 years old before he first voted. ""It means a lot to me, because I can put in for who I want to be president and who not to be president,"" he says. ""So I just feel proud that I can vote."" Before parting on this day, Presley gives a tour of the weather-beaten, four-bedroom house where he raised his 13 children and six grandkids. The wood-framed house was the first home he ever lived in with running water, a bathroom and electric stove. The now-abandoned house is dilapidated, many of its windows broken, its doors barely hanging on hinges. ""I've had a good life, despite the hard times. I sure did,"" says Presley, who is retiring after 72 years of working the fields. What's his message to the world? ""The important thing in life is to try to live and do the best you can,"" he says. ""We done had it bad. Let us help give our children a better life, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. Let's try to give them a better life than we had. But anyway, just keep the good work going, is all I say.""",0.67023426,1567
100,"(CNN) -- After a nearly decade-long effort, the National Congress of Black Women on Tuesday honored Sojourner Truth by making her the first African-American woman to have a memorial bust in the U.S. Capitol. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and first lady Michelle Obama applaud the unveiling of the Sojourner Truth bust. Truth, whose given name was Isabella Baumfree, was a slave who became one of the most respected abolitionists and women's rights activists. ""One could only imagine what Sojourner Truth, an outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is kind of woman ... what she would have to say about this incredible gathering,"" first lady Michelle Obama said at the Celebration of Truth ceremony. ""We are all here because, as my husband says time and time again, we stand on the shoulders of giants like Sojourner Truth."" ""And just as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott would be pleased to know that we have a woman serving as the speaker of the House of Representatives, I hope that Sojourner Truth would be proud to see me, a descendant of slaves, serving as the first lady of the United States of America,"" she said. Dignitaries and congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, House Republican Leader John Boehner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, attended the ceremony marking the unveiling of the statue. Along with musical performances, actress Cicely Tyson recited ""Ain't I A Woman,"" Truth's famous 1851 speech to a women's rights convention. Clinton and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who worked together to draft legislation to commission the bust, were among speakers who paid tribute to the late C. Delores Tucker, former chairwoman of the NCBW, who spearheaded the effort for the Truth memorial. ""What a wonderful day it is to be here in Emancipation Hall for this great occasion when Sojourner Truth takes her rightful place alongside the heroes who have helped to shape our nation's history,"" Clinton said. ""Today, she takes her place in this Capitol, and we are the better for it,"" Clinton said. ""She is a sojourner of truth, by truth, and for truth. And her words, her example and her legacy will never perish from this earth, so long as men and women stand up and say loudly and clearly, 'We hear you echoing down through the years of history. We believe that your journey is not yet over, and we will make the rest of that journey with you.' "" The bronze statue, which was crafted by Los Angeles, California, sculptor Artis Lane, will stand in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. ""All the visitors in the U.S. Capitol will hear the story of brave women who endured the greatest of humanity's indignities. They'll hear the story of Sojourner Truth, who didn't allow those indignities to destroy her spirit, who fought for her own freedom and then used her powers ... to help others,"" Michelle Obama said. ""The power of this bust will not just be in the metal that delineates Sojourner Truth's face; it will also be in the message that defines her legacy. Forevermore, in the halls of one of our country's greatest monuments of liberty and equality, justice and freedom, Sojourner Truth's story will be told again and again and again and again."" In 1997, Congress passed a special act that called for relocating the Portrait Monument from the Capitol basement to the rotunda. The 7.5-ton statue depicts three leaders of the suffragette movement -- Anthony, Stanton and Mott. A group called the Sojourner Truth Crusade was upset about the statue's relocation because it didn't incorporate Truth. After Congress agreed to go ahead with a move, advocates proposed commissioning a new statue that would include Truth. In 2006, Congress passed a bill to honor the abolitionist with her own memorial.",0.6701429,3438
101,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- One of America's pre-eminent political power couples made a rare joint appearance Friday, when Bill and Hillary Clinton took the stage at the former president's Clinton Global Initiative conference. Bill Clinton says his wife Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the ""best public service our family has ever produced."" ""I want to begin by expressing my extreme indebtedness to the Clinton Global Initiative, to all of you who participated, for giving me the first chance I have had in a week to see Hillary,"" Bill Clinton told the audience of social activists and business leaders at the closing session of CGI, a week-long conference designed to find solutions to global problems through public and private partnerships. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was at the session to unveil a new State Department initiative on food security. As he introduced her, the former president was effusive in his praise for his wife, saying that her approach to food security -- helping farmers around the world grow their own food to earn income and alleviate poverty -- was much smarter than the decades-long policy of simply giving humanitarian aid and food to countries.

""It won't surprise you to hear that I am very proud of my husband, and I think what he has invented and brought to life here is extraordinary,"" she said, adding that the new State Department food initiative, in part, was an idea she developed by seeing the kinds of partnerships the Clinton Global Initiative produced. The Clintons posed for a photo-op with State Department officials and executives from General Mills and other organizations, who pledged at the conference to start a program to help farmers around the world. And then, for fans of the former first couple, a rare treat. As she walked off the stage, Bill Clinton drew some more cheers when he gave his wife a kiss.

102,"LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas (CNN) -- Carlotta Walls LaNier points out the only two African-Americans in her senior class as she flips through her high school yearbook. She pauses when she sees the picture on a page dedicated to ""Integration."" Carlotta Walls LaNier and eight other members of the Little Rock Nine are invited to Obama's inauguration. It's been nearly five decades since LaNier graduated from Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. ""It shows how the 101st were on the grounds of the school,"" says LaNier. In 1957, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, an elite Army unit, escorted LaNier and eight other African-American students into the all-white public high school. The students, who became known as the Little Rock Nine, were taunted and threatened by an angry mob. ""We knew we could not participate in extracurricular activities,"" recalls LaNier. ""There was one who could have been in the band, one who could have been on track. I was the one who played basketball ... I couldn't do that."" Back then, LaNier thought once the doors of equality were open it wouldn't be long before an African-American became president. ""I had hoped to see something like that in the next 10 or 15 years when I was in high school but that didn't happen,"" says LaNier. What has happened is a new generation of students walks the halls at Central High. Even though the exterior looks the same as it did during integration -- the interior would be almost unrecognizable to LaNier and the other Little Rock Nine.  Student: I can't believe it happened here, but I'm glad it did » . Today, the sea of mostly white faces has disappeared. The hallways are now filled with a more racially diverse student body. Students take a class to learn about the school's history and many say it's given them a greater appreciation for racial tolerance. ""Now it's definitely hard to imagine -- you walk into the halls and you see people of all different races are in the hallway. And in addition, the majority of our school is African-American now,"" points out Afshar Sanati, student body president. ""It is hard for me to walk inside the school every day and see how this place could have been such a hostile environment for nine African-American students."" LaNier is still humble when she reflects on her experience. ""We all knew that we were giving up something for a bigger cause and [we were] happy that we did it,"" says LaNier. ""Because it has been 51 years, I think they were baby steps now. But they were big steps then."" The steps taken by the Little Rock Nine were so big, in fact, they received personal invitations to attend President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration. ""I think the Little Rock Nine set the foundation,"" says student Sarah Karney. ""I don't think [Obama's election] could have happened without them."" Today, many students at Central High see themselves as the beneficiaries of an Obama presidency. ""Him being president means there actually is a chance for anyone to do what they want to do if they work hard enough,"" says Helena Liu, who says she doesn't see race when she looks at Obama. ""It doesn't depend on your race -- it depends on who you are, the quality of your character,"" says DeIvory Howard. ""[We've] got to get past just the color of our skins being newsworthy. It's really about all the things we knew we could do for this country and now we have the opportunity to show it and it's going to come through his leadership,"" says LaNier. ""And, we're looking forward to that."" Senior Chris Bell couldn't agree more. ""This election proves that this America is just not the old America.

104,"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama's transition team announced several key appointments to his communications team Saturday. Robert Gibbs will have one of the most highly visible roles in the Obama administration. Robert Gibbs, an Obama campaign spokesman who also has acted as spokesman for the transition, will become Obama's press secretary, one of the most highly visible roles in the administration. Gibbs, an Auburn, Alabama, native who has worked for Sen. Fritz Hollings, the Democratic Senatorial Committee and Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign, was communications director and then a senior strategist for the Obama campaign. Ellen Moran, executive director of EMILY's List, will serve as Obama's communications director. Moran worked for the AFL-CIO, coordinating ""Wal-Mart corporate accountability activities,"" before returning to EMILY's, an organization dedicated to helping Democratic women get elected to office. It had endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton for president.  See who's on Obama's short list for cabinet posts » . Dan Pfeiffer, current communications director with the transition team, will be Obama's deputy communications director. He began work with the Obama campaign in January 2007 as traveling press secretary before returning to Chicago, Illinois, to work as communications director. Unlike Gibbs and Pfeiffer, Moran is not already on Obama's communications team. ""These individuals will fill essential roles, and bring a breadth and depth of experience that can help our administration advance prosperity and security for the American people,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""This dedicated and impressive group of public servants includes longtime advisors and a talented new addition to our team, and together we will work to serve our country and meet the challenges of this defining moment in history."" On Friday, sources indicated that some of Obama's Cabinet posts were close to being filled. Two sources close to the transition team said New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner is ""on track"" to be offered the Treasury secretary post.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper discuss Obama's choices » . Transition officials told The Associated Press on Saturday that Obama planned to announce Geithner's appointment on Monday, along with that of Lawrence Summers as director of the National Economic Council. Summers is a former president of Harvard University and served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton. Two sources said Friday that Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is a serious contender for commerce secretary but that he could be chosen for another senior post. Geithner has played a large role in the government's efforts to wrangle the credit crisis, which has damaged markets and economies worldwide. Although a number of those efforts have been controversial, Geithner remains a well-regarded figure from Wall Street to Washington. Geithner began working with the Treasury Department in 1988 in the International Affairs division. In 1999, he became under-secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. Geithner would be charged with restoring stability to the financial markets, the banking system and the housing sector through oversight of the controversial $700 billion financial rescue package, of which about half is still available for use at the discretion of the Treasury secretary.  Watch CNN's John King discuss the posts with panelists » . The Dow Jones industrial index staged a late rally Friday after traders heard news of Geithner's possible appointment, rising by almost 500 points shortly before the market's closing time. The two sources close to the transition team said they do not consider Richardson's appointment to the Commerce Department to be a done deal. Richardson, 61, was a candidate for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Currently in his second term as New Mexico's governor, he served as ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration. Richardson is also considered to be a possibility for the secretary of state post. Also Friday, Sen. Hillary Clinton's camp shot down reports that she had agreed to accept the secretary of state position. ""We're still in discussions, which are very much on track,"" said Philippe Reines, Clinton's senior adviser. ""Any reports beyond that are premature."" The New York Times reported that Clinton would give up her Senate seat and accept the Cabinet post, citing two confidants, who said the decision was made after further consultation with Obama about the nature of her role and his foreign policy plans. A senior Obama aide told CNN there has been no development on a possible Clinton appointment since they informed CNN Thursday that she is ""on track"" to be nominated for secretary of state. Obama's transition team also appears close to choosing a national security adviser to the White House. Retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones has emerged as the president-elect's leading choice for the position, two sources close to the Obama transition team say. The sources said Jones has been given the impression by Obama that the job is his if he wants it. But the officials said that private discussions are under way and that no final decision has been made. The discussions are focused on precisely how much power Jones will have in the staff job, since he is used to being in a command role. Among his many posts, Jones served for several years as the operational commander for NATO.",0.6665449,7553
105,"To: Interested Parties From: John King Re: Monday Memo . Egyptain President Hosni Mubarak will visit the White House on Tuesday. (CNN) -- Health care remains, without a doubt, President Obama's top priority, though the week ahead will bring more of a public focus on international and security issues. One key dynamic to keep an eye on is the reaction among leading House Democrats to the latest indication the White House is prepared to accept a health care bill that lacks a robust ""public"" or government insurance option. ""Not the essential element,"" is how Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius described the public option to us on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.. ""Very difficult,"" is how veteran House Democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas told us when asked how hard of a sell a health care bill absent a robust public option would be in among House Democrats. This might be a good time for Obama and former President Clinton to swap notes about 1993-94. Out of the box on Monday in Phoenix, Arizona, Obama addresses the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention. It's a platform to share his views on the escalation of the U.S. commitment in Afghanistan just as U.S. forces begin to quicken their pace of withdrawal from Iraq. Back in Washington on Tuesday, a White House meeting with longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will turn attention to the Middle East, where the administration and traditional Arab allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia are unhappy with the lack of discernible movement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And Thursday's national elections in Afghanistan will keep a spotlight on the international stage and the uncertainties facing the Obama administration. It's safe to say the White House has profound worries about President Hamid Karzai's commitment to fight corruption and lead aggressively, but it's also safe to say the White House expectation is another Karzai term. The market closed down at the end of last week because of doubts the worst was over.

106,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- At 80, Maya Angelou says her ""knees are not all that swift and my lungs need some extra help but other than that, my desire to learn and to share, that has not abated."" Maya Angelou urges politicians to ""aim for the high ground"" in her new book, ""Letter to My Daughter."" She shares what she's learned in an eventful life in her best-selling new book, ""Letter to My Daughter."" Angelou achieved fame for her autobiographical writing, including ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" and her poetry. She read her poem ""On the Pulse of Morning"" at President Clinton's first inauguration. She was only the second poet invited to read at the swearing in of a new president. But her career has had many facets -- Angelou has been a singer, dancer, playwright, director and teacher. In 166 pages, ""Letter to My Daughter"" distills stories from Angelou's life into universal lessons. She writes about birth, life and death, about the ways people misunderstand each other and then transcend their conflict. She calls on national leaders to raise the country's spirit and on Americans to remember that this is the nation that defeated the Nazis and expanded people's freedom through the civil rights movement. ""Politicians must set their aims for the high ground and according to our various leanings, Democratic, Republican, Independent, we will follow,"" she writes. ""Politicians must be told if they continue to sink into the mud of obscenity, they will proceed alone."" In an interview last week in her 1881 brownstone in Harlem, decorated in vibrant, bright colors, Angelou sat at the round table in her dining room, sipping coffee, as she talked about the election and her work. She supported Sen. Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination and then backed Sen. Barack Obama once the primaries were over. CNN: In the chapter called ""National Spirit,"" you call on political leaders to raise the level of discussion. Could you elaborate on that? Maya Angelou: What I've encouraged voters to do is to vote for the person I am extolling, and also don't expect that if your man or woman gets in, that all things will be rectified immediately. It's taken us a long time to come to this place of weariness and almost hopelessness. So because Obama gets in or McCain gets in, it's not going to be repaired overnight. The economy is not going to be repaired, the schools -- the disaster in our schools -- will not be repaired overnight. Nor will the social conversation be repaired overnight. However, I would encourage every voter to say to his or her candidate, go in and do it, and you will not do it alone. I will help. You have to get up off that sofa or off that couch and give something to the country -- even if it's one hour every other week to an old people's home -- I will read, go into the children's ward and read, or give to your church or your synagogue or your mosque. ... Offer something to the country. So you don't just sit there. CNN: What does it say about the country that Barack Obama is a candidate to be president? Angelou: The country is growing up and confessing to something we've known all along. What prevented us from admitting that we knew that? And I was taken back to slavery. If you will have a person enslaved, the first thing you must do is convince yourself that the person is subhuman. The second thing you have to do is convince your allies so you'll have some help, and the third and probably unkindest cut of all is to convince that person that he or she is subhuman and deserves it. Well, such a job has been done on all of us that people found it very difficult to admit that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. We've known it. But to admit it, you have to stop saying because this guy speaks another language, because their eyes are shaped differently from mine, because they're first-generation Americans from Eastern Europe, then they don't count, I don't have to consider them. With this, the country is finally able to see through complexion and see community. CNN: You've known and worked with people like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Could you imagine what their reaction would be to this? Angelou: I think everybody would be weeping tears of joy really. I think of my grandmother who raised me. She was a daughter of a former slave. She knew this was going to happen. You know that when I was young, I was physically abused and so I stopped talking. I thought that my voice had killed the criminal. ... The man had been found dead. Police said he had been beaten to death. So I knew, because I told [people] that he did it, that my voice could just go out and kill people. So after a few months, my mother's people sent me and my brother back to this little village in Arkansas to my grandmother, my father's mother who was raising me, and she used to braid my hair. My hair was huge and very curly, black. And my grandmother put her hand behind my neck and held it so she wouldn't break my neck by accident. And she would start to brush my hair and she would say, ""Sister, Mama don't care what these people say about you, that you must be an idiot, you must be a moron because you can't talk. Mama know when you and the good Lord get ready, you're going to teach all over this world. You're going to be a mighty teacher."" I didn't speak for six years. She said that to me all the time, in this little village in Arkansas. [Now] I teach all over the world, I teach in French and Spanish, so when I stand up on a stage or see a book of mine gets accolades or a piece of music I've written, I think about my Mama, and she died before I really came of age, and I just think she knew it. CNN: She was prophetic about you, but beyond that? Angelou: Yes, [she believed] it will get better. And you have to continue to prepare yourself, continue to build yourself, continue to elevate yourself and be a benefit, be a blessing rather than a curse, and things will get better. And they have, so when I think of Dr. King and Malcolm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Medgar Evers, I also think of Chief Albert Luthuli, one of the first Africans to earn the Nobel Prize. I mean that after Chief Luthuli, apartheid was so rigid, unbreakable that men had to carry their IDs on plastic cards that were too large for any suit, so they flapped, reminding them constantly who they were. It was my blessing to meet Nelson Mandela before he went into prison and I've seen him many times since. He knew this day would come, and to be able to stay in prison for 27 years, knowing that the day would come. CNN: What gave you the inspiration to call the book, ""Letter to My Daughter,"" even though you don't have a daughter? [Angelou has a son, the writer Guy Johnson.] . Angelou: There was an African-American poet, her name was Anne Spencer; she wrote a poem called ""Letter to My Sister,"" around the turn of the 20th Century. ... I started making notes to Oprah [Winfrey] about 20 years ago. She really became a daughter to me. So there were things I wanted to talk to her about; I made notes, copious notes, and about a year and a half ago, I got out that box called WIP, works in progress, and I started going through two or three lines and I said, ""Hmmm, there's an essay in here."" So it is a letter to all my daughters, to those who don't know they are. It is my intent to say you may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. You will be changed, events will change you, but you have to decide not to be reduced. CNN: Have you been in touch with Oprah lately about the election? Angelou: I spoke to her about a week ago ... [During the primaries], a newspaper reporter said this proves that Oprah Winfrey doesn't listen to everything Maya Angelou says, because she was supporting Sen. Obama and I was supporting Sen. Clinton. And when I was asked by the reporter, ""What do you say to Oprah?"" my answer was, ""I say nothing, she's a woman who thinks carefully and profoundly and she has courage. So she's chosen the person she thinks would be the best person for our country. I do the same."" The primaries proved that Oprah had selected the one that most people wanted, so I went to Sen. Obama right after that. Hillary Clinton ... telephoned me and thanked me for my unwavering support, and then asked me to please put that same energy behind Mr. Obama. CNN: Another theme in the book is to believe in yourself, to have faith in yourself. Why is that important? Angelou: You need to know that you can go somewhere. You're not just like grass growing on the street. You're like trees, you have roots, and they've done wonderful things, and you need to know that, and by knowing that, you see how outfitted you are for these times. And that you really owe it to those who went before so that you can add to them for those who are yet to come. You need to know that you are in a continuum, and if you understand that, you realize that you are worthwhile. This continuum would be broken without me.",0.6656332,4583
107,"Washington (CNN) -- Valerie Jarrett does not like to talk about herself. I know this because we've sat down on numerous occasions for interviews, going back to the early days of Barack Obama's presidential campaign. But this one was perhaps the most challenging because the focus was on her. She is fiercely loyal to Obama, as one of his closest friends. But she also advises him as president, with the title of Senior Adviser and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Liaison. The ultimate insider does not spill the beans. But doing a series on the power players inside the White House would not be complete without looking at Jarrett's role. She has called her relationship with the president a ""mind meld."" ""We're good friends who have known each other for a long time,"" Jarrett says. ""Eighteen years, you get a pretty good sense of him."" Her first sense of him came in 1991 when Obama was a young law professor in Chicago, Illinois. Jarrett was interviewing his fiancée, the future first lady, Michelle Robinson, for a job in Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's office. The protective partner, Obama, was making sure Jarrett was on the up and up. Jarrett first explained the scene when I interviewed her in May 2008. ""They sat next to each other and when she was speaking he would just look at her with this adoring look,""Jarrett said with a laugh, ""but he was really tough on me in the nicest possible way."" The three became fast friends. Now Obama says he runs every important decision by Jarrett, trusts her completely and considers her family. When I bring this to her attention she accepts her role humbly. ""Well, I hope he would trust me the way any close friend does. He knows I have his best interest at heart and that I understand, because I'm part of the administration, the myriad of challenges he faces,"" Jarrett says. ""So I hope he views me a sounding board, someone who's going to be honest, direct and candid with him at all times."" She laughs when I suggest perhaps she is his consigliere. ""You can tell I'm uncomfortable with this,"" she says when I try to get her to focus more on her role. She does not like to be singled out from the rest of the White House team. Instead she paints a picture of what it would be like if I were in an Oval Office meeting with the president. ""When everyone's done talking, if there've been a couple of people who've been quiet, he'll say, 'Well, Suzanne, what do you think of this issue?' "" Jarrett says. She describes his style in running the meetings as ""accommodating."" ""He reads people very well. He's extraordinarily perceptive. He can tell from the body language if someone is uncomfortable with something,"" Jarrett says. But she can also read the president's body language when he's heard enough talk. ""He's not moody, but you can tell when he's ready for a conversation to end,"" Jarrett says. ""He enjoys making sure there is robust debate, but when he's finished with debate he's finished. He's ready to move on. So I can detect when enough is enough, let's bring in the next issue."" Jarrett says newcomers to the administration have pulled her aside to get her take on how things were going. ""Particularly early on, people who didn't know the president as well as I did would come to me after a meeting and say 'What did he really mean? I know he said this, but what is he really thinking?' and I took such delight in being able to say he meant exactly what he said. That's who he is."" It's the intangibles that Jarrett sometimes brings to the table. ""People are always looking for the hidden intent, the body language, and he is about as straight a shooter as you're going to ever come across. So I think part of what I do is go around and give people some comfort to really trust what he said. He meant exactly what he said. You can take him at face value."" Jarrett says the president does not make deals after his meetings are done. People don't trail him through the back door trying to change his mind. ""That's just not the way he operates,"" Jarrett says. ""He likes to hear from everybody at the same time. Then he makes a decision."" Jarrett's job includes acting as a liaison to the business community and conducting outreach to African-American groups. But it's her role as confidante to the president that makes her the ultimate insider. Jarrett sits in on Obama's daily briefings in the morning that deal with national security and the economy. She also attends policy meetings regarding the president's agenda on health care, energy and education. She facilitates and hosts small groups of CEOs to have lunch with Obama. And she heads the Office of Public Engagement as the president's contact with outside groups. Jarrett says she also spends ""a good deal of time"" with Michelle Obama both personally and professionally. Part of her portfolio is working closely with the first lady's team, ""making sure there's seamless interaction between the East and West Wings."" Jarrett occupies the office previously used by Karl Rove and former first lady Hillary Clinton. She is often the only woman in the room in briefings with the president. But she dismisses talk of tension with ""the boys,"" as some of the male power players are referred to in the White House. ""We really do pull together as a team,"" Jarrett says. While Jarrett's ability to freelance as the president's senior adviser has rankled some, Jarrett says being inside the circle of power is a ""warm"" and ""inclusive"" environment. As for Obama's all-male pickup basketball games, Jarrett says that's not where the real power resides. ""I think what's really important is who does the president surround himself with and give substantial responsibilities to."" Jarrett's got plenty of responsibility. Her challenge is separating her friendship with the president from her job. Often she takes her cues from where she stands. ""If we're in the Oval Office, I call him ""Mr. President."" It's very formal. I think it's appropriate. It's not just deferential to him but to the office,"" Jarrett says. ""I really try to compartmentalize our friendship and what my role is outside the office, and my role as senior adviser."" When I ask her if that's a difficult thing to do, requiring her to flip a switch, she says ""no."" She says when she's in the Oval Office, they're all about business, outside, ""everything but business."" ""The one thing I don't do is try to mix the two. I don't try to be his friend when we're having a business conversation and I try not to burden him with office issues when trying to have downtime,"" Jarrett says. When they're hanging out as friends, it's often indulging in their favorite pastime. ""We like to eat,"" Jarrett says with a hearty laugh. ""He's a healthy eater. I'm not. We have a lot of wonderful conversations around the dinner table -- something we've always enjoyed."" But now that dinner table is in the White House. The movies they enjoy watching, they now take in at the White House movie theater. But despite that, Jarrett insists her longtime friend is the same. She says what she finds ""so appealing"" is he's still ""grounded."" ""He has a very good sense of self, he's steady. His temperament is very predictable,"" she says. A year after Obama captured the White House, Jarrett is still in awe. ""Not a day goes by I don't pinch myself and treasure this experience and opportunity to serve this president who also happens to be my friend.""",0.6654379,7200
108,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama weighed in Thursday on the conflict between Israel and Hamas, urging Israel to open Gaza border crossings and telling the Islamic fundamentalist organization to stop rocket fire into the Jewish state. President Obama called on both Israel and Hamas to make changes toward Mideast peace. He urged Israel to allow the flow of aid and commerce into the Palestinian territory. ""Our hearts go out to Palestinian civilians who are in need of immediate food, clean water and basic medical care,"" he said. The crossings should be opened with an ""appropriate monitoring,"" he added. Obama said Hamas leaders, for their part, must put an end to rocket attacks. He said he will send former Sen. George Mitchell, who was appointed Thursday as special envoy for Middle East peace, to the region as soon as possible. Earlier, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived at her new office in the State Department, promising a renewed emphasis on candor and ""robust diplomacy"" as the primary means for advancing American interests around the world. America's new chief diplomat walked through the front doors of the State Department lobby shortly after 9 a.m. ET to thunderous applause from an overflow crowd of about 1,000 career diplomats and other department employees. ""I believe with all of my heart that this is a new era for America,"" Clinton told her colleagues. ""President Obama set the tone with his inaugural address. ... Robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America's future.""  Watch Clinton greet her new employees » . In remarks that could be interpreted as a rebuke of the departed Bush administration, Clinton also said that the Obama administration would not ""tolerate the divisiveness and paralysis that has undermined our ability to get things done for America."" Clinton also called for a new sense of candor and free exchange of ideas. She urged the country's diplomatic corps to think ""outside the proverbial box."" ""There's nothing I welcome more than a good debate and the kind of dialogue that will make us better,"" she said. Clinton later attended an intelligence briefing and a meeting with members of the Diplomatic Security Service. She also walked through various State Department offices, including the operations center. Clinton also phoned international leaders, according to acting State Department spokesman Robert Wood. She is expected to call Asian leaders later Thursday. Clinton will also visit the U.S. Agency for International Development, which she praised ""for the work they've done on behalf of development through some very difficult years."" During her confirmation hearing, Clinton pledged to secure more resources for the State Department and USAID, which has seen a lot of its development work fall to the Pentagon during the Bush administration.

109,"Washington (CNN) -- While administrations come and go, and power in Congress teeters between political parties, one thing remains constant in the lives of Washington, D.C.'s, elite: the power lunch. Between noon and 2 p.m., brokers meet to clinch deals, with the emphasis more on power than on lunch. Just steps from Capitol Hill, Charlie Palmer is one of the places to see and be seen at lunchtime. Depending on the week, the modern American steakhouse serves between 70 and 80 congressmen and between 20 and 30 senators. ""I'd bet we've had every member of Congress and every senator in the restaurant at some point,"" says Matt Hill, executive chef for the famed eatery. It's not just the proximity to Capitol Hill that draws Washington's elite to Charlie Palmer. The restaurant has several private dining areas -- including a rooftop with scenic views of the city -- and an executive chef who prides himself on serving homemade, inventive fare. ""We do anything, we've got senators from Hawaii that come in, and they ask for Hawaiian hors d'oeurves, we've got, you know, people from Texas that ask for things from Texas,"" Hill says. ""So, we can really vary the menu, and it makes it interesting for me to try to come up with new ideas."" Thirty-seven years ago, Tommy Jacomo moved to Washington with his brother and built The Palm with his bare hands. Now, as executive director of the famed power spot, Jacomo is known by Washington's elite as the keeper of the keys to The Palm. Everyone knows him. ""It's pretty frightening, yeah, you can't even walk down the street sometimes, Jacomo said. ""People say, 'Hey, Tommy! Put me down for two at 12:30,' and I don't even know who the hell they are."" The Palm has hosted every president from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. President Obama has yet to make a visit. But it's not just presidents who visit The Palm. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has frequented the restaurant since the Clinton administration. Cabinet secretaries including Madeleine Albright, administration officials, senators and representatives, Supreme Court justices, the city's top lobbyists, lawyers, strategists and media elites are all regulars at the Dupont Circle steakhouse. And if you become a regular, you get your picture on the wall. ""People used to think when we first opened up that we had all the [portraits of] Republicans on one side and all the [portraits of] Democrats on the other side,"" Jacomo said. ""It's not really as much thought behind it. It just goes up, it's good customers, loyal customers, famous people, infamous people, and I decide where I want to put them when I get the chance,"" he joked, pointing out the minimal space left on the wall. Not everyone is willing to put their picture on the wall. James Carville and Mary Matalin, who are political strategists and CNN contributors, chose to have their dogs' portraits on the wall instead of their own. While steakhouses remain a favorite, not all power restaurants dish out filet mignon. Steps from the White House are three of Washington's oldest power spots: The Oval Room, which serves up American fare; Bombay Club, which is Indian; and Old Ebbitt Grille, which also specializes in American cuisine. Cafe Milano, in Georgetown, and The Monocle and Johnny's Half Shell, on Capitol Hill, also remain abuzz with some of the most prominent people in Washington. Italian restaurant Posto on 14th Street has become a favorite among younger administration staffers because of its laid-back atmosphere and expansive dining room. Posto's sister restaurant Tosca, owned by Paolo Sacco, has kept D.C.'s top lobbyists and politicians coming back since it opened in 2001. Not only known for the power scene and homemade Italian cuisine, Tosca has set itself apart from others by having some of the most attentive waitstaff in the city. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, known by friends as a big foodie, has dined at Tosca, as have Emanuel and Obama adviser David Axelrod. The Washington Post reported that former Sen. Tom Daschle convinced then-freshman Sen. Obama to run for president at the Italian eatery. The newest member of the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, is known by friends as a ""very adventurous diner."" She is a fan of Lebanese Taverna, in Woodley Park, which serves up Middle Eastern fare. Serving up inventive sushi dishes like a fish-and-chips roll, or wasabi guacamole with wonton chips, SEI in Penn Quarter has established itself as a newcomer to the power scene, along with its neighbors Rasika and Oyamel -- all reported to have recently hosted first lady Michelle Obama. ""One of the things that's been sort of fun to watch over the course of this year is the Obamas have eaten out in a wide variety of places,"" says Garrett Graff,  editor of Washingtonian magazine. ""You've seen them come and get burgers up here on the Hill, you've seen them go out for burgers in Virginia, you've also seen them go out to some of the nicest restaurants in the city, like Citronelle and Blue Duck Tavern, where they went this fall for their anniversary dinner. But then you see Barack eating on his own -- he's going to a place like Ben's Chili Bowl or he's going to a place like Ray's Hell Burger."" Graff points out one top restaurant at which the Obamas have yet to dine. ""They still haven't been to what is widely considered to be the city's best restaurant, which is a small Greek place near Dupont Circle called Komi,"" Graff said. ""But one of the challenges with a place like Komi is that it's very small and books up far in advance, so it might be hard for the Obamas to sort of drop in there like they've been dropping in at a lot of these other restaurants.""",0.66397846,8705

Sanchez is CEO of the Impacto Group, which specializes in market research about women and Hispanics. Leslie Sanchez says Michelle Obama's fashion choices have helped create a positive image for the first lady. (CNN) -- In just 200 days, Michelle Obama has put her own stamp on one of America's most unusual political positions -- the unelected, undefined job of being first lady. And the way she's done it? It's largely through the fashion choices she's made. Each of her predecessors has brought a unique perspective and personality to the east wing of the White House, helping to shape how the nation views the president and how the world views the nation. The use of fashion and image as a political strategy is an underrated factor. While Washington's political cognoscenti debate the successes and failures of the young Obama presidency, one half of Washington's newest power couple fine tunes fashion as a political strategy -- and it's working for her.  See photos of Michelle Obama's fashion » . The fashion authorities who are gathered this week in New York for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, more than seven months into the Obama presidency, are watching Michelle Obama's redefinition of the role of first lady with professional and personal interest. The contemporary standard for the job was set decades ago by Jacqueline Kennedy, who had both a high sense of fashion and the style to pull it off. Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the historian at the National First Ladies' Library, points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed, liked European style and had American designers copy it. She even went as far as to personally design her own outfits on three important state occasions, including her famous White House dinner for Nobel laureates, while letting other designers take the credit. The comparisons between Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Obama are as apt as the comparisons between their husbands. Michelle Obama comes across as feminine yet strong, professional and, unlike Mrs. Kennedy, approachable. She's a thoughtful presence on the national stage, but it's a very different kind of style from what we associate with Jackie Kennedy, who displayed a style of wealth, youth and glamor to an adoring middle class. Mrs. Obama, on the other hand, is portrayed as a take-charge woman who is sensitive to today's economic realities. Not stylish in her own right, she blends advice from her noted advisers to appear independent and progressive, yet ""in touch."" But while Jackie was high fashion, Michelle Obama is trendy but traditional. And that approachability extends to her personal style as well, her advisors having absorbed the lesson that the first lady's style is all too easily linked to her husband's presidency. Ronald Reagan's opponents used his wife Nancy's interest in fashion and her intent to look like the wife of a president, rather than mimic the school-marmish attire of her predecessor, as a gateway through which to attack the president. Mrs. Reagan's wardrobe choices, especially her designer Adolfo dresses, were used to make her husband seem insensitive to the poor and hungry. Mrs. Obama has avoided making the same mistake during the worst economic times in recent memory. She seems to have made a calculated decision to avoid that trap by focusing on emerging designers, like Jason Wu for her inaugural gown or choosing to wear trendy, off-the-rack clothes like the J. Crew gloves, sweater and skirt she chose for her husband's inauguration. And whatever the style mavens have to say about that, it produces political benefits. J. Crew's shares jumped 10 percent within 24 hours after the nation saw her in its clothing, which prompted NBC's Conan O'Brien to suggest the president consider wearing a Buick. As Women's Wear Daily media reporter Stephanie Smith says, this child of Chicago's South Side has become ""the biggest celebrity in the world."" Forbes lists her among the ""Most Powerful Women,"" and there's no doubt she's expanding the boundaries of perceptions surrounding the role of a ""traditional"" first lady, balancing her visits to homeless shelters and military bases with taking part in her children's soccer games. As The New York Times reported, Mrs. Obama ""pointedly controlled her look on the covers of People, Essence, More and O, Oprah Winfrey's magazine. Editors at Essence, who suggested colors, styles and accessories, said her staff did not call to acknowledge their overtures. ... Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor-in-chief of More... said Mrs. Obama refused to wear anything other than her own clothes for their October cover. 'She wanted none of that. She was creating the cover. She was creating the image. There's definitely a will of steel there.'"" According to Anthony, the general public's fascination with Michelle Obama spills over and helps the administration. To him, everything the media and the public criticize or praise is visual. ""It's not anything she's saying or doing. That's perhaps somewhat tactical. If she's unpopular based on her clothes choices, the White House can say it's really not of importance."" IMG executive Fern Mallis, the creative inspiration behind New York's Fashion Week, says ""most first ladies have always been on a pedestal of expensive, elegant clothing, of couture evening gowns. It's something that people can't really relate to."" This was especially true during the Kennedy years. Even if most American women wanted Jackie's dresses, Anthony points out, they could not buy them. These clothes were not only too expensive -- they weren't even available at the high-end stores. They were one of a kind. Mrs. Obama, because she has made fashion ""more democratic,"" says style expert Robert Verdi, has made her own impact on a world full of elites and -- let's face it -- snobs. Mrs. Kennedy, he says, ""was very contemporary and up-to-the-moment in fashion. But fashion at that time as not democratic. There was no Zara, no J. Crew, no Banana Republic. It was not accessible; it was exclusively aspirational."" On balance, though, Michelle Obama has shown a feminine but bold approach to her style by rattling the image of what a ""Washington"" first lady must look like. For other professional women and moms, the impact may not be purely imitation, as was the case with Jackie Kennedy, but rather the timely embracing of a new image of a modern, professional woman. Whatever it is, it's clearly by design. The push-pull of knowing fashion and appropriately wearing fashion may take Mrs. Obama longer to manage. Though a risk-taker and eager to highlight the equivalent of ""mom and pop"" designers, she, like many women, is still safely wearing styles others create rather than something new we could aspire to. Still -- whatever the implications for fashion -- on a political level, the first lady's approach is working. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Sanchez.",0.66278565,7679
111,"CLARENCE CENTER, New York (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday praised Beverly Eckert, the widow of a September 11 victim and a prominent post-9/11 activist, who was one of the passengers who died in a plane crash outside Buffalo, New York. Sean Rooney and wife Beverly Eckert in an undated photograph. ""Beverly lost her husband on 9/11,"" Obama said, ""and became a tireless advocate for the families whose lives were forever changed on that September day."" A resident of Stamford, Connecticut, Eckert was the widow of Buffalo native Sean Rooney, who died at the World Trade Center. Obama's words underscored the shock and grief from friends, family and acquaintances over the news that Eckert was aboard the Continental Connection Flight 3407. The turboprop plane crashed Thursday, killing all 49 aboard and one person on the ground. ""Tragic events such as these remind us of the fragility of life and the value of every single day. And one person who understood that well was Beverly Eckert, who was on that flight and who I met with just a few days ago,"" Obama said in brief remarks. Obama met Eckert at a gathering of September 11 victims' families on Friday. Valerie Lucznikowska, a member of September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, said she, Eckert and another woman traveled to Washington for the meeting. Lucznikowska said Eckert asked Obama whether the group would have ongoing meetings with his administration. Obama said there would be, even though they wouldn't necessarily be with him. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, Eckert co-founded Voices of September 11, an advocate group for survivors and families. Eckert had a reputation as a strong campaigner of September 11 families, involved in protests leading to more land for a ground zero memorial, working on the September 11 Commission's Family Steering Committee and pushing for a victims' families compensation fund. She was traveling to Buffalo for a celebration of what would have been her husband's 58th birthday. Eckert planned to take part in presenting a scholarship award at Canisius High School that was established in honor of her late husband, who was an alumnus, according to the school's president, John Knight. Obama mentioned the scholarship plans in his remarks Friday. ""In keeping with that passionate commitment, she was on her way to Buffalo to mark what would have been her husband's birthday and launch a scholarship in his memory. She was an inspiration to me and to so many others, and I pray that her family finds peace and comfort in the hard days ahead,"" Obama said. Lucznikowska, whose nephew died in the World Trade Center attacks, said she was ""horribly saddened by this news."" ""I would very much like to honor her. She was truly a wonderful person. She was someone who was trying to make society better."" Eckert backed Peaceful Tomorrows' effort to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and end the military commissions there, Lucznikowska said. The group elaborated on this stance in a signed letter to Obama, and Eckert gave a presidential aide a separate letter listing her own concerns, Lucznikowska said. Knight said Canisius High postponed the scholarship presentation, set to occur at noon Friday, for two students entering the high school next fall. He said Eckert also had been active in a capital campaign fundraising effort. ""She struck me as a wonderful, beautiful person who clearly wanted to do something to remember her husband in a way that would have an everlasting impact on our community,"" Knight said. Gordon Felt, president of the Families of Flight 93 Inc., the plane that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on September 11, also expressed his grief. ""We note with deep sorrow the passing of Beverly Eckert in the Buffalo plane crash. She was a 9/11 family member who brought to light issues of importance to all of us -- and to all Americans. We extend our condolences to her family and to all those who loved her. She will be missed.""

I have been a photojournalist for the past 25 years and have had the incredible opportunity to witness many of modern history's defining moments: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, the end of apartheid in South Africa and Nelson Mandela walking out of prison in 1991, and most of the world's conflicts of the past three decades.  This moment means 'everything is possible' » . When our bus pulled into Maryland on the eve of the inauguration, I knew after hearing the words of my fellow passengers, in some sense fellow pilgrims, that I was in the midst of a moment of history like maybe no other I had ever witnessed -- certainly in terms of its historic magnitude, and certainly not in America. It is the words of these passengers, and those of many others that I have met in the past two days, that are representative to some degree of what this moment means.

Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. NATISHA LANCE, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A member of the military is making history. We'll explain how in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hi, everyone. Carl Azuz is off this week. I'm Natisha Lance. First Up: Afghan Crashes . LANCE: First up, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The countries share a border, and they also share a common problem: threats from militant groups and terrorists like the Taliban and al Qaeda. It's an issue facing both nations' governments, and one that the U.S. government is concerned about as well. That's why President Obama has been holding a series of meetings with some of his advisers. They're reviewing the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Samantha Hayes has the latest on those meetings and on the violence in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Two helicopter crashes make it the deadliest day in four years for Americans in Afghanistan. While a NATO security force spokesman says enemy fire is not to blame, the loss of 14 Americans comes while President Barack Obama is considering a request to send thousands more troops to the region to fight al Qaeda. The president addressed service men and women in Jacksonville, Florida Monday, after a White House meeting with his national security team. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Fourteen Americans gave their lives, and our prayers are with these service members, their civilian colleagues and the families who loved them. HAYES: The deadliest of the two crashes happened following a raid on suspected drug traffickers, and three DEA agents were among those killed. Also among the dead, three U.S. civilians, members of the embassy community. The State Department says the efforts of civilians and other nonmilitary personnel are essential to the overall mission. JACOB LEW, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: Improving Afghan governance, providing security, justice, jobs and services, and giving the Afghan people a meaningful alternative, as much as possible, to the Taliban's recruiting. HAYES: Democratic Senator John Kerry, off of a recent trip to the region, addressed those efforts and the U.S. relationship with the Afghan government in a Washington speech. SEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: The fact that the Afghan government has not prosecuted a single high level drug trafficker damages all of our efforts because it goes to the fundamental question of credibility. HAYES: President Obama's White House meeting was the sixth in a series of high-level discussions about what to do in Afghanistan, as the administration awaits results from that country's November 7th presidential runoff. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes. (END VIDEO) I.D. Me . CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in 1939 in Searchlight, Nevada. I was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, and I'm currently the Senate Majority Leader, which means I'm the highest ranking member of the Senate's majority party. I'm Harry Reid, a Democrat who is the senior senator from Nevada. Public Option . LANCE: And in that role as majority leader, it's Sen. Reid's job to help combine health care bills from different committees into a single bill that can be presented to the entire Senate. Yesterday, Sen. Reid announced that the combined bill will include a government-run health care program; what's been called the public option. During his announcement, Reid also said that the bill will let individual states choose not to take part in the public option. They would have until the year 2014 to make that decision. This has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate over health care reform. Critics argue that if companies use the public option, then some people might lose the health care coverage that they currently have and are happy with. But Sen. Reid believes it's an important part of the reform. SEN. HARRY REID, (D-NV) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I believe that the public option can achieve a goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system. It will protect consumers, keep insurers honest, ensure competition, and that's why we intend to include it in the bill that we submitted, that will be submitted to the Senate. Tea Party Protests . LANCE: Meanwhile, the Tea Party Express is back on the road, protesting issues like government involvement in health care. The Express, which is named for both the organization and its bus, launched a new tour Sunday in California with rallies in San Diego and Los Angeles, where some people actually showed up to protest the Tea Party protesters. The Express plans to hold demonstrations in dozens of cities over the next several weeks. One of the group's main goals is the push for less government involvement, and these rallies also aim to give people who feel that way an opportunity to express their views. CHRIS KEAYS, TEA PARTY PROTESTER: We need to get back to the days when we were responsible and we assumed the responsibility of ourselves and our families, and the government is not a part of my daily life. I really resent the government taking up so much of my time that I'm down here having to protest right now. New Jobs Outlook . LANCE: And some potentially good news for the U.S. economy: A new survey indicates that companies are planning to hire more employees in the very near future. The report from the National Association of Business Economics says for the first time since the recession started nearly two years ago, the number of employers planning to hire workers over the next six months is higher than the number of jobs that are expected to be cut during that same time. The country's current unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. That's the highest the statistic has been in more than a quarter century. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What base is home to the U.S. Army's Drill Sergeant School? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Fort Bragg, B) Fort Hood, C) Fort Jackson or D) Fort Knox? You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find the Army's Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Top Drill Sergeant . LANCE: Drill sergeants are responsible for training tens of thousands of soldiers every year. And the head of the Drill Sergeant School, its commandant, is responsible for training them. The current commandant broke new ground when she took over the position last month because she's the first she to head up the school. Jason Carroll introduces us to this trailblazing soldier. (BEGIN VIDEO) JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Historically, this is the image of the military drill sergeant: a tough guy. That was then; this is now. At 48, Command Sergeant Major Teresa King is the first woman to lead the Army's Drill Sergeant Training School. What are you looking for? I mean, because it all pretty much looks like everybody's exercising to me. CMD. SGT. MAJOR TERESA KING: I'm looking for attention to detail, conformance. CARROLL: Before sunrise at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, King readies her drill instructor candidates for a rigorous run. What's wrong with that? KING: That's too big, Top. You need to break it up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fall out! CARROLL: She leads by example. King runs the five-mile course from the front of the pack, outperforming men half her age. STAFF SGT. LERON DELANEY, U.S. ARMY: She's older than me, so if I fall out and she's still running, I feel bad. CARROLL: Extinguishing those who think a woman can't be commandant. SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL CHILDS, U.S. ARMY: We've got to stay on top of our game even more than we used to with her, because she's that sharp. CARROLL: King says she wakes up some mornings still shocked she is commandant. KING: I had never considered it, although I've been in training for about seven years. But I never considered it, the Drill Sergeant School. CARROLL: King's first Army job some 30 years ago was postal clerk, but her hero, General George Patton, inspired her. KING: I saw that he had the respect of his men. And I saw he was resolute. CARROLL: King eventually rose through the ranks, excelling at training infantry men and paratroopers alike. KING: I'm doing what I've always done. It's just now, people are paying attention to it. CARROLL: And to her opinions. The military prohibits women from serving in front line combat roles. King trains men for combat and thinks it's time to train qualified women. KING: I think if they can do it, they should be allowed to do it. CARROLL: The reality: Women make up 14 percent of active soldiers in the Army. Some women question how many others will follow in King's footsteps. OPERATIONS SGT. ANGELA ANDREWS, U.S. ARMY: I wouldn't say it opens the door, but it may crack it somewhat. CARROLL: King says she will continue to lead by example. KING: I have vision. And I believe I can cause people to do some things that they thought they never could do. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, some science projects can balloon out of control. Which was the whole point of this experiment in Indiana. College students filled this high altitude balloon with helium and then let it fly away. The thing actually climbed 90,000 feet before... awww. Looks like their bubble burst. Actually, they knew it would. The cameras and sensors inside the balloon gently parachuted back to the ground. So in the end, the experiment was a total success. Goodbye . AZUZ: Just don't tell that to the students. We wouldn't want them to get an inflated ego. That's all the time we have for today.

117,"(CNN) -- With record low approval ratings and intense criticism for his handling of the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and the economy, the word most used to label George W. Bush's presidency will be ""incompetent,"" historians say. President Bush makes remarks on the presidential transition November 6. ""Right now there is not a lot of good will among historians. Most see him as a combination of many negative factors,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. ""He is seen as incompetent in terms of how he handled domestic and foreign policy. He is seen as pushing for an agenda to the right of the nation and doing so through executive power that ignored the popular will,"" he added. But like so many presidents before him, Bush's reputation could change with time. Harvard University political history scholar Barbara Kellerman said when President-elect Barack Obama takes over in January, people may view Bush in a new light.  Watch Bush address staff about transition of power » . ""I think it's possible when people have stopped being as angry at the Bush administration as they are now ... that they will realize that some of this is just ... the luck of the draw.""   Kellerman, author of the book ""Bad Leadership: What It Is, How It Happens, Why It Matters,"" noted that Bush has not had luck on his side for the past eight years. ""He [Bush] has been a quite unlucky president. Certain things happened on his watch that most people don't have to deal with -- a 9/11, a [Hurricane] Katrina, the financial crisis, being three obvious examples,"" she said. ""And yet they happened on his watch. He is being blamed,"" she said. And that fact -- coupled with approval ratings around 27 percent, according to CNN's poll released October 21 -- is in large part why Obama and Democrats won big on November 4. Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University, said the country is dealing with a ""lame duck president"" who will most likely face an uphill battle in getting anything passed through Congress before he leaves office. ""We're dealing with an economic meltdown ... We're dealing with two wars. So everything Obama does now is going to be seen as he is the de facto president,"" Brinkley said Thursday. Read Zelizer's take on what Obama should avoid . Historians, beginning to examine Bush's legacy, note that the 43rd president could end up with a better reputation down the road -- something that happened to Harry Truman. At different points in his presidency, Truman earned some of the highest and the lowest public approval ratings in history: 87 percent approval in June 1945  vs. 23 percent approval in January 1952, according to a CNN analysis of polling at the time. Truman, who is often noted for his upset victory over Thomas Dewey in 1948, faced several domestic and foreign policy problems throughout his term in office, which lasted from 1945-1953. Most notably: The Korean War, World War II and later, Cold War relations with an aggressive Soviet Union. ""One of the things that has been conventionally done is to compare George W. Bush to Harry Truman, both of whom had upon leaving office dismal approval ratings and of course as it is well known by now, Harry Truman's reputation has, by virtually every account, not only improved, but I would say escalated nearly to the top of the list of greater American presidents,"" Kellerman added. Another president Bush may be compared to down the road? Ronald Reagan. Prior to leaving office, Reagan faced strong backlash from Republicans and Democrats on opening negotiations with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev during the Cold War era as well as the handling of the Iran-Contra Affair. ""He was seen as bumbling; he was seen as unintelligent; he was seen as a guy driven by his advisers,"" Zelizer added. ""And now he's being talked about like FDR, one of the great presidents in American history and we have a new look at who he was."" Reagan is often invoked by Republicans in presidential races -- most recently with the campaign of Sen. John McCain -- looking to shore up the conservative base. Bush, meanwhile, who has long defended his decision to invade Iraq as a way to spread democracy, could also see criticism dissipate over time if Iraq becomes a thriving, stable country. ""If you imagine that an Iraq in 10,15 years is actually a vibrant, stable democracy and other countries neighboring it move in that direction ... I think you'd have a strong Bush revisionism,"" Zelizer said. ""How things unfold in coming decades can help repair a battered presidency,"" he added. Kellerman said that while many will credit Bush for taking charge of democracy-spreading, his ""incompetence"" will still be noted. ""The level of incompetence after the initial 'mission accomplished' was so acute that my guess is, even if the decision to invade might be historically justified, the incompetence that succeeded it ... I think that's going to be very difficult to ever alter our negative perception of that.""",0.6604689,5449
118,"(CNN) -- Perhaps, now the candidates will play nice. For all their insistence on how unlike they are from one another, the three U.S. presidential candidates share some noteworthy family connections, the New England Historic Genealogical Society has found. Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, who has made his opposition to the Iraq war a linchpin of his campaign, is distantly related not only to President George W. Bush but also to another wartime leader -- former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Because of his shared ancestry with President Bush, Obama is also indirectly related to his rival on the Republican side, Sen. John McCain. McCain, it turns out, is a sixth cousin of First Lady Laura Bush. Meanwhile, Sen. Hillary Clinton, is related to beatnik author Jack Kerouac, Canadian Prime Minster Pierre Trudeau and Camilla Parker-Bowles, wife of Prince Charles of England. Clinton also shares ancestors with Grammy Award-winning singers Celine Dion and Madonna. The senator won a Best Spoken Word Grammy for the audio version of her book, ""It Takes a Village."" Rival Obama also snagged one in the same category for his book ""The Audacity of Hope."" Conservatives who sometimes accuse Democrats of being in bed with liberal Hollywood elites may have been handed one more round of ammunition by the Society's findings. Clinton, the Society said, is related to Angelina Jolie. And Obama is related to Jolie's boyfriend Brad Pitt.  Watch a report on the candidates' family trees and other news » . The New England Historic Genealogical Society, founded in 1845, says it is the oldest such organization in the country. Members spent three years tracing the lineage of the candidates. Among its other findings: . McCain, the Vietnam War veteran who spent five years as a prisoner of war, descends from a long line of kings: Scottish King William the Lion, English King Edward I and French King Louis VII. Obama, the son of a white woman from Kansas and a black man from Kenya, is ""related to millions of contemporary Americans - perhaps even a significant percentage of the population,"" the researchers said. He is cousins with six U.S presidents, including Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman and Gerald Ford. He is also linked to American artist Georgia O'Keefe, the Duchess of Windsor and two men who signed the Declaration of Independence. Most surprisingly, Obama -- the man who could become America's first African-American president -- is linked by ancestry to Robert E. Lee, who commanded the armies of the Southern slave-holding states during the American civil war. Bedfellows, it turns out, make for strange politics. E-mail to a friend .",0.6601436,6021
119,"(CNN) -- Chris Rock is best known for two things: being funny and being crass. ""If you're the president you only have two jobs: peace and money,"" Chris Rock said. ""This is what people come to see. I'm just doing my show,"" the comedian said with a laugh. He's also known for his political commentary, but there's one person he's having a lot of trouble making fun of -- president-elect Barack Obama. This is apparent in his new DVD ""Kill the Messenger,"" which combines three shows from his international tour: New York; London, England; and Johannesburg, South Africa. ""It was a tour nobody wanted to do... because the general perception is that comedy doesn't translate,"" Rock said. But thanks to the Internet, the world is a lot smaller than it was even 10 years ago. And people are digging the same jokes, he said, including ones about John McCain and Sarah Palin. As the DVD readies for release on January 20, CNN talked with Rock about his lack of Obama jokes, Inauguration Day and why racism will never die. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: I watched the special last night, and I noticed that you did a lot of jokes about John McCain -- his age, his war hero story -- but not so many about Barack Obama. Is it harder to make fun of Obama? Chris Rock: He's just one of those guys, you know, like Will Smith. There's no Will Smith jokes. There's no Brad Pitt jokes. You know, what are you going to say? ""Ooh, you used to have sex with Jennifer Anniston. Now you have sex with Angelina Jolie. You're such a loser."" What do you say? ""Ooh, your movies are big. You make $20 million."" There's nothing to say about Brad Pitt. CNN: Why is Obama like that? Rock: It's like ""Ooh, you're young and virile and you've got a beautiful wife and kids. You're the first African-American president."" You know, what do you say? CNN: As time goes on do you think it will get easier? Rock: Of course, as time goes on. At some point he's going to -- there's always slip-ups. No one can survive that level of scrutiny without occasionally making it easy for a comedian. CNN: Let's talk about the inauguration. Are you going? Rock: No, I have to go to Sundance [Film Festival]. I've got a movie premiering at Sundance. So I have to go to the whitest place in America -- Utah. CNN: What's it going to be like for you on Inauguration Day? Rock: It'll be a cool day. It's weird. I've never watched an inauguration. I've never watched anyone get sworn in. You know, it's like Election Day and then you look up and somebody else is the president two months later. It was never like, ""I can't wait till tomorrow. Oh my god! They're going to swear in Jimmy Carter!"" CNN: Are you going to watch this one, though? Rock: I'll put it this way -- like any business is going to be getting done while this guy is getting sworn in. Like I'm going to be in a meeting. Everything is going to stop for however long it takes. Hope they get to it -- hope it's not like I gotta listen to three different versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" or something. I hope it's not like Rosa Parks' funeral, where everybody f***ing speaks. CNN: What are you hoping Barack Obama does for this country? What do you think is his most important task? Rock: You know, if you're the president you only have two jobs: peace and money. That's it. I mean, it's like, what did Clinton do? We were at peace and we had a budget surplus. That's it. That's the gig. The closer you get us to those two goals, you know, that's pretty much the gig. Is that too much to ask for? CNN: At one point in your act, you said, ""Racism will never die. It will only multiply."" Why do you believe that? Rock: Well, it's never going to die. Maybe it won't multiply. Is racism going to end? No. It's not even race. People are always going to, you know, find something wrong with people who are not the exact same as them. That's just what it is. Black, white, short, tall, religions, whatever. People are bad, man. CNN: How was it different playing for an audience in Africa? Rock: You know it's weird -- it really wasn't that different. I mean, that's why I love this special. People are the same wherever you go. And if they weren't, they wouldn't laugh at the same s**t. If they were so different they wouldn't know what I was talking about. CNN: Stand-up comics I've talked to in the past say they like their shows to appear spontaneous. But your new DVD stitches together three shows, illustrating to the audience how scripted comedy can be. Why did you decide on that format? Rock: You know, I don't believe in that ""come up with stuff on the spot."" I mean, honestly, that's why I think comedy, stand-up comedy, always plays such a back seat to music. Like, would you go see a singer if you thought he just came up with the songs? They wouldn't give out Grammys for songs that they just came up with. You're going to go see someone at Radio City or Madison Square Garden, I think you'd like to know that they have an act before you spend $75. So yeah, when you say ""came up with it right there,"" that's really cute when you paid $8 to get in and two-drink minimum. When the ticket's $75, that's a whole other mindset.",0.65694046,3574
121,"(CNN) -- As the first president-elect with a Facebook page and a YouTube channel, Barack Obama is poised to use the Internet to communicate directly with Americans in a way unknown to previous presidents. Since the election, President-elect Barack Obama has posted weekly video addresses on YouTube. Judging by Obama's savvy use of social-networking sites during his campaign and the interactive nature of his transition team's Web site, Americans can expect a president who bypasses the traditional media's filters while reaching out to citizens for input, observers say. ""The rebooting of our democracy has begun,"" said Andrew Rasiej, founder of Personal Democracy Forum and the techPresident blog. ""[Obama] has the potential to transform the relationship between the American public and their democracy."" During the presidential race, Obama's campaign won praise for its innovative use of social-networking sites, including Facebook, MySpace and MyBarackObama.com, to announce events, rally volunteers and raise money. Facebook has more than 150 million active users, and the average user has 100 friends on the site, according to the company. iReport.com: Your chance to ask President-elect Obama a question . Obama has more than 1 million MySpace ""friends"" and more than 3.7 million ""supporters"" on his official Facebook page -- some 700,000 more than when he was elected in November. His campaign also has a database of almost 13 million supporters and their e-mail addresses. Transition officials hope to transform Obama's vast Web operation and electronic list of supporters into a 21st-century tool to help accomplish his goals as president. They even have a name for this ambitious effort: Obama 2.0. ""Obama has invented an alternative media model,"" said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ""In the old model, the president talks to the people on television [and] the people talk back in polls. In the new model, communication is online, and two-way."" Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter didn't exist when George W. Bush took office eight years ago. But since last November's election, Obama has wasted no time embracing these online communication portals. In recent weeks he has taped weekly video addresses and posted them to YouTube, where most have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Obama's staffers also have stopped posting information to social-networking sites since the election, preferring to reach out to constituents through YouTube and Change.gov, the official site of the president-elect's transition team. Visitors to Change.gov can read a frequently updated blog, post their ideas on issues facing the country, and rate others' ideas. Top-rated ideas will be gathered into a briefing book and given to Obama after he takes office. ""They want information going not just from them to the voters, but from the voters back to them,"" Democratic strategist Steve McMahon said Wednesday on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""Thirteen million people pushing a button, sending an e-mail to their elected representatives, making a phone call, taking action, is a powerful, powerful lobbying tool."" ""It's a very smart use of the Internet, to get people to offer ideas,"" said David All, a Republican Internet strategist. All hopes that Obama and his staff take a similar approach to WhiteHouse.gov, the president's official Web site. The current WhiteHouse.gov site, operated by the Bush administration, contains few interactive features. A statement on the president-elect's transition site says that Obama hopes to ""use cutting-edge technologies to create a new level of transparency, accountability, and participation for America's citizens."" It's fitting, then, that Obama's inauguration next week could be one of the most watched video events in Internet history. Rasiej expects that hordes of users will be watching online when Obama takes the oath of office, visiting WhiteHouse.gov and refreshing their browsers to capture the moment the site switches to proclaim Obama, not George W. Bush, as president. As president, Obama will likely not just rely on WhiteHouse.gov but use multiple Internet sites and technological tools to build grass-roots support for his agenda, observers say. ""[Obama] is using the tools that are available to him today,"" All told CNN. ""The next president will be using some of the same tools, and also some tools that haven't been invented yet.""",0.6561421,3481
122,"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama's victory speech Tuesday night  compares favorably with a number of historic orations, a linguist said Thursday. Barack Obama speaks at a rally in Chicago, Illinois, after winning the presidency Tuesday night. ""His goal was to be understood by the widest possible audience during his victory speech, and he seems to have done a great job doing it,"" said Paul J.J. Payack, president of the Austin, Texas-based Global Language Monitor, which analyzed the speech for content, tone and length. ""He's at his best communicating directly and forthrightly with this audience and using different types of rhetorical devices,"" Payack said, noting that the speech was written to a seventh- or eighth-grade level. That's lower than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech (grade 8.8), President Reagan's 1987 ""Tear Down This Wall"" speech (grade 9.8) and even Obama's own 2004 Democratic Convention speech (grade 8.3), Payack said. In the four years since then, ""he has learned to speak more directly and more succinctly when he's giving a major address,"" the word aficionado said. He spoke admiringly of Obama's repeated use of the phrase ""Yes, we can,"" calling it ""very effective."" ""That's a very short, direct sentence,"" Payack said. ""Almost like a drumbeat hammering into people's minds and hearts."" He added, ""something like that comes across as a very effective rhetorical device."" That phrase compares with Reagan's ""Tear Down This Wall"" and President Kennedy's ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"" delivered in his inaugural speech. At about 2,000 words, the speech was short enough not to lose the audience's attention but long enough to cite specifics and cover the subject matter, Payack said.  Watch Obama's victory speech » . Twelve of those words were ""hope"" or variations of the word, which indicates optimism about the change (used nine times) he has promised to effect. Another 23 of the words were ""will,"" another way of making the speech forward-looking. Though most of Obama's verbs were in the active voice, 11 percent of the sentences were in the passive voice, a dependable method of deflecting responsibility, Payack said. He cited Obama's ""There will be setbacks and false starts"" as an example. ""He's spreading the responsibility around,"" Payack said. ""He didn't say, 'I will have setbacks. I will be wrong. I will make mistakes.' He used the passive voice for those types of constructions."" But the vast majority of the hopeful references were in the active voice, he said. ""It's very personal and very active. 'I promise we, as a people, will get there.' "" The speech was notable for what it omitted, too, Payack said. In this case, the absence of a reference to the September 11 terrorist attacks indicates a change in tone, he said. In his closing phrase, Obama repeats the mantra, ""Yes, we can,"" which serves as a call to action, an acknowledgment that the country faces hard work, Payack said. Obama is saying, ""I'm asking you to do something big, but we can do it together,"" Payack said. ""We are the change; we are the hope.""",0.655904,3006
123,"(CNN) -- President Obama is not shy about showing off his jump shot on the basketball court, but on Tuesday night, it was his baseball skills that were put to the test. President Obama throws out the first pitch at the 2009 All-Star Game onTuesday in St Louis, Missouri. Obama, clad in a Chicago White Sox jacket and blue jeans, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in St. Louis, Missouri. His low pitch barely reached home plate and the mitt of St. Louis Cardinals star Albert Pujols. Obama became the fifth president to throw out the first pitch at an All-Star Game, but the first in 33 years. He is following in the footsteps of Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. Asked about plans to practice before the game, Obama said Tuesday, ""I want to loosen up my arm a little bit."" ""The last time I threw a pitch was at the American League championship series, and I just wanted to keep it high,"" the president said of his opening pitch at the 2005 Chicago White Sox-Anaheim Angels game. Aiming high is a good strategy, says St. Louis Cardinals scout Matt Blood, but it takes more than on-point aim to make the perfect pitch. ""Throw it with some force, don't lob it in there. Try to get a good downhill plane. Try to keep it in the strike zone,"" said Blood, who will be at the game Tuesday. HLN sports anchor Larry Smith, who has thrown out a few first pitches, says Obama has to be careful to ""not try to overpower it."" ""There's no speed gun on this. Just make it a nice solid throw to the catcher,"" Smith said. ""The one thing he doesn't want to do is bounce it home. Mr. Obama is pretty athletic, so I think he'll ace this."" Overpowering it shouldn't be an issue for the president, who joked Tuesday that he'd be surprised if his 2005 pitch exceeded 30 miles per hour. The president also needs to make sure he uses his whole arm, Blood said. ""You'll see a lot of people throw kind of out front. Their elbow will start out front and they'll never get their arm back behind their body, and won't get a full arm swing. It will be real short, and not very rhythmic,"" he said. Former Major League Baseball pitcher Jim Bouton said Obama's at the top of his game, and he can ""afford to take a few chances."" ""He should toss it a little further to the left. The righties are down by 15 runs in the ninth, they've got no team leadership. They're fighting with each other in the opposing dugout,"" he joked. All kidding aside, Obama should ""just go with his instincts, like any good athlete,"" Bouton said. ""You don't want to throw the ball into the ground or behind you, that's for sure."" Obama also doesn't want to do what Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory did in his opening pitch for the Reds 2007 season. He missed home plate by 30 feet. Video of the Democratic mayor's embarrassing throw has been viewed nearly 2 million times on YouTube. But the opening pitch isn't always a light-hearted moment. President Bush described his opening pitch at Yankees stadium during the 2001 World Series as ""the most nervous moment"" of his presidency so far. The game came less than two months after the September 11 terrorists attacks. Bush wore an FDNY jacket to pay tribute to the New York City Fire Department. He stepped onto the pitchers mound, and before a cheering crowd of nearly 60,000, he threw a strike. The crowded erupted in chants of ""U-S-A, U-S-A."" Before the game Tuesday night, Obama and all of the living former presidents will appear in a community service video. After the video is shown, Obama will take the field at Busch Stadium and greet the six St. Louis Cardinal Hall of Fame players. He then will throw his pitch to Cardinals' all-star first baseman Albert Pujols. Major League Baseball said the president will wear a specially made glove for his appearance, with a script Obama 44 and an American flag on it. The glove will then be sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. If Obama has butterflies about his pitch, Blood says the president should use the nervous energy to his advantage. ""For Obama, I'm sure he's dealt with much more pressure than throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game, but I would -- instead of seeing it as pressure -- I would think of it as an exciting opportunity and turn the nervousness into positive adrenaline,"" he said.

CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We've got that incredible story coming up in just a minute. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Executive Agenda . AZUZ: First up, a look at President Obama's executive agenda. Today, he's taking off for Asia, making a nine-day trip to the region to meet with world leaders and to take part in an economic conference. Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea. All of them are stopping points along the way. The president plans to talk about the importance of the U.S. and Asian countries working together on things like economic growth, climate change and the war in Afghanistan. That last subject, the war, is something he discussed with his war council yesterday. It was the latest in a series of meetings to review the U.S. approach to the conflict in Afghanistan. President Obama is said to be considering four options, some of which may include sending additional troops to the country. That's something that military leaders have requested and some Republican lawmakers have urged the president to do. In a recent CNN poll, 56 percent of people were against sending more troops, while 42 percent were in favor of it. Earlier in the day, President Obama took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. Just one of the Veterans Day events held around the country. He and first lady Michelle Obama walked through the cemetery's Section 60, where service members from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been laid to rest. During a speech yesterday, the president said ""to all who served in every battle in every war, it's never too late to say thank you."" Is this Legit? RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Brazil is the biggest country in South America. Legit! In fact, Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world, and it's home to nearly 200 million people. Blackout in Brazil . AZUZ: About 60 million of those people were left in the dark Tuesday night by a massive power outage. Officials say it affected 18 of Brazil's 26 states, including some of the country's largest cities. There's some uncertainty about what actually caused the power outage, but it's been linked to a hydroelectric dam. The power was back on in most areas by Wednesday morning. Unsung Hero . AZUZ: Pakistan is a country that's seen a lot of violence this year. Three weeks ago, suicide attacks at a university claimed seven lives. One of them was a janitor who had only started working at the school a week earlier. But his reported actions on that day have many people in Pakistan calling him a hero. Ivan Watson shares his story. (BEGIN VIDEO) IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, ISLAMABAD: 70-year-old Kurshaid Siddique makes this walk every day, clutching a photo of her son. Pervaiz Mahsi was killed on October 20th when a suicide bomber attacked the university cafeteria where he worked. Pervaiz was a janitor. He barely earned enough money to feed his family. Now, some people are calling him a hero. SUMAYA AHSAN, STUDENT: Now, he's like a legend to us because he saved our lives, our friends' lives. WATSON: 20-year-old Sumaya Ahsan and her classmates are also in mourning. The suicide bomber killed three of their friends in the women's cafeteria of Islamabad's International Islamic University. But if it wasn't for the janitor named Pervaiz, they say many more of their classmates could have been killed. AFSHEEN ZAFAR, STUDENT: If he couldn't stop that suicide attacker, there could have been great, great destruction. WATSON: On October 20th, a suicide bomber disguised in women's clothes shot and wounded the guard on duty and then approached this cafeteria, which was packed full of hundreds of female students. The café where this deadly attack took place is back open. This is the doorway where, by some accounts, Pervaiz Mahsi helped stop the suicide bomber from coming in and doing more damage. The explosion instantly killed Pervaiz. Who knows how many young women would have died if the bomber had gotten got into this room? Pervaiz's family lives here, in a house crowded with three other families. The family of eight people lives in this single room, sleeping on three beds. You all are Christians? MAHSI'S SISTER: Yeah . WATSON: They are members of Pakistan's Christian minority, one of the poorest communities in Pakistan. They had to borrow money for Pervaiz's coffiin, and now they're behind on the rent. Pervaiz's mother is inconsolable. From what we've heard, your son really helped save a lot of people and he's a hero. KURSHAID SIDDIQUE, MOTHER OF PERVAIZ MAHSI [TRANSLATED]: ""But my hero is dead now,"" she says. WATSON: The illiterate Christian man who saved the lives of so many Muslim girls is buried here, just a few feet from a muddy road in a garbage-strewn grave. The government of Pakistan is calling him a national hero. Ivan Watson, CNN, Islamabad. (END VIDEO) Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... segregation (noun) the separation of people or groups, especially by race . source: www.dictionary.com . Together at Last . AZUZ: Segregation was a policy that was practiced in many schools across America before a Supreme Court ruling declared it unconstitutional. In Macon, Georgia, many students from the class of 1959 recently attended their 50th reunion. And they decided that while their schools were segregated then, they wanted to come together now. Brooke Baldwin takes us there. (BEGIN VIDEO) BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There are the nametags, the nerves, the hugs of recognition. But a typical 50th high school reunion this is not. Instead, this luncheon marks the first time Macon, Georgia's classes of 1959 have sat side by side ever. BETTY WEBB-HAYES, 1959 GRADUATE, BALLARD-HUDSON HIGH SCHOOL: I grew up in a town for 50 years with all those people around and never knew who they were. BALDWIN: Betty Webb-Hayes knows. In 1959, the southern city's three public high schools -- Ballard-Hudson, Lanier and Miller -- were segregated. In the 1950s, Jim Crow laws ruled, and separate was supposedly equal. But as a Ballard Hudson alumna, as a young child, she says segregation was simply a way of life. WEBB-HAYES: We didn't find out that we were being discriminated against until we were in high school, until that high school teacher told us that we were living in a segregated society. We didn't know it. BALDWIN: Fifty years later, Lanier alumnus Tom Johnson, former CNN president and publisher of the ""L.A. Times,"" had an idea to close the five-decade gap. In a letter to Macon's three classes of 1959, Johnson wrote, ""It was a different world then. We were divided by policies, politics, and tradition. It is a different world today. We no longer are separated except by personal choice."" That letter and several months of planning later, 210 members of the class of 1959 sat together at last. RUBY DEAN DUPREE, 1959 GRADUATE, BALLARD-HUDSON HIGH SCHOOL: Well, the old saying is better late than never. I could not sleep last night. So, it just means the world to me. It was just like waiting for Santa Claus to come. LINDA CARSTOFFEN GUGEN, 1959 GRADUATE, A.L. MILLER HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIRLS: I realized how much we actually missed, people that we could have known. BALDWIN: For this former class president, the gathering of old and new friends brings tears to her eyes, not just because of the symbolism, but for the empty seats, classmates whose attitudes on race 50 years later haven't changed. GUGEN: There are some people that still feel resistant to the idea and think that what we're pushing for is not a good thing. And I think we have to focus on the ones that were here today. I think those people went away with a changed heart. BALDWIN: It may have taken those people 50 years to come together. Unlike these old-fashioned photos, their story is no longer told in black and white. Brooke Baldwin, CNN, Macon, Georgia. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: CNN Student News has made an online upgrade!

125,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was working from home Thursday after fracturing her right elbow during a fall the day before, State Department officials said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was treated and released after fracturing her elbow. Clinton fell Wednesday afternoon at the State Department on her way to the White House and was taken to George Washington University Hospital. She was treated and released. She will have surgery to repair her elbow in coming weeks. Clinton was with Richard Holbrooke, President Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, when she fell. ""Secretary Clinton appreciates the professionalism and kindness she received from the medical team who treated her this evening and looks forward to resuming her full schedule soon,"" said department spokeswoman Cheryl Mills. Philip Crowley, an assistant secretary of state, said Obama was one of the first people to call Clinton Wednesday night. Clinton was at home ""resting comfortably, or uncomfortably. She is working from home. She is already taking some calls, and I'm sure starting to learn the limits of movement -- how well you can text with one arm in a sling,"" Crowley said. CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.",0.65176475,4817
126,"(CNN) -- ""Saturday Night Live"" was formed in the crucible of the mid-1970s, when Watergate brought respect for politicians to all-time lows, the counterculture was taking over comedy, and many television viewers were seeking out something fresh and bold. Fred Armisen played Barack Obama in a talked-about sketch Saturday night on ""Saturday Night Live."" It was a powerful combination -- and after 34 years, the combination of ""SNL"" and politics can still strike sparks among political observers. The most recent example came this past weekend when Fred Armisen, as President Obama, chided ""those on the right"" for saying that he was ""turning this great country into something that resembles the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany."" Not true, said Armisen as Obama. ""When you look at my record,"" he said, ""it's very clear what I've done so far -- and that is nothing.""   Watch the sketch -- and the reaction » . The sketch has caused a rumble among the inside-the-Beltway chattering classes and New York news nabobs. Wrote Washington Post blogger Jonathan Capehart, ""When your 'friends' start talking about you like this -- and friends with a huge megaphone and a feel for the national mood -- the White House should listen."" ""Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous. Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president,"" added CNN political contributor Ed Rollins in a column. The White House had no comment when asked about the sketch by CNN. ""SNL"" cast members weren't available for interviews, an NBC representative said. ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels also turned down an interview request but has said the show doesn't take sides. ""I think 'SNL's' role is, the moment they're in power, we're the opposition,"" he told CNN's Alina Cho last year. ""We're not partisan. We're not, you know, we're not putting on anything that we don't believe is funny.""  Video gallery: ""SNL"" takes on presidents through the years » . The recent sketch is indicative of the end of Obama's honeymoon, Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson says, but he doesn't want to read more into it than that. ""Comedy is about going after the people in power,"" he said. The president has also taken recent shots from ""The Daily Show"" and ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" ""What this says is that the comedy-industrial complex has turned its sights on the reigning president of the United States,"" he said. But, he added, ""I wouldn't put this into the meme category,"" referring to concepts that travel so quickly they take on a life of their own, such as Tina Fey's Sarah Palin sketches from last year. ""The [Obama] sketch wasn't that funny."" Indeed, the show's overall impact is often mixed, observes Slate columnist and Rutgers media studies professor David Greenberg. It can ""capture or intensify"" a storyline that's being passed through the news media, but the show is more a barometer that can change with events. ""It's not incapable of influencing things,"" he said, noting the show's slash-and-burn '70s satire and Fey's Palin parody. ""But since the early '80s, those moments are pretty rare. ... You'll see good impersonations but not the underlying critique you had with, say, Dan Aykroyd as [Richard] Nixon."" Besides, he added, the Obama sketch may have titillated the politico-media crowd, but he wonders whether its impact went any wider. ""I'm a political junkie,"" he said, ""and this is the first I've heard of it."" Indeed, the ratings for the episode were a far cry from last year's Palin-fest -- from a 7.3 rating for the same week in 2008, to 4.7 -- and the Armisen sketch didn't get the frenzied online dispersion the Palin sketches did. iReport.com: 'SNL' won't hurt Obama . However, Obama should be concerned about one thing, observes Thompson. In general, ""SNL"" mocked previous presidents' personal characteristics, such as Clinton's outsized appetites or George W. Bush's struggles with spoken English. With Obama -- who lacks the same kind of easily caricatured traits, Thompson says -- the show went after his record. ""In some ways,"" Thompson said, ""he's vulnerable to more serious damage.""",0.65146255,6704
128,"Washington (CNN) -- In the tight circle that surrounds President Obama, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs is in the inner bubble. He's the 3 a.m. wake-up call when North Korea fires a test missile, or when the Nobel committee picks the president for the top award. ""Trust me, it is a job I would gladly give to anybody who would volunteer,"" Gibbs said. Or would he? After all, he's an adviser, a friend and a mouthpiece for the administration with more access than recent press secretaries. ""I can walk in and ask him a question at any given time, pick up the phone and talk to him about anything at any given time. I think [that] makes my job easier,"" Gibbs said in an exclusive interview with CNN. The president and the press secretary first connected in 2004 when Obama was a virtual unknown outside of Chicago, Illinois, and was campaigning for the U.S. Senate. They clicked and grew close, leading Obama to tell the Wall Street Journal in a 2008 interview, ""Robert is the guy I want in the foxhole with me during incoming fire. If I'm wrong, he challenges me. He's not intimidated by me."" Gibbs chuckled while recalling the comment and quipped, ""That is when we called him 'Senator' or by his first name."" While challenging Obama when he was on a campaign bus is much different than pushing back in the Oval Office, Gibbs insists that Obama still seeks opposing opinions and dislikes an atmosphere where everyone tells him he's right. Ten months into his job in the White House, Gibbs, who grew up in Auburn, Alabama, says he's finally starting to get more comfortable, even though he admits that the 24/7 pace ""is certainly a challenge. It can wear you down."" Especially when it comes to the daily main event. Gibbs briefs the White House press corps, usually for about 45 minutes. He rarely shows up on time, but he's always ready to spar. The mouthpiece for the president often uses humor or sarcasm to deflect a tough question. In one exchange about the tit for tat over cable chatter and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, Gibbs uttered, ""I'll plead guilty to counterproductivity."" In another about managing the message, Gibbs said, ""Is there any evidence currently going on that I'm controlling the press? Poorly, I might add!"" Is this an effective strategy to handle the media? ""You tell me,"" Gibbs said. ""Look, there's no doubt that using a little humor to get out of a series of bad questions isn't an altogether bad technique."" Watch Gibbs talk about his job . Especially since he's involved in a daily high-wire act, as he calls it. The cameras are always rolling. A bad day for the White House spokesman usually means a bad day for the administration. ""My father likes reminding me he always thought my mouth would get me into sizable trouble, which it can on any given day,"" Gibbs said. Before starting his job, Gibbs studied former press secretaries and sought out their advice. He still relies on their guidance ""fairly frequently,"" he said. For example, Gibbs revealed that just last week he reached out to former Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry to get ""feedback on a question that was sort of nagging me a little bit."" When probed on what that question was, Gibbs replied, ""I'm not going to get into that, but good try."" Even with the major policy issues the White House is juggling, from Afghanistan to health care to the economy, Gibbs says he's still having fun. ""If you didn't enjoy the job that I have, it would be the worst job in all of Washington,"" he said. What he doesn't like, he said, is the fact that he's now a celebrity. ""People that I don't know recognize you walking down the street. It's awkward,"" he said.",0.6494545,8445
129,"(CNN) -- A street vendor in Ghana's capital sells small American flags with an image of President Obama on them, in front of a billboard that proclaims ""Akwaaba"" -- or ""Welcome"" -- next to a smiling image of the U.S. leader. President Obama says he chose Ghana partly because of the ""democratic commitments"" by President Mills. When Obama arrives in Accra on Friday night, he will be the third sitting American president to visit the West African nation of Ghana. But unlike Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Obama is only visiting Ghana and no other country in the continent. Obama said he picked Ghana as the first African country he would visit as U.S. president partly because of the ""democratic commitments"" demonstrated by President John Atta Mills, who took office in January after a close election. ""By traveling to Ghana, we hope to highlight the effective governance that they have in place,"" Obama said Tuesday in an interview with AllAfrica.com. During his 24-hour visit to Ghana, Obama will meet with the president and address parliament before he and first lady Michelle Obama tour the Cape Coast Castle, which was used in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Security has been tight all week in Accra, and Ghana plans to deploy some 10,000 security forces during Obama's visit, according to Ghana News Agency (GNA). The White House has set up SMS codes to allow people across Africa to send ""words of welcome"" via text message to Obama during his visit. Obama has already received thousands of messages, and plans to answer several of the questions sent to him, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported on Thursday. Bill Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit Ghana, in 1998, as part of a six-nation Africa tour. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, stopped there during a four-nation Africa tour during his last year of office that largely focused on U.S. aid programs. Ghana's government named a road after Bush to recognize his government's contribution towards the country's development. As the United States' first African-American president, Obama's trip has broader significance as well. Obama's father is from Kenya and he expressed concern about the political situation in that East African nation. ""The political parties [in Kenya] do not seem to be moving into a permanent reconciliation that would allow the country to move forward,"" Obama told AllAfrica.com. ""And Kenya is not alone in some of the problems that we've seen of late, post-election or pre-election."" Many in Kenya were critical of Obama's decision to pick Ghana the first African nation he visited instead of his father's birthplace. During his campaign for president, Obama was hailed by many as a ""son of Kenya."" Shortly after the White House announced the Ghana trip in May, newspaper headlines in Nairobi asked, ""Why Obama Snubbed Kenya."" A political cartoon in one Kenyan paper showed Air Force One dropping a note to Kenya's leaders saying, ""Get your act together,"" as it flew over the country. Obama said he wanted his visit to Africa to mean more than just something to cross off his list as U.S. president. ""I actually thought that it made sense for us to connect a trip to Ghana to a previous trip with the G8 ... to show that Africa is directly connected to our entire foreign policy approach,"" Obama told AllAfrica.com. ""That it's not some isolated thing where once every term you go visit Africa for a while to check that box, but rather it's an ongoing part of a broader discussion about how we move many of these international challenges forward."" As Ghana gears up for the visit, a group of local singers and rap artists wrote a welcome song for Obama and produced a music video on YouTube. ""President Obama, Welcome to Ghana,"" they sing, with images of U.S. and Ghanaian flags interspersed between the musicians. ""We welcome you to the Land of Gold.""",0.64933026,7022
130,"Harold Holzer, co-chairman of the U. S. Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, is the author of the new book, ""Lincoln President-Elect: Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter 1860-1861"" and author, co-author or editor of 32 other books. Harold Holzer says Obama represents validation of Lincoln's hope of equal opportunity for all. NEW YORK (CNN) -- They are big shoes to fill by any standard, political or historical. Pointing to his oversize, specially made boots, Abraham Lincoln once confided that he may have been slow to put his foot down, but once he did, he never went back. That's a lesson worth learning for any president-elect. And few incoming chief executives have been as conscious of the 16th president as the 44th: Barack Obama. The new president-elect wrote about Lincoln in his acclaimed books. He not only chose to announce his candidacy for the presidency on Lincoln's birthday, in 2006, but did so outside the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, where Lincoln delivered his famous ""House Divided"" speech in 1858 and where he had his headquarters as president-elect. The myriad comparisons between the two skinny, big-eared Illinoisans -- Obama's own fond description -- are already entering the realm of modern legend. Both were believed too inexperienced to be president. See iReporters don stovepipe hats to pay tribute to Lincoln . Both were long-shot underdogs for their party's nomination. Yet each went on not only to win, but to nominate the defeated party favorite (who happened to be a senator from New York) as secretary of state. William H. Seward was Lincoln's choice, Hillary Clinton is Obama's. But of course there are substantial differences: Lincoln got his education ""by littles,"" he once embarrassingly admitted, spending less than a year all told in primitive one-room schoolhouses. Obama was superbly educated at Columbia University and Harvard Law. One man was a Republican, the other is a Democrat. And while Barack Obama scored an impressive victory, the nation divided bitterly over Lincoln's 39 percent plurality in a four-person race, to the degree that the Electoral College validation remained in question -- much more like Bush vs. Gore -- as late as February 1861, while seven Southern states seceded rather than accept a Lincoln presidency. Yet fascinating similarities predominate. Both men wrote best-selling books (yes, Lincoln, too: he brought out a hugely popular edition of his Lincoln-Douglas debates). Both won fame through their transcendent oratory. Both got into political trouble over their church affiliations -- Lincoln for leaving his church too soon, Obama for not leaving soon enough. Both refused to take pets along to the White House, but promised to shower their small children with pets once they arrived (the Lincolns left their mangy dog Fido behind and President-elect Obama has vowed to get a dog for his girls once settled in Washington). He might have to do better. Willie and Tad Lincoln eventually obtained kittens, turkeys and ponies. And here is another fascinating side story. Both men felt the need to make one final visit -- before their life-altering presidencies -- for reunions with the women, neither one a natural mother, who helped raise them. Obama, of course, went back to Honolulu to see his gravely ill grandmother right before Election Day; Lincoln, right before Inauguration Day, visited rural Charleston, Illinois, to say goodbye to his aged stepmother -- who wound up outliving him. But most extraordinary of all, surely, is the fact that Barack Obama's victory serves to help complete the ""unfinished work"" Abraham Lincoln spoke about in his Gettysburg Address: that America fulfill its dream of equal opportunity regardless of race. Lincoln, of course, advanced black freedom and black voting rights; Obama represents the validation of those elusive aspirations. It is not difficult to understand why so many Americans see Barack Obama as the second coming -- of Abraham Lincoln, if not more. Lincoln once declared, ""We cannot escape history,"" and after years of national indifference to, or defiance of, the lessons of the past, our next president seems to love, comprehend, and use the past to illuminate the future. iReport.com: Can you speak like Lincoln? Comparisons can invite problems, too. On his triumphant election night, Obama properly noted that Lincoln faced a crisis far graver than our own, then quoted Lincoln's hope that ""while passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection."" Those words came right out of Lincoln's first inaugural address. But in fact they were written not by Lincoln himself -- rare for America's greatest writer-president -- but by his incoming Secretary of State Seward. Lincoln later performed an editing miracle to transform the draft into near-poetry. Using this lesson, Obama should be asking Hillary Clinton for a draft. But that probably won't happen. Sometimes reality trumps even history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harold Holzer.",0.6492648,3428
131,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- From Capitol Hill to Springfield, Illinois, President Obama and Congress paid tribute Thursday to Abraham Lincoln on the bicentennial of his birth. Visitors greet an Abraham Lincoln impersonator in Washington on Thursday. ""It is an honor to be here: a place where Lincoln served, was inaugurated, and where the nation he saved bid him a last farewell,"" Obama said at the Capitol on Thursday. ""As we mark the bicentennial of our 16th president's birth, I cannot claim to know as much about his life and works as many who are also speaking today, but I can say that I feel a special gratitude to this singular figure who in so many ways made my own story possible -- and who in so many ways made America's story possible."" White House officials say Obama's speechwriter had several conversations with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin in crafting the speech. ""At a moment when we are far less divided than in Lincoln's day but when we are once again debating the critical issues of our time -- and debating them sometimes fiercely -- let us remember that we are doing so as servants of the same flag, as representatives of the same people and as stakeholders in a common future. That is the most fitting tribute we can pay and the most lasting monument we can build to that most remarkable of men, Abraham Lincoln,"" Obama said.  Watch more on the Lincoln celebration taking place » . Obama will also speak later Thursday at an event in Springfield. Throughout the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama -- a Democrat who hails from the Land of Lincoln -- reminded audiences from coast to coast about the similarities between himself and the beloved political leader. At his presidential acceptance speech in Chicago, Illinois, on November 4, Obama used Lincoln as a guide for his ideology. ""As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, 'We are not enemies but friends. ... Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection,' "" Obama said.  Watch a young student read one of Lincoln's speeches » . In Washington, a congressional tribute took place at the Capitol rotunda. Illinois senior Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, gave the keynote address. At the end, a wreath was placed at the Capitol. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield also opened its doors Thursday for a special celebration, featuring original documents including the Gettysburg Address.  Watch CNN's Kyra Phillips take a tour » . Meanwhile, the Library of Congress marks the bicentennial Thursday by opening a special exhibit featuring Lincoln's handwritten speeches and artifacts, including the Bible used last month by Obama during his swearing-in. ""This exhibit, in a little more than 200 items, presents Lincoln, the man and the politician,"" said John Sellers, curator of the exhibit, which runs through May 9. Lincoln successfully fought a proposal for legalized slavery as development spread to the Western United States, and he eventually brought an end to slavery throughout the country. Among the manuscripts on display is a letter he wrote in impassioned defense of his Emancipation Proclamation.  Watch actor Sam Waterson's reading of Lincoln speeches » . The librarian of Congress, James Billington, acknowledges that the materials are available on the Internet in ""digitized"" form, but he said ""there is something about seeing the original because, after all, Lincoln was a man of words, of rare eloquences."" ""His words changed history,"" Billington said. The exhibit at the Library of Congress -- on Capitol Hill next to the U.S. Supreme Court -- was in the works for Lincoln's bicentennial long before the presidential campaign in which voters elected Obama. Billington said the exhibition is all the more profound as visitors explore the links between the anti-slavery Lincoln and the African-American Obama. There are also grim reminders of Lincoln's assassination. An original ""wanted"" poster with large black letters reads: ""$100,000 Reward. The murderer is still at large.""

132,"Washington (CNN) -- Two people without invitations crashed President Obama's first White House state dinner, the U.S. Secret Service said Wednesday. The Secret Service confirmed a Washington Post report that the couple who crashed Tuesday night's dinner were Tareq and Michaele Salahi. The Post described the couple as polo-playing socialites from northern Virginia. A Secret Service checkpoint ""did not follow proper procedures"" to determine if the two were on the guest list for the dinner, said Edwin M. Donovan, a Secret Service special agent, in a statement. Playing down any security threat, Donovan's statement said: ""It is important to note that these individuals went through magnetometers and other levels of security, as did all guests attending the dinner."" The incident represents a security breach for the White House at the Obama administration's biggest social event to date. More than 300 guests, including Cabinet members, diplomats and Hollywood celebrities, attended the dinner in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ""The Secret Service has tasked our Office of Professional Responsibility with conducting a comprehensive review of the incident,"" Donovan's statement said. Video footage of the dinner showed the couple walking past journalists into the event. On Wednesday, Michaele Salahi's Facebook page included photos of the couple at the dinner, including two pictures with Vice President Joe Biden and another with Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, who was identified on the page as ""Ron"" Emanuel. The couple's names did not appear on the guest list distributed Tuesday by the White House. In an e-mail to CNN, Mahogany Jones, who identified herself as a publicist for the Salahis, said the couple had ""full clearance to attend the state dinner."" Fran Townsend, a homeland security adviser to former President George W. Bush, said the incident likely involved a breakdown at the ""perimeter"" security for the event, which is the first checkpoint that guests encounter. Lying to the Secret Service could bring a felony charge, Townsend said.",0.64621663,7930
133,"Editor's note: Steve Clemons directs the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation and publishes The Washington Note, a popular political blog. Steve Clemons says the Nobel panel correctly decided Obama's approach to diplomacy holds great promise. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Cynics will say that Oslo was jealous that Copenhagen, Denmark, scored a visit from President Obama, and giving him a Nobel was the only way to get him to Norway. But the Nobel Committee's decision to make Obama the only sitting U.S. president since Woodrow Wilson to receive the Nobel Peace Prize shows the committee's clear-headed assessment that Obama's ""unclenched fist"" approach to dealing with the world's most thuggish leaders has had a constructive, systemic impact on the world's expectations of itself. Obama has helped citizens all around the world -- including in the United States -- to want a world beyond the mess we have today in the Middle East and South Asia. They want a world where America is benign and positive, and where other leaders help in supporting the struggles of their people for better lives rather than securing themselves through crude power. Obama has found a way in this interconnected world of cell phones, Twitter, Facebook and other social networking to reach a majority of the world's citizens with his message of hope for a better world. He speaks past the dictators to regular people and has, on the whole, raised global political expectations about everything from climate change to nuclear nonproliferation in ways that no one in history has done before. Americans tend to look at everything from a U.S.-centric lens, and many woke up this morning shocked that Obama, who just saw a lot of his political capital wasted on trying to secure the 2016 Olympics for his hometown of Chicago, has gotten a fresh injection of sizzle to fill the Obama bubble. The world has been mesmerized by Obama since he started to run for the presidency. The battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama for the Democratic nomination did more to educate the rest of the world about real political choice -- and about a system in which no candidates had an automatic lock on victory -- than any USAID program could have achieved. Obama's decision to make the ulcerous Israeli-Palestinian negotiations one of the first foreign policy challenges of his administration, rather than the last, defied most seasoned analysts' expectations. His message to Iran's citizens, marking the Persian new year holiday of Nowruz, and his powerful and captivating speech in Cairo, Egypt, communicated to Muslims all around the world that their lives and their faith and their expectations for a better world were vital and as valid as any others. From his perch in the White House, Barack Obama affirmed the humanity of Muslims and told them that America does value Muslim lives. Obama's posture and rhetoric have reversed the collapse of hope and trust that the world's citizens had in America and stopped the degradation of America's image during the tenure of George W. Bush and Richard Cheney. Should a U.S. president get the Nobel Peace Prize if he's about to send more U.S. troops, armed drones, bombs, tanks and other military hardware into the war-ripped zones in Afghanistan? Or should Obama get the prize if he hasn't even succeeded in getting Israeli-Palestinian negotiations going? Or if he hasn't gotten Iran to drop its nuclear ambitions and to re-enter the international system on constructive terms? The answer is yes. I think that given how the odds were already so stacked against Obama on the global economic and security fronts, one can only be amazed at what this unlikely and fascinating president has done with ""optics."" The night before Obama's inauguration, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel accepted my congratulations and responded, ""It's going to be tough, and right now we can only change the optics,"" meaning that political perceptions and appearances could be changed more quickly than hard realities. What is brilliant about Obama and why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is that he is a global leader who clearly saw the gains that could be made in changing ""the optics"" of the global order, upgrading the level of respect between the United States and other nations, making a point of listening to other leaders. Obama saw that before the world could move to a more stable and better global equilibrium, it had to believe it could -- and this is what Obama has done in ways that no other leader has in memory. Obama will still make mistakes. Leaders will still wrestle with him. Hard choices and the gravity of war will still generate challenges for Obama's leadership. But the Nobel Prize Committee has shrewdly given a key down payment for a kind of leadership it wants to see from the U.S. for many more years and given Obama another tool to help craft a new global social contract between the United States and other responsible stakeholders in the international system.

President Bush and first lady Laura Bush sit down with CNN's Larry King Live on Tuesday. ""The most important job I have had -- and the most important job the next president is going to have -- is to protect the American people from another attack,"" Bush said. Accompanied by first lady Laura Bush and engaging in a wide-ranging conversation with King, Bush also said that his administration has been involved in stopping specific threats against the United States since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""We've learned a lot of information about al Qaeda that we didn't know before,"" Bush said of intelligence activities during his tenure as president. ""We've stopped some specific threats -- we're decimating [al Qaeda's] leadership."" He did not offer specifics, but he did offer a self-assessment of his leadership in national security post-9/11.

""Opinion polls aren't going to be high when the economy is in the tank,"" he added. ""People aren't happy with the economy. Neither am I. But you can't make decisions based on popularity polls.""

Asked about inaccurate intelligence reports on alleged weapons of mass destruction that led up to the war in Iraq, Bush refused to criticize the CIA, saying only that he was ""disappointed."" On Iraq, he maintained that actions taken by his administration were correct. ""I don't think Iraq was wrong,"" Bush said in response to a question from King. ""What I was worried about, (was) Iraq going to fail -- not Iraq was wrong,"" he said. ""And the surge has worked and a young democracy in the heart of the Middle East has taken hold. There's more work to be done. But al Qaeda has been denied the base in which they wanted to operate.: .

You'd like him, too."" But Laura Bush said she took some of Obama's critiques of her husband personally. ""Were you angry at it?"" King asked. ""Yes, sort of. George didn't really even know about it because he didn't really watch it that much,"" Laura Bush said, laughing.  Watch Laura Bush express her disapproval » . ""So what's new?"" Bush piped in. ""When you make big decisions and tough calls, you're going to get criticized.""

""I've done my best, though, to make sure I didn't bring the presidency down to that level."" On other topics: . • Bush said he favors closing the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but only ""under the right circumstances. ""The problem is, you've got a bunch of cold-blooded killers down there that if they ever get out they're going to come and kill Americans, and I'd hate to be the person that made that decision."" • Asked by King, ""Are we ever going to find (Osama) bin Laden, Bush replied, ""Yes, of course, absolutely. We've got a lot of people out there looking for him, a lot of assets. You can't run forever. • As to whether the United States had ever come close to capturing bin Laden, Bush said, ""I don't know -- I can't answer that. I really don't know.

Alfred Bouey is a World War II veteran and a grandson of slaves. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Alfred Bouey, an 84-year-old African-American, still remembers the stories from his grandfather about the scars on his body from the beatings he took as a slave in the South. Bouey, of Oak Park, Illinois, attended Tuesday's inauguration of President Obama. Words can't express his excitement and happiness about witnessing history. A World War II veteran, he never thought he would live to see a black president in America. Bouey grew up in Arkansas and saw racism firsthand. He witnessed his mother being mistreated by whites in the South, but he never saw her give up. He eventually left Arkansas for Chicago. Bouey attended the inauguration after winning Brookdale Senior Living's Experiences of a Lifetime contest. Residents at various Brookdale Senior Living communities nationwide shared their experiences and submitted their wishes as part of the contest. Bouey shared his story and said he'd like to be there when Obama was sworn in. ""My grandfather and grandmother were whipped and beaten, and had the scars to prove it,"" he said. With CNN.com's help, Taresh Moore spoke with Bouey about the inauguration ceremony. Below is a transcript of their interview. Moore: How are you today? Bouey: I'm great. I couldn't feel any better right now. Moore: How did it feel to take part in this historic inauguration? Bouey: It felt very great. I can't find any words to express my happiness. I am speechless and full of joy. Moore: What will you remember most about the inauguration? Bouey: I will remember that I was actually there. I lived to see this historic event. I'm 84, and I had the chance to witness this. Not too many people had that opportunity, and I am honored. Moore: How did you feel when you found out that you and your family were going to Washington, D.C., to take part in the inauguration? Bouey: I was happy. At first when I was asked to take part in the survey, I didn't mind sharing my story because I had many stories to share. When I found out I had the opportunity to go, I was very grateful. I couldn't wait to get here. Moore: Did you ever believe you would live to see an African-American president in your lifetime? Bouey: No. I never thought I would live to see one. Growing up, my mother wanted me and my brother and sister to get an education. And we all did. An education will take you far, and we see that it did for our new president and for me. But I'm glad I lived to see this. It's a wonderful experience, and I am very proud of it! Moore: How was it growing up in the South? Bouey: I was born in Philadelphia and moved to Arkansas at the age of 1. Growing up, everything was segregated -- in the schools, restaurants and just everywhere. Blacks couldn't do this and we couldn't do that. I came to the point where I got tired of it all in the South and just moved away. I moved to Chicago on June 2, 1946. Moore: Was it better in Chicago? Bouey: Yes, a lot better. Better opportunities for blacks. Moore: You have lived a life that has seen the scars on the body of a former slave, who was your grandfather, to seeing America's first African-American president all in one lifetime. How does that make you feel? Bouey: I feel that America has come a long way. And I mean a very long way. My grandfather had scars from slavery. My mother wasn't a slave, but she still was beaten in the cotton fields. Beatings didn't stop for some years after slavery. But there are no slaves now. It shows the great progress this country has made. Moore: How do you think your grandparents and mother would feel to see the first African-American president? Bouey: I believe it would mean more to them than it means to me because of how they were treated and the hard work they put in. This would be like their reward for all of the work and suffering they endured. Others, like Martin Luther King, who I marched with, would be very happy as well. Moore: How did you feel when President Obama was first elected? Bouey: Well, I had tears of joy on Election Night. I cried. They almost had to mop up the floor due to all of the tears that came out of my eyes. It was just a great feeling. Moore: How do you feel about President Obama and the future of America? Bouey: I feel that America is headed in the right direction. The youth are our future, and the youth in the African-American community has a great example of a role model to look up to. Any youth from any race can look to President Obama. They don't have to sell drugs or other bad things. Be like Obama, get an education and succeed in life. Moore: Millions of people of all races filled Washington this weekend to witness history. Of those people, many white Americans filled the city to see a black man being sworn in as president. How does that make you feel? Bouey: I feel happy. It shows change. It's good to see the white Americans appreciate and show love to the new president. And it's good to see everyone come together for a special occasion. We're all equal, no matter what color your skin is. Moore: If you could say anything to President Obama, what would it be? Bouey: I would say job well done. Our prayers are with you. Keep your faith in God, and he'll keep you.",0.64325666,4458
136,"Editor's note: Rudy Ruiz founded RedBrownandBlue.com, a site featuring multicultural political commentary. He is host of a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show and wrote a guide to success for immigrants (""¡Adelante!"" published by Random House). He is co-founder and president of Interlex, an advocacy marketing agency based in San Antonio, Texas. Rudy Ruiz says the lives of U.S. presidents can make them positive role models for students. SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- Perhaps we got too used to living in a nation where the president inevitably becomes persona non grata. Maybe after the Clinton and Bush years, we forgot how to give a president a chance to serve not just as a punching bag but also as a role model. Have we become so disenchanted and polarized we can't give our own president a chance to teach our children something about what it takes to succeed? As a small-town boy, I drew inspiration from presidential biographies. As I got lost in the adventures of Teddy Roosevelt, the spirit of George Washington and the ideals of Thomas Jefferson, I found kernels of America's greatness. In those pages, I unearthed a yearning to dream beyond my surroundings, to strive for more, to seek a way to contribute to our nation. Many of the leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, born in a log cabin in Kentucky, ascended from humble beginnings on the wings of education to guide America forward. Devouring their stories, it ceased to matter where I was from or how far removed I was from the centers of power. With an education and a dream -- in America -- anything was possible. Whenever President Obama addresses our youth, he embodies the power of education. Education is the cornerstone of our democracy, the key to upward mobility, a linchpin to transforming whimsical dreams into actionable goals. Ask Bill Clinton. Raised by his widowed mother in Arkansas, he became a Rhodes Scholar. Look at Barack Obama. Emerging from a broken family, he built on degrees from Columbia and Harvard in his odyssey to the White House. Remember Dwight Eisenhower. Hailing from Kansas, he attended West Point on his way to heroism. From both sides of the aisle, education has propelled the career trajectories of our nation's leaders. Even if we disagree with a president's policies, we should accept he can serve as a role model in a broader way. For example, Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. Nobody would argue this was admirable. But Jefferson was also a great thinker, diplomat and strategist. He co-authored the Declaration of Independence and helped America become a global power by engaging Europe and transacting the Louisiana Purchase. Was he perfect? Of course not. Would we want our children to emulate his every action. No way. But has he been an inspirational role model over time? As a parent, I understand people's concerns about the concepts to which their children are exposed. But the content of the president's speech to students should assuage any worries regarding his motives. Clearly, his agenda is to inspire kids to make the most of education in building a better life, not to brainwash a generation to do his bidding. Pointing to his own experiences, as well as those of others from diverse and modest origins, his remarks convey the importance of personal responsibility, perseverance and education in fulfilling one's potential while contributing to our nation's future. The only way to argue with that is by confusing the issues, twisting the situation into something it was never intended to be. It's gotten so bad, some folks don't want their kids exposed to the president because they're afraid he'll teach them socialism. My answer is that even if he did plan to discuss socialism, they should let their child listen. Of course, the president wouldn't do that, but why is that my answer? Because, as another role model -- President Reagan -- once said: ""All great change in America begins at the dinner table."" In that light, the president's speech isn't a threat but an opportunity for families to engage their children on the issues. If parents disagree with the president's views, they can sit down at the dinner table with their kids and explain their divergence. They may even find, when it comes to the value of education, President Obama might say something worth hearing. In the process, parents will teach their children: . • That we should listen respectfully to others. Doing so, we might realize that we can appreciate certain aspects of a person while disagreeing with others, and that partial differences of opinion needn't always spur absolute rejection. • That we should respect the president because, even if we didn't vote for him, we're still one nation. • That we should give our president an opportunity to lead by example. Obama's presidency is still young. We don't know what shape his legacy will take. But given his resume, regardless of politics, he's an excellent role model on the value of education. Why not give him a chance to serve in that capacity? iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's speech . Just as I found inspiration in those biographies during my childhood, our youth might be moved by the president's words and stories to cherish knowledge and learning, harnessing the power of education to grow into productive, exemplary Americans in their own right.

137,"(InStyle.com) -- Is anyone else besides Michelle Obama leaving the house these days? Because for the last week, you would have thought that Anne Hathaway, Gwyneth Paltrow and Halle Berry had gone into the Witness Protection Program. First lady Michelle Obama arrives with President Obama in London, England, for the G-20 Summit. During first lady Michelle Obama's whirlwind visit to Europe this past week, her refreshing take on American style has emerged. It is elegant, smart, appropriate and shows the first lady to be comfortable in her own skin. Coverage surrounding the first lady's wardrobe in Europe, from cardigans to kitten heels, has been relentless, riveting, fawning and, frankly, missing the objective of her strategically packed suitcase. No doubt about it, Michelle Obama scored big, looking terrific everywhere, delighting everyone -- probably no one more so than Mickey Drexler, CEO of J. Crew. But the post-game commentary sparked by each of her appearances has been hyperbolic when it hasn't been comical.  See photos of the first lady's outfits » . You would have thought each of the first lady's ""face offs,"" as both American and British tabloids labeled her meetings with Queen Elizabeth II, Britain's first lady Sarah Brown, and France's Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, had been deliberately set up as counter-programming to C-SPAN's coverage of the budget negotiations in Congress.  Watch Michelle Obama wow the world » . One wire service reporter asked me if Michelle, wearing a two-toned silk dress by Isabel Toledo, should have ""taken a bigger fashion risk"" when meeting the 83-year-old British monarch, who was all mumsy in blush pink. It was an afternoon tea, folks, not the Embassy Ball in ""My Fair Lady."" Another wanted to know if I agreed that the first lady's now-sold-out J. Crew outfit, an embellished cream cardigan and mint-green jacquard skirt, was ""a little too down-market"" to meet the prime minister of England's wife, completely overlooking where the two women were headed after the photo op. Or would a bias-cut silk charmeuse dress have been a wiser choice for visiting a children's cancer ward? But the main event was going head-to-head with the former supermodel, pop-star first lady of France, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. Except both women wound up wearing similar bow-tied coats -- Mrs. Obama's floral print number by the American designer Thakoon, and her counterpart's, a dove-gray look by the French house of Dior. Nevertheless, Tina Brown's TheDailyBeast.com went so far as to immediately declare the up-until-recently overtly scrutinized Mrs. Bruni-Sarkozy ""over."" The citizens of France might argue the point. More importantly, the press has been missing the over-arching point of our new first lady's wardrobe. Despite the declaration by many of the fashion community's talking heads that she is this generation's Jacqueline Kennedy, Michelle Obama's approach is quite different. True, Michelle's reception has been equally rapturous. But, Mrs. Kennedy's transatlantic mission nearly 50 years ago was to show the world that despite America's image of a country fueled by energy and youth, it was also one of elegance, poise and culture. In addition, whether speaking in English or French, Mrs. Kennedy purposely presented herself and her husband as children of privilege, embracing the aura of Camelot, which had cast them as American royalty. Conversely, what's most striking about each of Mrs. Obama's appearances is not the grandiose message, diverse labels or designers' origins. Rather, it is their unmistakable, uniform accessibility and appropriateness. Michelle Obama looks exactly like what she is: a modern American, working woman. Her outfits appear comfortable instead of buttoned up, her impression is pretty rather than formal, her silhouette based on sportswear -- the form of design that is at the heart of American fashion -- not politics. Add warmth, confidence, and openness and what the world is seeing -- besides someone who knows how to pack for a week -- is a woman they would want to know, to embrace as a neighbor or a friend. Though I'm still having trouble getting past those kitten heels (note to Michelle: You'd look so much better in a four-inch pump. Don't worry, your husband can handle it), what Michelle Obama has brilliantly accomplished in fairly record time is refashioning the image of Americans as relevant, approachable, relatable, and best of all, likable.

For his bio, read here. For a Democratic freshman's view, read here. Jason Chaffetz says he's saving money by sleeping on a cot in his office, but there are downsides. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- I do something a bit different than most members of Congress. I sleep in my office on a cot. A few months ago, I was speaking with a current member of Congress and he said he slept in his office. Awesome! We are paid well, but the cost of caring for two households and supporting a family of five is high. I thought this would be a great way to save $1,500 per month. Besides, I work late into the night and usually arise about 5:30 a.m. No need to waste time commuting and spending money on a place where I don't intend to be spending much time. I came here to work, not sleep.  Watch video of Jason Chaffetz' life in Congress » . So I bought a cot at Smiths grocery store and carried it on a plane to Washington. I sleep in the closet by the door to the outside hall. The cot itself is fairly comfy. Best thing is there is no bar in the middle, so my back is doing quite well. The only downside is what is happening outside. The cleaning crew obviously works throughout the night. They do a great job, but they have a Zamboni-like machine (the kind you see on ice rinks) that cleans the hallways. It has a horn and they use it! It makes an obnoxious beeping sound that you hear on trucks that are backing up, and it definitely keeps me up at night. At 12:52 a.m. during the first week, the ""Capitol Early Warning System"" was tested. It works! Even though I sleep in my office, I do shower. The House has a gym. I pay $240 to use the facilities. Typically I head down first thing in the morning to wash up and work out in the evening. I thought it would be like a nice golf club or certainly as ""lavish"" as a Gold's Gym. Not so much. It's nice, but it's more like a high school gym with the small narrow lockers from the 1950s. I locker next to Jose Serrano (D-New York). On the political spectrum we are probably as far apart as possible. Yet, just in our gym clothes we get along great. He's a nice guy and he offered a wealth of perspective and suggestions to a freshman. Aside from the routine details of settling in, the first weeks of my term have been filled with surreal moments. Never did I think I would be seated just yards away from one of the most historic presidential inaugurations in the history of our country. To watch firsthand as President Bush peacefully transitioned the presidency to Barack Obama was a surreal and inspiring moment. My most vivid memory of the moment was watching the two men embrace after the oath of office (the first one). It's part of what makes this country so strong and so marvelous. In many ways, my own election reflected the miracle of this country. With no paid staff, no polling, no campaign office, no free meals for potential voters and no debt, I took on a 12-year Republican incumbent and won by a 20 percent margin (I ate one of our own) despite being outspent by $600,000 through the primary election. On January 6, 2009, I, too, raised my right hand and was administered the oath of office. With my 15-year old son, Max, by my side, tears flowed down my face. The emotion of the moment was overwhelming. The history of the House of Representatives, my desire to be the very best representative I can possibly be, the massive amount of people counting on us to do what is right, and the opportunity to do good all hit me at once. Over the past several weeks, the 22 Republican freshmen have been building our friendships. Our bond is tight, we are all working hard and we are having fun, too. This week, House Republicans met with President Obama and debated the stimulus bill. I voted against it. Our national debt has increased an average of $2.8 billion per day since January 2007. We must cut spending, not increase spending, for the long-term health of our economy. One day I went up to see my colleague Chris Lee's (R-New York) office.

141,"Editor's note: John Feehery worked for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients that include News Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America. John Feehery says he's proud Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, but now the president needs to earn it. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Usually, when a president wins the Nobel Peace Prize, it is uniformly seen as a positive development for America and for the world. Both opponents and allies tend to celebrate the fact that an American president actually got recognized by a bunch of Norwegians for something he achieved. But with Barack Obama, who surprisingly picked up his first Nobel Prize on Friday, the reaction was not altogether positive from either the left or the right. You would expect that conservatives would raise questions about the president's award. Conservatives raise questions about everything the president does. But liberals also joined in. Mickey Kaus of Slate said that the president should say thanks, but no thanks. ""Turn it down! Politely decline. Say he's honored but he hasn't had the time yet to accomplish what he wants to accomplish."" Liberal columnist Richard Cohen wrote a mocking column, comparing Obama's award to a fictional award given to Sarah Palin for promising to ""read a book someday."" We are all glad that Norway loves Obama, but come on. Let's get serious. I am reminded of when Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf decided to retire the jersey of longtime White Sox player Harold Baines. It was a little premature for Baines to get his uniform retired when he himself was playing for another team. (Baines played a couple more years, surely the only instance where a player's uniform was retired before the player was.) Awarding Obama the Nobel Peace Prize is similarly premature. In fact, the White House seemed as surprised as anybody about the gesture. I imagine that when Obama first picked up the line, he thought it was a crank call. ""I won what?"" he must have exclaimed. But it is no joke. It seems that President Obama won his first Nobel Peace Prize, for, well, being President Obama. Just the very idea of a President Obama is enough to make the Nobel Selection Committee swoon. The president said he was humbled by this award. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, he has much to be humble about. When it comes to peace, it is hard to see what notable accomplishments have been achieved thus far in the Obama presidency. That is not a slap at him. Peace takes time. It took John Hume and David Trimble about 30 years of really hard and dangerous work in Northern Ireland before they got a Nobel Peace Prize. And despite all of that hard work, peace and reconciliation is still elusive in that region. Mr. Obama hasn't even been able to get a peace deal between Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who continue to snipe at each other over the health care public option and Afghanistan. Peace hasn't exactly broken out in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, or Iran either. Nobel Prizes usually go for some fairly notable accomplishments. Nelson Mandela spent much of his life protesting apartheid and serving a prison sentence. He is a man who deserved a peace prize. Mikhail Gorbachev allowed the Soviet Union to collapse without much of a whimper. That was an accomplishment that deserved a peace prize. But what exactly has President Obama done to deserve such an award? And if he actually does something in the future, does that mean he gets another one? Apparently, the voting on the peace prize started shortly after the president was sworn in. Perhaps he is getting the peace prize because of his inaugural address. Yep, a lot of people came to that speech, and peace mostly reigned on that day (except for those people with tickets to the Inauguration who got stuck in the ""purple tunnel"" in Washington). But I don't think he deserves a peace prize for that. I guess he got the prize because he was elected president and he wasn't George Bush. Well, if that is the case, maybe all of those millions of Americans who voted for him should share the prize, because they actually did most of the work. They voted. As an American, I am proud that our president was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. Now, I, like many others on the right and the left, would like to see him do something to earn it.

142,"(InStyle.com) -- Michelle Obama dazzled on the dance floor Tuesday night at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball in Washington, wearing an elegant, one-shouldered ivory gown created for her by 26-year-old designer, Jason Wu. First lady Michelle Obama dazzled in a Jason Wu original gown. The one-of-a-kind silk chiffon confection was embellished with organza rosettes, Swarovski crystal rhinestones and silver embroidery. The first lady accessorized with diamond chandelier earrings, a white gold and diamond ring and a stack of diamond bangles by jeweler Loree Rodkin. The president summed up his wife's look best before their first dance -- to Beyoncé's rendition of ""At Last"" -- when he said, ""First of all, how good-looking is my wife?"" Michelle Obama has worn Wu once before, during an interview with Barbara Walters. Wu, one of America's leading young designers, debuted his first collection in February 2006 and has since earned accolades such as Fashion Group International's Rising Star Award.  Watch InStyle.com's Joe Berean discuss the gown » . Obama was likely introduced to the designer in one of her favorite Chicago, Illinois, boutiques, Ikram. The new first lady has made a conscious effort to support young, diverse talent in the fashion community. In choosing Wu, who is originally from Taiwan, Obama continues a tradition of wearing American designers who hail from other countries. They include Cuban-American designers Isabel Toledo, who designed her yellow lace inauguration ensemble; Narciso Rodriguez, designer of the red and black dress she wore on election night; and designer Thakoon Panichgul, originally from Thailand, who designed the floral dress she wore the evening her husband accepted the Democratic nomination for president. Michelle Obama's style statement is one meant to inspire ethnic and class diversity in the world of fashion. Aside from being a socially conscious purveyor of style, Obama also sends a clear message of hope and promise by choosing colorful, reasonably priced pieces.  Watch the Obamas enjoy the night » . She prefers bright, cheerful shades such as yellow, electric blue, red and purple, and has been seen on multiple occasions in head-to-toe looks from moderately priced American retailer J.Crew. In fact, daughters Malia and Sasha braved Tuesday's chilly weather in coats from the brand's children's collection. Michelle Obama was first seen in J.Crew during a visit to the ""Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno on October 27. ""This is a J.Crew ensemble,"" she told the host. ""We ladies, we know J.Crew."" The first lady also said she had a penchant for Internet shopping, saying, ""When you don't have time, you gotta click!"" Obama wore J.Crew again at the Kids' Inaugural Concert on Monday. She gave the colorful ensemble a luxe spin with dangling green sapphire earrings from Loree Rodkin and a Deco-inspired belt buckle. InStyle magazine Fashion Director Hal Rubenstein appreciates Obama's straightforward approach to fashion. ""People tend to think classic looks are synonymous with boring, but they're not,"" he explains. ""Michelle Obama has a specific style that works for her. She has a lady-like approach to style that is elegant and inspiring. ""What we'll see as a result is this idea of looking put-together and sophisticated, as opposed to being daring or flamboyant. It's all about looking polished, like you know what you're doing."" Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2009 Time Inc. All rights reserved.",0.63758236,2639
144,"(Mental Floss) -- We're in the throes of summer vacation season, but at least one American is still on the job. While it's rumored that President Obama will follow in the footsteps of President Clinton and vacation on Martha's Vineyard, he hasn't had a chance to break out his Bermuda shorts just yet. When Obama does take off, though, he'll join in the grand tradition of presidential vacations, like these notable ones: . President Bush (R) and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen ride bikes in Crawford, Texas, in 2008. 1. Abe Lincoln doesn't go too far . Far-flung vacations are nice, but President Lincoln preferred to stay a bit closer to home. When Lincoln needed a getaway from the heat and political turmoil of Civil War-era Washington, D.C., he headed to...a different part of Washington, D.C. From 1862 to 1864 Lincoln spent June through November living in a cottage atop a hill at the Soldiers' Home a few miles from the White House. Lincoln apparently loved the slight change of scenery, which meant slightly cooler temperatures and a chance to ride his horse each morning. If you're considering a stay-cation this year, consider this Honest Abe's endorsement. 2. Movie cowboy does real ranching . Think George W. Bush was the first president to sneak away from the White House to spend time on his ranch? Not quite. At the end of his second term as Governor of California in 1974, Ronald Reagan paid just over half a million dollars to acquire Rancho del Cielo in California's Santa Ynez Mountains. The 688-acre ranch, complete with stables and a 1500-square-foot adobe house, was Reagan's go-to vacation destination while he was in office, and he entertained some big names there, including Margaret Thatcher, Queen Elizabeth II, and Mikhail Gorbachev, who gamely wore a cowboy hat during his visit. 3. LBJ does some ranching, too . Texan Lyndon Johnson was very involved in the everyday operations of his ranch. Johnson, who had gotten into ranching in 1951, grew his LBJ Ranch into a 2,700-acre spread populated by 400 head of Hereford cattle. Johnson was no absentee owner when he was in Washington, either. Johnson frequently headed back on vacations and supposedly drove his foreman crazy by calling every day to talk about the weather on the ranch or how the pastures looked. Today, the National Park Service maintains LBJ's spread as a working ranch, complete with a herd of cattle descended from the Herefords Johnson bred. 4. George W. Bush initiates a war on brush . George W. Bush followed in LBJ's footsteps and went to his own Texas ranch when he needed a getaway. Prairie Chapel Ranch, a 1,583-acre spread Bush owns near Crawford, Texas, served as the secondary White House throughout Bush's presidency, and he was often shown clearing brush during vacations. Bush wasn't just doing farm work, though. He exhorted visitors to join the ""President's 100-Degrees Club"" by running three miles or biking 10 after the mercury hit 100 degrees. Anyone who could pull of the feat got a specialized Under Armour shirt as recognition. We can only hope one of the many foreign dignitaries Bush entertained at the ranch -- including Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair, Silvio Berlusconi, Ariel Sharon, and Saudi King Abdullah -- managed to get one of the coveted shirts into their suitcases. Mental Floss: Iraq, Afghanistan and other extreme vacation spots . 5. FDR heats up Georgia . Some presidents choose to head to their hometowns or a beach side resort for their vacations, but Franklin Roosevelt preferred to travel to western Georgia. Warm Springs, Georgia, is the home of (you guessed it!) warm springs that supposedly had therapeutic value for polio sufferers. FDR, who had contracted his own paralytic illness in 1921, started visiting Warm Springs in 1924 in the hope that exercising in the springs' warm waters would cure him. Although the springs didn't reverse his illness, FDR felt like his time at the resort alleviated his symptoms somewhat. In 1927 he bought the resort he'd been staying at, and in 1932 he ordered a six-room Georgia pine house to be built on the property. This house was FDR's retreat throughout his presidency and became known as the Little White House. FDR was sitting for a portrait at the Little White House when he died of a stroke in April 1945. Today, the house is part of Georgia's state park system and is open to visitors; it's been preserved to look almost exactly as it did the day FDR died. 6. Nixon gets the right ice cubes . When Richard Nixon wanted a break from Washington, he headed to a modest ranch home he owned on Key Biscayne off Miami. Nixon's ""Florida White House,"" which he visited 50-plus times during his tenure in office, eventually swelled to include three houses and a floating helipad, which the Department of Defense installed at a taxpayer expense of $400,000. (There was plenty of room for taxpayer outrage at the $625,000 total the government spent sprucing up the Florida White House; one itemized expense was $621 for a replacement icemaker because ""the President does not like ice with holes in it."") Given that this house was Nixon's retreat, it's no surprise that some shady dealings transpired on the premises. Nixon allegedly discussed plans for the Watergate break-in at the house, and he holed up there when the coverup came to light. The house fell into disrepair after Nixon sold it, and in 2004 it was razed to make room for a new building. The Florida White House wasn't Nixon's only retreat, though. He bought a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean in San Clemente, California, shortly after taking office in 1969. Nixon dubbed his new digs ""La Casa Pacifica,"" but the press quickly started referring to the spread as ""the Western White House."" This house wasn't cheap for taxpayers, either; the government dropped over a million dollars improving this home with temporary office quarters for staffers, helipads, and an upgraded heating system. Mental Floss: Donald Nixon and other memorable presidential siblings . 7. Teddy Roosevelt goes bear hunting . Lounging on the beach is great, but do you really think Teddy Roosevelt would miss the opportunity to do something manly? Roosevelt's vacation in 1905 took him to the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, where he stayed for three weeks while bear hunting. 8. FDR's successor gets his own little White House . Harry Truman may have been from Missouri, but he headed south when he needed some R&R. Truman started suffering from exhaustion in late 1946, and his physicians recommended a warm weather vacation to revitalize the President. Truman took his vacation in a converted duplex in Key West that already held some history. The house, which was originally built in 1890 for the commandant and paymaster of Key West's naval base, had already hosted William Howard Taft while he was in office in 1912. When Thomas Edison developed 41 new weapons to aid in the American efforts in World War I, he spent six months living in the house. Once Truman visited the house, though, it quickly became known as Truman's Little White House. He ended up spending 175 days in Key West over the course of his two terms in office. Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy later used the house while they were in office, and it's now open as a tourist attraction. Mental Floss: Early summer jobs of Truman, LBJ and more . 9. Kennedy retreats to his compound . Starting in 1926, Joseph P. Kennedy began taking his family to Hyannisport, Massachusetts, on vacation each summer. His son John liked the area so much that in 1956 he bought a cottage of his own near his parents' digs, and the family soon purchased a third cottage in the area, giving rise to the name ""the Kennedy Compound."" JFK used his cottage as a base of operations for his presidential campaign and later vacationed there each summer he was in office. 10. George H.W. Bush prefers not to ranch . Not to be outdone by the Kennedys, the Bush family has an even older compound of their own in Kennebunkport, Maine. In 1903 George H. Walker, the grandfather of George H.W. Bush, built a great mansion on his oceanfront estate in Kennebunkport, and the property has remained in the family ever since. George H.W. Bush used the Kennebunkport compound as his vacation home during his presidency, and George W. Bush made a few getaways to the house as well. Between father and son, they've entertained some pretty big names at their summer house, including Yitzhak Rabin, Vladimir Putin, and Nicolas Sarkozy.

145,"(CNN) -- CNN's Larry King talked with former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday night at the William Jefferson Clinton Center in Little Rock, Arkansas. Bill Clinton talked politics and more with CNN's Larry King on Tuesday night. In a wide-ranging interview, King talked with Clinton about the stimulus bill, the auto bailout, President Barack Obama's BlackBerry, Chelsea Clinton's future, Sarah Palin and more. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: The stimulus bill passed today [Tuesday]. The president signed it in Denver. Is it going to work? Bill Clinton:  I think it will do what it's designed to do. And I think it's important that the American people understand what it's designed to do. It's supposed to do three things. Number one, put money in people's pockets who are in trouble now -- extended unemployment benefits, the modest tax cuts, increase in food stamps. That will help grocery stores and other businesses and keep Americans who are good, honest, hardworking people afloat.  Watch Larry King's interview with Bill Clinton » . The second thing it's supposed to do is give a chunk of money to state and local governments, primarily for education and health. That is designed to make sure that they don't have to either have big tax increases or lay a million people off. Either one, in this economy, would be bad. The third thing it will do is to create jobs through existing road and bridge contracts, through rail improvements, through modernization and especially through clean energy and energy efficiency. So I think that given how fast it had to be done and the compromises that had to be made, it's quite a good bill. And I think it will do what it's designed to do. King: John McCain and others on the other side of the ledger are saying that he didn't come forward enough to the Republicans, he didn't make them part of this Easter basket. Clinton: Well, I disagree with that. I think the only way he could have gotten a lot of them to vote for him would be to accept their economic theory. Their economic theory is why we're in this mess in the first place. King: Do you resent it when the Bush people say that this problem started with you, it started in your administration? Clinton: Well, they don't have much evidence for that. I always answer, does anyone seriously believe if the team I had in place had been in place for the last eight years that this would have happened? And the answer to that is no. We had a much more vigorous regulatory environment with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We were watching these derivatives. I do think we should have done more on derivatives. King: Before we move on to other things, should taxpayers be bailing out the automakers? Clinton: We don't owe it to them. We should only do it if it's in our interests. I believe it's in our interests ... King: We keep hearing about Obama's BlackBerry -- he's got a special BlackBerry now that doesn't have to be recorded into the White House. Do you have the number? Clinton: No. No. King: Would you like the number? Clinton: I know that in the world that exists today, if you're hyper-busy, you need them. Hillary lives on hers. King: Do you have one? Clinton:  I don't. I like being able to concentrate on what I'm doing one thing at a time, you know. And I think if I had one, I'm so hyper and always trying to do three things at once, I'd be worse than he is or worse than she is. So I don't have one. King: What's Chelsea going to be? Is she interested in government? Clinton: Yes, she's interested in government. She cares about public health. She thinks that America has still got a ways to go to develop an affordable, high quality health care system. And I think she wants to be a part of it. King: Sarah Palin, net plus, net gain? Clinton: I think she was a net plus before the failure of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of the stock market, because she gave (McCain) credibility on the Republican right. Through no fault of her own, she became a negative on September 15th, because nobody on their team had any economic experience, and the burden against the Republicans was overwhelming. King: What do you make of President Obama? I mean, for a while I know that you were down and dirty tough when Hillary was running. And that was a pretty rough campaign, a very close campaign. What do you make of him now? Clinton: Well, I always had a great respect for his abilities. Those have been confirmed by the way he's conducted himself in the transition and in these early weeks. I think he is very smart. And I think he wants right things for America. And I think he's made good people decisions and good policy decisions. King: Can he try to live like a normal person -- going home to Chicago, kids go to school, he helps take them to school, plays basketball, goes out to public restaurants? Can you keep that up? Clinton: I think so.  I did quite a bit of it and I wish I had done even more. King: What would you recommend or say or advise George W. Bush about being a former president? There aren't many of you. Clinton: Well, first I would advise him to make his own decisions with Laura about how they want to spend both the next five years and then the rest of his life. You have to assume he'll live 20 to 25 more years, and he seems to be in very good health. And I think he should just look at this as a whole new phase of his life. King: You opened the second Clinton Global Initiative University conference this past weekend and also a thousand students attended. How do you see the younger generation responding the global challenges, especially in these economic times? Clinton: There is a very large number of them who are doing astonishing things. For example, one young woman decided that she's going to go around and collect all the kitchen grease from all the dining halls and then nearby eateries and then use it to make biodiesels, to run cars and lawn mowers and generators. King: For all the years we've known each other, it never gets dull. Clinton: Thank you.",0.63646907,3333
146,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pentagon officials have begun preparing for the first transfer of power during war since Vietnam. They insist that the complicated transfer from the Bush administration to the Obama administration will go smoothly. The coming transfer of power during wartime will be the first since 1968. President Bush met Thursday with members of his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and urged them to cooperate. ""We're in a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us, and they would like nothing more than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people,"" Bush said. ""For the next 75 days, all of us must ensure that the next president and his team can hit the ground running."" Teams in Gates' office and that of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, have been working on the transition for months, according to Pentagon officials.  See who Obama may be considering for his Cabinet » . With ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it will mark the first time a transfer of power has taken place during wartime since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson handed over power to Richard Nixon while the Vietnam War raged. ""We are preparing to make this as smooth a transition as we can,"" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said this week. Although officials say the transition is in good hands, little is being said about what discussions will occur between the Pentagon teams and President-elect Barack Obama's transition teams when they begin showing up within days or weeks. ""There is a recognition that given that we are a nation at war, that energy and effort [should] be sufficiently placed to ensure that we don't drop any balls, because national security and supporting our fielded forces that are engaged in combat is of paramount importance to this country,"" Whitman said. Robert Rangel, special assistant to Gates and the deputy secretary of defense, is in charge of the transition process in the Pentagon, while Marine Brig. Gen. Frank McKenzie, who reports to Rangel, is leading the effort for the Joint Chiefs. Last month, Gates issued guidelines for the transition, stressing that the department must maintain continuity of operations and ensure efficient and effective transition between the outgoing political leaders and the incoming administration, according to Whitman. The Pentagon has opened offices for Obama's transition staff. The nondescript offices are just down the hall from the secretary of defense's office and have been readied with computers, phones and filing cabinets. The offices remain empty until staff members are designated by Obama's team and cleared through the White House. ""The initial contact point for the Obama transition team will be through the White House, and there will be a discussion on the way forward on the transition, and what will happen out of that will be a memorandum of understanding that says, 'these people will be working with the Defense Department,' so we know who has been sanctioned and designated by the president-elect,"" Whitman said. In his comments Thursday, Bush said, ""ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for the rest of my presidency.""",0.6357974,1504
147,"(CNN) -- Two words, delivered with index finger punctuating the air and directed at the president of the United States, made a little-known South Carolina congressman one of the most controversial men on the Internet -- at least Wednesday heading into Thursday. Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama. As soon as Rep. Joe Wilson was identified as the person whose angry and audible outburst disrupted President Obama's health care speech to Congress, condemnation was swift -- and brutal. Within minutes, someone had altered Wilson's entry on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia: . ""He is a [expletive] that called the president of the United States a liar on national television and has no respect for the office he holds."" When the Web site scrubbed the sentence, an even more offensive entry wormed its way in. iReport.com: ""You are disrespectful, sir"" Soon, the site disabled edit options for Wilson's entry, chalking it up to ""vandalism."" On Twitter, post after post urged users to condemn Wilson's breach of protocol, listing his Web site address and his congressional office phone number. Web surfers who visited http://www.joewilson.house.gov/ were greeted with the message: ""This site is down for maintenance. Please check back again soon."" Those who called his office number either could not get through because the line was busy, or could not leave a message because the phone continued to ring without activating voice mail. ""If he's the face of the GOP, we'll have public option by Columbus Day!"" wrote Andisheh Nouraee, a columnist for Creative Loafing, an alternative weekly in Atlanta, Georgia. Democrats on Capitol Hill piled on the condemnation as well. ""Biggest disappointment of evening, the total lack of respect show by one member for the president,"" wrote Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri. ""Never acceptable to behave like a jerk."" As ""Joe Wilson"" trended on Twitter as the most popular conversation topic -- and on Google among the most searched terms -- the lawmaker's supporters fought back. Many set up Twitter accounts and posted their first tweets Wednesday night and early Thursday. ""You have nothing to apologize for. You should be applauded for standing up and speaking the truth,"" said Jamie Sawyer of Madison, Wisconsin. ""Good for him! Too bad he had to apologize"" was a comment on the Lonely Conservative blog. ""At last the little man found his voice tonight and called Obama what he surely is, a liar,"" said another blog, Sunlit Uplands. By early Thursday, genuine tweets about Wilson were interspersed with ads for male erectile dysfunction: ""Joe Wilson Cialis $1.9 Viagra $1.1 (Web site address)"" Though Wilson issued an apology, saying his emotions got the best of him, few online bought it.  Watch Obama react to the ""You lie!"" outburst » . On the Internet, where speculation runs rife, tweeters pointed to a comment Wilson posted on Labor Day as evidence that his outburst was planned: . ""Happy Labor Day! Wonderful parade at Chapin, many people called out to oppose Obamacare which I assured them would be relayed tomorrow to DC,"" the tweet from Wilson's account said. On Facebook, where users aren't impeded by Twitter's 140-character limitation, a prolonged and nasty war of words dominated Wilson's page. ""I have no problem being called a liberal hack by illogical, fear filled, unintelligent people. and actually, I will take it as a complement,"" wrote Janine Feczko. Name-calling was met by ad hominem attacks: ""Janine, I'm sure in the trailer park where you live they gush over your incredible intellect and witty commentary. After all that toothless grin and tripple chin screams Harvard Law,"" wrote Dan Colgan. Nine hundred and 10 comments later, the battle raged on early Thursday. Amid all this, the campaign of Democrat Rob Miller, who hopes to unseat the Republican Wilson in next year's midterm elections, raked in the dough: more than $200,000 from 5,000 individuals overnight and Thursday morning after Obama's speech, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Finally, there were those who found humor in Wilson's heckle. A hastily created Web site, JoeWilsonIsYourPreExistingCondition, hurled a new insult at the politician with every click of the refresh button. ""Joe Wilson poured salt on your lawn,"" said one. Refresh. ""Joe Wilson traded the dead batteries in walkman for the fresh ones in your TV remote."" Refresh. ""Joe Wilson yells 'Freebird' at concerts."" Not everyone, however, was busy assigning blame to Wilson. Los Angeles actor and comic Paul Scheer decided to shoulder it. ""I apologize 4 yelling 'liar' during Obama's speech,"" he jokingly wrote. ""Sen McCain ate my Kit Kat while I was in the bathroom & he pretended like he didn't.""",0.63360685,6144

Rice said she wasn't bothered by criticism about her or the administration's polices, saying if a person in her business is not being criticized, ""you're not doing something right."" ""I'm here to make tough choices, and this president is here to make tough choices, and we have. And yes, I -- there are some things that I would do very differently if I had it to do over again. You don't have that luxury. You have to make the choices and take the positions that you do at the time,"" she said. Asked about historians who say Bush is one of the worst presidents, Rice said those ""aren't very good historians."" ""If you're making historical judgments before an administration is already out -- even out of office, and if you're trying to make historical judgments when the nature of the Middle East is still to be determined, and when one cannot yet judge the effects of decisions that this President has taken on what the Middle East will become -- I mean, for goodness' sakes, good historians are still writing books about George Washington. Good historians are certainly still writing books about Harry Truman,"" she said. Rice, 54, said she has enjoyed working in the Bush administration during the last eight years, first as national security adviser, then as secretary of state. ""There is no greater honor than to serve this country,"" she said, adding that there is also no greater challenge. Rice said when the new administration takes over, she plans to return to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and write two books -- one on foreign policy and one about her parents.",0.633405,4613
151,"(Mental Floss) -- Have you ever been watching television and thought, ""Wow, this soap opera is so good it could cause the downfall of a corrupt communist regime,"" or even, ""I bet one day this show is going to send the first woman into space""? Well, maybe you're not giving the boob tube enough credit. Popular television shows have influenced politics in the United States and around the world. While others are busy blaming television for all of society's downfalls, we think it's time someone stood up for ye olde idiot box. After all, these 10 television shows didn't just entertain, they helped convince the world to get with the program. 1. ""DALLAS"" The Show that Overthrew a Dictator . (Well, kind of.) ""Dallas"" was one of the most popular TV shows in history -- and nowhere was it more talked about than in Nicolae Ceausescu's communist Romania. How did the soap opera get past Romanian censors? With help from ""Dallas"" leading man, J.R. Ewing, of course. Because J.R. was portrayed as a despicable oil baron, Ceausescu's government presumably decided the show must be anti-capitalist. Whatever the reasoning, ""Dallas"" became a runaway hit when it arrived in Romania in 1979. A series about wealthy, beautiful people (evil or not) was an inspiration to Romania's poor and dejected masses. Eventually, the government decided such Western television was a bad influence, and ""Dallas"" was taken off the air in 1981. But by then, it was too late. The fantasies of Western life lived on in the imaginations of Romanians, and in 1989, Ceausescu was overthrown during a public uprising. Not incidentally, the actor who played J.R., Larry Hagman, visited Romania some years later and was treated as a hero. In an interview following the experience, Hagman said, ""People from Bucharest came up to me in the street with tears in their eyes saying, 'J.R. saved our country.' "" 2. ""SEE IT NOW"" The Show that Ended McCarthyism . If you know your 1950s history (or if you saw the movie ""Good Night, and Good Luck""), you know the impact crusading journalist Edward R. Murrow had on American politics. His vehicle for galvanizing change? The current affairs show, ""See It Now,"" which premiered in 1951. Well known as a World War II radio correspondent, Murrow wasn't a fan of television initially. He wanted to go beyond the talking-head discussions and newsreels that filled most nightly news shows at the time. So when he finally decided to move forward with ""See It Now,"" he did so on his own terms. The show's debut episode featured television's first live coast-to-coast transmission, which included a split-screen of the Brooklyn Bridge on one side and the Golden Gate on the other. Murrow also broke new ground by airing a day in the lives of Korean War soldiers. Of course, the show's most influential role was in exposing Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist fear campaign and opening Americans' eyes to the many lives and careers it was ruining. Thanks in part to fallout from Murrow's broadcast on March 9, 1954, the U.S. Senate reprimanded McCarthy for abusing his power, and McCarthyism came to an abrupt end. Murrow wasn't afraid to take on rogue senators, and later, he proved he wasn't scared to take on Big Tobacco, either. Two episodes of ""See It Now"" explored the link between cigarettes and cancer -- a brave move, considering television depended heavily on tobacco sponsorships at the time. But perhaps Murrow had a personal interest in the story. A three-pack-a-day smoker who regularly appeared on camera with a cigarette in hand, Murrow died of lung cancer in 1965. 3. ""GENERAL ELECTRIC THEATER"" The Show that Turned Ronald Reagan into a Republican . In the early 1950s, film actor Ronald Reagan was at a low point in his career. So when Taft Schreiber, of the Music Corporation of America, got him a gig as the host of the anthology series ""General Electric Theater,"" Reagan jumped at the opportunity. For $125,000 a year and part-ownership of the program, he not only hosted the show, but also toured America as a ""goodwill ambassador"" for the electricity giant, giving speeches to plant employees and acting as its public spokesperson. By the time ""General Electric Theater"" was cancelled in 1962, Reagan was a new man. Turns out, all those years defending free enterprise for one of the nation's biggest multinational companies had transformed Reagan into one of America's leading conservative speakers. Although the actor had long been a Democrat, the Republican Schreiber convinced Reagan to change political parties. Four years later, the newly Republican Reagan was elected governor of California, and the rest is presidential history. 4. ""CATHY COME HOME"" The Drama that Transformed the Welfare State . Directed by Ken Loach (who later became one of Britain's most respected filmmakers), the drama ""Cathy Come Home"" was a poignant episode of the BBC-1 anthology series The Wednesday Play. It told the tragic story of Cathy Ward, a young wife and mother who becomes the victim of Britain's welfare state. Going from working-class struggle to dire poverty, Cathy's journey begins when her husband loses his job following an accident and becomes unable to support the family. In a painful spiral toward destitution, Cathy suffers through various states of homelessness, separates from her husband, and eventually, has her children forcibly taken away from her by government council workers. A truly horrifying story, its impact was compounded by the fact that ""Cathy Come Home"" was filmed in such a realistic style that some viewers thought it was a documentary. And although the Conservative Party government claimed the movie was ""full of blunders,"" Labour Party politician Anthony Greenwood said the show should be ""compulsory viewing once a month for the next five years."" British audiences agreed, and ""Cathy Come Home"" was aired again shortly after. The ensuing public outrage helped bring major changes to British welfare law. Other nations followed suit, with similar reforms and charities. 5. ""THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR"" The Show that Swung an Election . ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" was many things. It was the first network TV show to make fun of the Establishment, support America's counterculture, and have enough nerve to put blacklisted singers (such as Joan Baez and Pete Seeger) back on the air. Ironically, however, the show's major achievement might have been making Richard Nixon president. As a gag, show star Pat Paulsen ran for office during the 1968 presidential election. ""I'm consistently vague on the issues,"" announced Paulsen on national television, ""and I'm continuing to make promises that I'll be unable to fulfill."" Regardless of his humorous motives, Paulsen seemed to have a ""Ralph Nader Effect,"" stealing 200,000 votes from the Democrats and helping to swing one of the closest elections in history. Thanks to Paulsen's efforts, Nixon narrowly defeated Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey. ""Hubert Humphrey told me I cost him the election,"" recalled Paulsen, ""and he wasn't smiling when he said it."" E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

152,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House said it had no comment Monday in response to the upcoming release of a new Michelle Obama action-figure doll. The Michelle Obama doll is available in three outfits, all of which show off her trademark bare arms. The 6-inch doll is made by New York toymaker Jailbreak Toys and is set for release on November 20, but the company began work on the new product six or seven months ago, according to Jason Feinberg, Jailbreak Toys' 32-year-old founder. ""The entire political scene was a little rosier at the time,"" Feinberg said in a phone interview, ""But what was really apparent was the country, and really the world at large, were very enamored of this lady."" Feinberg, whose company began selling a Barack Obama action-figure doll in mid-2008, said that Michelle Obama's ""energy"" was ""muted, subdued, classy"" coming out of last year's campaign while her husband's image was much more like that of a superhero. The new Michelle Obama doll is available in three outfits: the purple dress worn when the Obamas shared their famous fist bump during the campaign, the red and black dress she wore on Election Night and the black-and-white floral dress she wore during an appearance on ""The View."" All three dolls show Michelle Obama in a sheath dress and with bare arms, attributes that have become personal trademarks during her tenure as first lady. Feinberg said his target audience for the new doll is not children but adults ""who collected toys as a child, who haven't lost that kind of whimsical enthusiasm."" Like Jailbreak's Barack Obama doll, the new Michelle Obama doll will retail for $12.99, according to Feinberg. Katie McCormick Lelyveld, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said in an e-mail to CNN that the White House had no comment on the new doll. When the company behind Beanie Babies began selling dolls named ""Marvelous Malia and Sweet Sasha"" soon after Inauguration Day, the White House had a swift and strong reaction. ""We feel it is inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes,"" the first lady's spokeswoman said at the time.",0.63268167,8876
153,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will welcome Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for an official state visit Tuesday. The two leaders will discuss a range of global, regional and bilateral issues, the White House said. Those discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan, climate change and nuclear energy cooperation. Singh has been quoted as saying that a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would be disastrous for Central and South Asia. Singh's visit will be the first state visit hosted by the administration, the highest honor extended to a foreign dignitary. It will be Singh's second visit to Washington; he has also met with former President George W. Bush. Grammy- and Oscar-award-winning singer and actress Jennifer Hudson will entertain the black-tie crowd, several sources involved in the planning outside the administration said. Hudson, raised in Chicago like first lady Michelle Obama, sang the National Anthem at the Democratic National Convention in August 2008 at the request of the Obama campaign, when Obama became the Democratic presidential nominee. Singh arrived Sunday for his five-day visit. On Monday, he attended a luncheon hosted by the U.S.-India Business Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He addressed the Council on Foreign Relations later in the day. Obama will receive the prime minister at the White House on Tuesday, and Singh and his wife will be the guests at an official state dinner Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Singh will meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates and will later attend a reception for the Indian community hosted by Indian Ambassador to the United States Meera Shankar. Singh will leave Washington Thursday morning and fly to Port of Spain, Trinidad, to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit.

154,"(Mental Floss) -- In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January. President Bush's dog Barney, left, plays in 2001 with Spot, the offspring of George H.W. Bush's dog Millie. It's a good thing Obama said ""Yes, we can"" to the girls' request to getting a dog; for all of his charm, ability, and oratorical flair, he could never be our nation's chief executive without a White House pet. Counting Obama, the country has had 44 Presidents, and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets. Like Obama himself, the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill. Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high. iReport.com: What pet would you want if you lived in the White House? Here are a few of our favorites:  Watch Obama on ""mutts like me"" » . 1. Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus . Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets. After taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections. He had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo » . Billy was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age. He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.) Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success. He sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring. Mental Floss: 7 crafty zoo escapes . 2. The White House gators . Herbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, and ... a gator in the Oval Office? It's true. Hoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds. Sound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests. 3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion . What do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog. In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend. FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala. After that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went. The dog ""gave"" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala. Fala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone. ""You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious. ""He has not been the same dog since!"" Fala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952. Mental Floss: 6 utterly loyal dogs . 4. Millie: Literary sensation . When George H.W. Bush took office in 1989, he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House. The bubbly canine won over the nation's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush. Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989. Just as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House, so did Millie: when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office, so did his dog, Millie's son Spot Fetcher. 5. Barney, Miss Beazley & India: The current residents . Sadly, Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004, but the Bushes aren't pet-deprived now. They have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley, both of whom have websites and appear in White House-produced web videos. (Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by ""Willie.""  Watch Barney bite a reporter » . The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs ""Bush."" The name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben ""El Indio"" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher. Other first pets of note: . Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers. Pauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption. Old Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco. Laddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 ""interview"" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs. Liberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations. Socks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie. Gamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House. Two tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo. Satan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno. Jonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name, he wrote to a friend, ""partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear's character."" Dr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs. Josiah -- Roosevelt also had a pet badger, of course. Bonus trivia: Checkers . Nixon's dog was immortalized in the ""Checkers speech,"" which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions. He said the only gift he'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters. Mental Floss: Why was the 'Checkers speech' so important? Checkers, however, was never the White House dog. This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 election, and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket. Although the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House, Checkers never got to be First Dog; he passed away in 1964. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

155,"(CNN) -- Chevy Chase didn't look like Gerald Ford and didn't sound like Gerald Ford. But in the mid-1970s, when ""Saturday Night Live"" first went on the air, Chase -- then a writer and cast member of the show -- made his impression of the president, rife with pratfalls and slapstick, the talk of the country. He also made the president a butt of jokes, which was intentional, Chase told CNN in an interview. ""[Ford] was a sweet man, a terrific man -- [we] became good friends after, but ... he just tripped over things a lot,"" he said. ""It's not that I can imitate him so much that I can do a lot of physical comedy and I just made it, I just went after him. And ... obviously my leanings were Democratic and I wanted [Jimmy] Carter in and I wanted [Ford] out, and I figured look, we're reaching millions of people every weekend, why not do it."" Over the years, ""Saturday Night Live's"" political satires have become a mainstay of the show, sometimes to startling effect.  Watch Chase talk about ""SNL's"" impact » . Al Franken -- now the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate from Minnesota -- and his then writing partner, Tom Davis, wrote a wicked takeoff of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book, ""The Final Days,"" which included Dan Aykroyd as a bitter Richard Nixon and John Belushi as a toadying Henry Kissinger. In the mid-'80s, a sketch starring Phil Hartman as Ronald Reagan showed the president, often lampooned as forgetful, with a razor-sharp command of the Iran-Contra situation, cutting deals in Arabic and barking orders at his staff. More recently, Dana Carvey's malaprop-laden impression of George H.W. Bush, Hartman's puppy-dog Bill Clinton, Will Ferrell's George W. Bush and Tina Fey's Sarah Palin have embedded themselves in the culture. Though Chase believes the show leans left, and Fey's Palin is an attempt to hurt the Republicans, Marc Liepis, NBC Universal senior director of late night publicity, had no comment. Certainly, ""SNL"" -- which began as one of the old '60s counterculture's first forays into network TV -- has also mocked Democrats. Indeed, sketches about the Democratic debates in the spring, one of which portrayed the media as fawning over Barack Obama, gave Hillary Clinton ammunition in her pursuit of the nomination. The writer of that sketch, Jim Downey, has been described as leaning conservative, though he was quoted in a March New York Times article as calling himself a registered Democrat. In the same article, ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels said, ""We don't lay down for anybody."" Chase talked about his Ford impression and the political impact of ""Saturday Night Live"" with CNN's Alina Cho. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: Let's go back to '76. Chevy Chase:  It was Gerald Ford that was president but hadn't been elected and was running again and I just ... CNN: Some people say he was an accidental president and you made him accident prone. Chase: Actually, he was accident prone and he was a sweet man, a terrific man, became good friends later, and a relatively good athlete in college too ... but he just tripped over things a lot. ... You know, after a while, you just start writing the jokes and start doing it. So it's not that I can imitate him so much that I can do a lot of physical comedy, and I just made it, I just went after him. And I certainly, obviously my leanings were Democratic and I wanted Carter in and I wanted [Ford] out and I figured look, we're reaching millions of people every weekend, why not do it. CNN: You mean to tell me in the back of your mind you were thinking, hey I want Carter ... Chase: Oh, yeah. CNN: And I'm going to make him look bad. Chase: Oh yeah. What do you think they're doing now, you think they're just doing this because Sarah's funny? No, I think that the show is very much more Democratic and liberal-oriented, that they are obviously more for Barack Obama. [In the '70s], out of the Nixon era, and it was not unlikely that I might go that direction. CNN: I talked to one political pundit who said, I think Chevy Chase cost Ford the presidency. Chase: When you have that kind of a venue and power where you can reach so many millions of people and you've become a show that people watch, you know, you can affect a lot of people, and humor does it beautifully, because humor is perspective and has a way of making judgment calls. ... So I think there was no question that it had major effect and in fact, in speaking with his family and then later him, and even reading some of his books ... he felt so, too. CNN: What do you think of Tina Fey's portrayal of Sarah Palin? Chase: I think it's actually very spot on. ... I think, though, what Tina is saying is -- and she has also admitted it -- ""This woman is not a dumb woman, she's a smart woman, so am I, Tina Fey. Neither of us are smart enough to be the president, though."" CNN: So having said that, what do you think then the impact is? You touched on your impact on Ford and his presidency ... Chase: I think more now then ever the impact is great because of how much larger the impact of the media is generally on people's lives, all sorts of media. ... I mean so there's so many outlets, but people just spend so much of their time in front of their computers and watching television in their computer. CNN: Is [""SNL's"" politics] fair? Chase: Fair? What do you mean fair? They're an all-purpose comedy show. Of course it's fair, it's satire, it's what it is, and it's fair, if you have your own television show, to give your own opinion. ... They didn't let Barack off the hook a lot either, you know, when they said, ""Is there anything you would like sir, a little more coffee. ... "" Of course it's fair.

156,"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Fans of porn star Stormy Daniels are drafting her to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana now held by Republican Sen. David Vitter.

The Draft Stormy Web site says that ""2010 presents the Pelican State with the opportunity to start with a clean slate -- to elect a representative that we can be proud of, who will work tirelessly, and who will challenge the status quo. We at the Draft Stormy campaign feel that Baton Rouge native Stormy Daniels is best suited to fulfill these duties."" Vitter is famous -- or infamous -- for his link to the ""D.C. Madam,"" the woman who ran a prostitution ring. Elected to the Senate in 2004, he admitted to ""a very serious sin in my past"" in July 2007 after his phone number turned up in records of an escort service run by the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the D.C. Madam. Running for re-election, Vitter said his wife has forgiven him and is banking on the same sentiment from his constituents. Will the Draft Stormy move mean stormy weather for Vitter? The senator's office didn't return calls by CNN. But a spokesman for the state GOP said voters ""are concerned with real issues that affect their everyday lives and not with political or publicity stunts."" The Draft Stormy campaign was started by New Orleans resident and Daniels fan Zack Hudson, who insists it's for real. Daniels, 29, isn't affiliated with a party but is embracing the idea of a possible candidacy.  Watch the adult entertainment star talk about a possible run » . She said she's planning a ""listening tour"" around Louisiana to talk about a range of matters, including the economy -- which along with women in business and protection of children are the three issues listed on her Web site. When told Vitter can be a tough opponent, she said she's ""always up for a good fight."" ""I think anyone that knows me ... is more than aware of that,"" Daniels said. ""Politics can't be any dirtier of a job than the one I am already in."" According to a capsule bio on the Draft Stormy Web site, Daniels has been ""breaking barriers and shattering glass ceilings her entire life,"" serving as editor of her high school newspaper and president of her school's 4-H Club and eventually transferring ""her determination and talents to the professional level, becoming a featured performer in the adult entertainment industry."" Another stride was ""signing an exclusive contract with the video production company Wicked Pictures, a company committed to a health and safety first policy, as pertaining to its video performances. Stormy's decision to sign with Wicked highlighted her commitment to sending a positive message to young people of the importance of practicing safe sex,"" the bio said. Daniels has directed films for the company, won awards for writing, directing and acting, and has appeared in mainstream films such as ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" ""Originally, the focus wasn't even about making me as a candidate,"" Daniels said. ""I think it was about bringing attention to the Senate race in general. Then the response was overwhelmingly positive. And I think everyone is just running with it."" While her political aspirations may be a light diversion for Louisiana voters, reality will set in if Daniels tangles with Vitter. Clancy DuBos, political director of the New Orleans alternative newspaper Gambit, said Vitter is a brilliant politician with a campaign war chest worth $2 million. If the Daniels campaign is meant to remind voters of Vitter's D.C. Madam link, the move could backfire, DuBos said. ""You are going to need someone better than a porn star, or a lap dancer, or a sex worker to nail David Vitter on this,"" he said. ""You need a serious opponent who is himself, or herself, not guilty of something like that to say, 'Let's talk about family values, shall we?' "" The Draft Stormy movement said Daniels' ""real world experience and special understanding of the economic hardships facing Louisianans and Americans make her uniquely qualified to take on the tough challenges we face.

157,"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Friday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown praises Mark Felt, the Watergate case's ""Deep Throat."" (CNN) -- Cutting through the bull. It's hard to think of anyone who gave those words more meaning than Mark Felt. The man we all came to know as ""Deep Throat"" died Thursday at his California home after a life in the shadows. His willingness to risk everything -- career, family, and even his safety -- helped bring down President Richard Nixon in disgrace. Felt was the No. 2 man at the FBI. And yes, it's fair to say he had an ax to grind after being snubbed for the top job.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary » . But that didn't make his information less accurate or crucial. And even after taking that huge risk, he gave up all kinds of chances to cash in on his secret identity. Imagine the book deal ""Deep Throat"" would have gotten or the movie rights to a blockbuster like ""All the President's Men""? What millions did he lose by not spending years on the lecture circuit? No, Felt's willingness to keep Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward pointed in the right direction as Woodward and Carl Bernstein flushed out the greatest political scandal in American history had its roots in the integrity that no one else would show back then. We remind you of this because the timing of Felt's death is not lost on us. Just this month, we've watched a governor accused of redefining crooked politics in Illinois. We're in the final days of a White House that pushed the limits of the Constitution and never appeared eager to share information with the American people. And just this week, the president-elect, who talks of change, tried to stop a journalist from finishing a question at a news conference. Now, as ever, we need people like Woodward and Bernstein to keep asking questions. But more importantly, we need people brave enough to give the answers. People like Mark Felt. A man whose name you never heard until he finally surfaced near the end of his life. By then, he was a quiet, meek-looking person who changed our country forever -- by cutting through the bull.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: One ship, two pirate attacks, different outcome this time around.  You'll see it in today's show! I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Senate Health Care Plan . AZUZ: First up, the Senate has come up with its plan to reform the U.S. health care system. The proposed bill, released last night. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says it would give health insurance to 30 million more Americans and would cost an estimated $849 billion over the next 10 years. Some senators now opposed to the bill are concerned about what it covers and how much it costs. Republicans have threatened to try and block the legislation from being passed. Debate on it could start as soon as Saturday. Afghan Inauguration . AZUZ: Hamid Karzai is scheduled to be sworn in today for his second term as the president of Afghanistan. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says this is a ""critical moment"" for that country, because it's a chance for Karzai to show what kind of government he'll lead. Clinton is visiting Afghanistan right now. She's scheduled to meet with Karzai while she's there. The Afghan president, under pressure to clean up corruption in his government, and Secretary Clinton is expected to talk with him about some guidelines that Afghanistan will have to meet in order to continue getting aid from the U.S. Clinton says that America wants to be partners with Afghanistan and with the Afghan people, and that is why President Obama has been reviewing the U.S. approach to the country. Nuclear Fears . AZUZ: No deal! That's what Iran seems to be saying about sending some of its nuclear materials to other countries. This plan was worked out at a meeting last month. Iran would send raw nuclear materials to other nations who would make it into nuclear fuel, and then that would go back to Iran to be used in medical facilities. But now, instead of sending out materials and getting them back later as fuel, one Iranian official is saying the country will only swap raw materials for already processed fuel, and the trade would have to happen in Iran.  All this is part of the ongoing tension over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. Iran says it's only being used for peaceful reasons. But other countries believe Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons. Terror Trial Debate . AZUZ: Well, there has been a lot of back-and-forth about the Obama Administration's decision to try a group of suspected 9/11 terrorists in a civilian court in New York City. A lot of people spoke out about this on our blog and in Congress, where Attorney General Eric Holder, who made the decision, talked about it yesterday. Samantha Hayes has our report on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a move that's sparked a raging debate. ALICE HOAGLAND, MOTHER OF 9/11 VICTIM: I think I can speak for many 9/11 families when I say that we are heartsick. HAYES: On Capitol Hill Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder defended his decision to try five suspected 9/11 terrorists -- including alleged mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed -- in a civilian court, not a military tribunal. ERIC HOLDER, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: It was a decision that was case-driven. It's a decision based on the evidence that I know, that frankly, some of the people who have criticized the decision do not have access to. HAYES: Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee led the intense criticism of Holder's decision. SENATOR JON KYL, (R) ARIZONA: How could you be more likely to get a conviction in federal court when Khalid Sheik Mohammed has already asked to plead guilty before a military commission and be executed? HAYES: But Democrats who support the move expressed confidence in the court system and the ability of the city of New York to handle the trials, even though it was the epicenter of the 9/11 attacks. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D) CALIFORNIA: I happen to believe that New York City is able to handle this in a very professional and definitively legal manner. HAYES: And Holder said it in no way undermines the administration's commitment to fighting terror. HOLDER: We are at war, and we will use every instrument of national power -- civilian, military, law enforcement, intelligence, diplomatic and others -- to win. HAYES: Holder also told the panel that he is not concerned that a federal court could find the suspected terrorists not guilty. He said he has told prosecutors that these are cases that must be won.

MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. VandenHeuval's social studies classes at Dos Rios Elementary School in Tolleson, Arizona! Who is the longest-serving member in the history of the U.S. Congress? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Robert Byrd, B) Strom Thurmond, C) Harry Reid or D) Ted Stevens? You've got three seconds -- GO! Today is Senator Robert Byrd's 20,775th day serving in Congress. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Congressional History . AZUZ: Six years in the House of Representatives; elected to the U.S. Senate nine terms -- only person ever to do that -- it makes Sen. Byrd's total time representing residents of West Virginia 51 years so far. Plus, he's turning 92 tomorrow. As he became the longest-serving member of Congress yesterday, Byrd's years of service were praised by Democrats and Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about Sen. Byrd's love for both the country and the Congress. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted that many of Byrd's records will never be broken. Somalia Pirates . AZUZ: Deja vu in waters off the coast of the African nation of Somalia, when pirates tried to hijack a ship called the Maersk Alabama. If that sounds familiar to you, it's because that was the same ship that was hijacked back in April. A Navy operation rescued the crew members in that incident. And yesterday, a private security team on board the Maersk kept the attempted hijackers from taking over. When we talk about pirates, we don't mean ""of the Caribbean."" These are very dangerous people with guns; they hold ships for ransom; they're very active in this part of the world. Is this Legit? MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The African elephant is the largest animal on land. This one's true. These animals can grow to be 9 tons; that's 18,000 pounds! Elephant Orphanage . AZUZ: Okay -- that's the full-grown version, but even the babies are huge! African elephants can still weigh around 220 pounds at birth! But big doesn't necessarily mean safe. They're losing their habitat; they're being hunted by poachers: Baby elephants can face a lot of threats in the wild, and not having a mother around doesn't make it any easier. David McKenzie examines a program in Kenya that's trying to help orphaned elephants. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They grow up to be one of Africa's giants, but like all creatures, they start off pretty small. Dwarfed by their keepers, each orphaned elephant at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has a tragic tale. This is Sala. She's 6 weeks old. They say her mother died because of starvation in the Kenyan drought. The person who found her gave her cow's milk, which is extremely harmful to elephants because of the fat. Sala wandered into a tourist camp in Kenya's Sala National Park, alone and confused. The orphanage scrambled a plane to rescue her. Carefully strapped in and traumatized, they evacuated Sala to Nairobi. For weeks, she was too sick to stand. Three days ago, she started walking again. If she makes it, she won't be alone. Drought, poaching and shrinking habitats have decimated elephant herds across East Africa. And the orphanage is fuller than it's been in 30 years. Still, Dame Daphne Sheldrick will take more. DAME DAPHNE SHELDRICK, DAVID SHELDRICK WILDLIFE TRUST: Whatever comes in, we have to make space. MCKENZIE: It takes years to rehabilitate and reintroduce the orphans into the wild. For the keepers, it's not just a 9 to 5 job. EDWIN LUSICHI, CHIEF KEEPER: But after working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job. It is from inside your heart, the love that you have for these animals. MCKENZIE: Every three hours, day and night, the keepers mix fortified soy milk for the elephants. It costs $900 a month to care for each orphan, so the elephants have to earn their keep. With a slap of sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin, the babies go on parade. They slush and slide for the throngs of tourists who see the fun, but not the heartbreak. MCKENZIE: So, they hope to lead these infants through their most fragile stage. It could take years before Sala joins a family of wild elephants. In the care of her human family, she might just make it. David McKenzie, CNN, Nairobi, Kenya. (END VIDEO) Impact Your World .

159,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush's top adviser on homeland security is stepping down after 4½ years on the job, the White House said Monday. Fran Townsend served more than four years as homeland security adviser. Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend turned in her letter of resignation to President Bush on November 6 and will be looking for new opportunities outside government. ""I'm going to just take another job doing 20-hour days, but this time in the private sector,"" said Townsend, who has spent 25 years working in law enforcement and government. Bush praised Townsend's work Monday. ""Fran has always provided wise counsel on how to best protect the American people from the threat of terrorism,"" Bush said in a statement. ""We are safer today because of her leadership."" Townsend's job, as the president's top adviser on fighting terrorism, involved identifying terrorist groups around the globe and assessing their threat, and finding ways to track and cut off their funding. She said that experience should will be useful in the private sector as well. Townsend -- the mother of two, ages 6 and 12 -- said she first will look into public speaking, writing and board work before pursuing opportunities in global risk management for a large multinational corporation or financial institution.  Watch how Townsend is planning to use her skills » . She said she's been talking with the president about her planned departure for eight months. Townsend's name had come up during the president's recent search for a new attorney general, but she was not considered. She said not getting the job ""had absolutely nothing to do with her decision to leave."" She said Bush had wanted her to stay on in his administration. ""It was a hard decision as I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service,"" she said in an e-mail. ""My family actually advocated that I remain and has always been supportive of my service so this was entirely my decision."" Townsend is part of the search committee to find a replacement by the beginning of next year. The president appoints the senior staff position, and it needs no Senate confirmation.

160,"(CNN) -- Actor and filmmaker Joe Pantoliano, known for his role as Ralph Cifaretto on the HBO series ""The Sopranos,"" attended the Democratic National Convention on Monday to raise awareness about people living with mental illness. Joe Pantoliano has met with the Obama and McCain camps to promote mental health and recovery. Pantoliano, founder and president of the eight-month-old advocacy organization No Kidding, Me Too, released a teaser of his new film about various forms of mental illness. At the CNN Grill, he answered five questions for CNN.com. CNN.com: What are you doing out here in Denver? Pantoliano: I've always been fascinated by the political process ever since I was a kid. ... I always love the festive partying, the camaraderie, the working for the candidate, whether it was somebody in the 3rd Ward where I lived in New Jersey in Hoboken or a senator or a congressman or even when a president would come. I remember when President Kennedy came down to Hoboken in '61 and I was only 10 years old. I was with the Kennedys tonight. CNN.com: Are you a Barack Obama supporter? Pantoliano: I'm advocating my organization. I'm going to the [Republican National Convention} next week. I'm speaking on mental illness and the miracles of recovery; that's what the movie is about. I've met with the Obama chief of staff and the Obama people; I've met with McCain people. Mental illness is on the tip of their minds. CNN.com: Who are you voting for? Pantoliano: I don't know yet.  Watch how celebrity endorsements can backfire » . CNN.com: Where are the hot spots in Denver? Where are people hanging out? Pantoliano: Here, the CNN Grill. It's all they're talking about. I really like Denver. The security is less kinetic [than] it was four years ago. That whole fear thing that this administration has played on our nerves; I think I have post-traumatic stress over that. What happened was I became addicted to the news. iReport.com: Are you in Denver? Share sights, sounds . CNN.com: Do you think that coming out to a convention helps you make up your mind better than sitting in your living room? Pantoliano: I'm an independent. I can be inspired tonight by Michelle Obama's speech, and then something happens next week, so I'm going back and forth. I'm a flip-flopper. The difference that I see between the Republicans and the Democrats are that the Democrats really are a force of what the melting pot of our society is. Obama really represents that.

161,"(CNN) -- Jody Powell, who served as press secretary for President Jimmy Carter, has died, a spokesman for the Carter Center said. He was 65. Former White House Press Secretary Jody Powell died Monday. Powell, who served in the Carter administration from 1977 to 1981, died Monday of an apparent heart attack, Carter Center spokesman Tony Clark told CNN. Carter said he and former first lady Rosalynn Carter ""share a great personal loss today in the passing of Jody Powell."" ""From the time he began, as a young graduate student, as my volunteer driver during my 1970 run for governor, no one worked more closely with me than Jody,"" the former president and former governor of Georgia said in a statement.

162,"(Mental Floss) -- President-Elect Obama's mother-in-law will be moving to Washington with the first family, at least temporarily, his transition team has confirmed. Marian Robinson will be the latest in a line of presidential in-laws who, for good or ill, lived under the same roof as the president. President Dwight Eisenhower and his mother-in-law, Elivera  Doud, pose for pictures with some of the grandchildren. Here are four stories that confirm the old truism: While America can choose its president, the president can't choose his in-laws. 1. Ulysses S. Grant and 'The Colonel' You would think that the Civil War was settled at Appomattox, and no question of its outcome would have been raised in the White House of Ulysses S. Grant, who, after all, was the general who won the war. But you would be wrong, because living with Ulysses and Julia Grant was the president's father-in-law. Colonel Frederick Dent (his rank seems to have been self-selected) was an unreconstructed Confederate, a St. Louis businessman and slaveholder who, when his daughter Julia went to the Executive Mansion early in 1869, decided to relocate there as well. The Colonel didn't hesitate to make himself at home. When his daughter received guests, he sat in a chair just behind her, offering anyone within earshot unsolicited advice. Political and business figures alike got a dose of the Colonel's mind as they waited to meet with President Grant. When the president's father, Jesse Grant, came from Kentucky on one of his regular visits to Washington, the White House turned into a Civil War reenactment. According to ""First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives"", by Bonnie Angelo, Jesse Grant preferred to stay in a hotel rather than sleep under the same roof as the Colonel. And when the two old partisans found themselves unavoidably sitting around the same table in the White House, they avoided direct negotiations by using Julia and her young son, named for the president's father, as intermediaries, Betty Boyd Caroli writes in ""First Ladies"": ""In the presence of the elder Grant, Frederick Dent would instruct Julia to 'take better care of that old gentleman [Jesse Grant]. He is feeble and deaf as a post and yet you permit him to wander all over Washington alone.' And Grant replied [to his grandson and namesake], 'Did you hear him? I hope I shall not live to become as old and infirm as your Grandfather Dent.'"" Mental Floss: 5 feisty first daughters . The Colonel remained in the White House -- irascible and unrepentant -- until his death, at age 88, in 1873. 2. Harry S Truman and the Mother-in-Law from Heck . Harry Truman and Bess Wallace met as children. He was a farm boy; she was the well-heeled granddaughter of Independence, Missouri's Flour King. When they married in 1919, Truman was a struggling haberdasher, and Bess's mother, Madge Wallace, thought Bess had made a colossal social faux pas. Until she died in 1952, Madge Wallace never changed her mind about Harry Truman. Her Bess had married way below her station. Madge had plenty of opportunities to let her son-in-law know it. The newlyweds moved into the Wallace mansion in Independence, and the three lived together under the same roof until the end of Madge's life. When Harry Truman was elected senator, ""Mother Wallace,"" as Truman judiciously called her, moved with her daughter and son-in-law to Washington. In the family's apartment, she shared a bedroom with the Trumans' daughter, Margaret. And when Truman became president, she moved with them into the White House, where she cast her cold eye on the new commander-in-chief. ""Why would Harry run against that nice Mr. Dewey?"" she wondered aloud, as Truman was fighting for his political life in the 1948 presidential race, according to ""First Mothers"" by Bonnie Angelo. And when Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for insubordination, Mother Wallace was scandalized. ""Imagine a captain from the National Guard [Truman] telling off a West Point general!"" In December 1952, shortly before Truman's term ended, Madge Wallace died, at age 90. For the 33 years they lived together, she never called her son-in-law anything but ""Mr. Truman"" to his face. Mental Floss: Presidential siblings and the headaches they caused . 3. Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Mother-in-Law of the Year . If Truman's story sounds like the set-up for a film noir, his successor's relationship with his mother-in-law might have been a Technicolor musical. Elivera Mathilda Carlson Doud, Mamie Eisenhower's mother, was ""a witty woman with a tart tongue,"" Time magazine wrote, and Dwight Eisenhower thought she was a hoot. ""She refuted every mother-in-law joke ever made,"" Time wrote. There was no question that she would join her daughter and son-in-law in the White House. Ike called her ""Min,"" the name of a character in the Andy Gump comic strip. Ike and Min ""constituted a mutual admiration society, and each took the other's part whenever a family disagreement would arise,"" said Eisenhower's son, John. The New York Times observed, ""The president frequently looks around him sharply, and inquires, 'Where's Min?'"" Widowed shortly before Eisenhower became president, Min spent the winters in the White House and summers at her home in Denver. It was while visiting his mother-in-law's home that Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in 1955. Two years later, in failing health, Min returned permanently to Denver. She died in 1960, at age 82. 4. Benjamin Harrison and the Reverend Doctor . Benjamin Harrison's father-in-law, John Witherspoon Scott, bore a double title: ""reverend doctor."" Scott was born in Pennsylvania in 1800, did post-graduate work at Yale and took a professorship in mathematics and science at Miami University, in Ohio. He was also a Presbyterian minister and an outspoken abolitionist. The reverend doctor was rumored to have shielded runaway slaves in his home as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Whatever the truth, Miami University dismissed him for his anti-slavery beliefs. He accepted a post at Farmer's College, a prep school in Cincinnati, where he became a mentor of a student named Benjamin Harrison. During his visits to the Scott home, Harrison became friendly with the reverend doctor's daughter, Caroline. Young Harrison spent so many evenings at the Scotts' home that he got the nickname ""the pious moonlight dude,"" according to ""The Complete Book of the Presidents"" by William A. DeGregorio. He and Caroline were married in 1853 at the bride's house. The reverend doctor officiated. John Witherspoon Scott later became a clerk in the pension office of the interior department. He gave up the position when Harrison was elected president in 1888. A widower since 1876, Scott moved into the White House with his daughter and their family. It was the president's custom to lead the family in a half-hour of Bible reading and prayer after breakfast, Anne Chieko Moore and Hester Anne Hale wrote in ""Benjamin Harrison: Centennial President."" When the president was absent, his father-in-law took his place. Caroline Harrison died in October 1892, two weeks before her husband lost the presidential election. Her father died the next month, at age 92. An obituary described John Witherspoon Scott as ""a man of wonderful physical vigor, tall, broad chested and well preserved mentally.""

163,"(CNN) -- Rick Warren, founder and pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, is one of America's most influential authors and religious leaders. In August, he moderated a discussion on key issues between presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. Rick Warren says no matter what problem you have, there's a purpose behind it. His latest book is ""The Purpose of Christmas."" He was interviewed by Kiran Chetry on ""American Morning"" on Friday. Here is an edited version of the exchange: . Chetry: We always say we don't want Christmas to be commercialized. It seems that at the end of the year, we end up in the same position, worried about buying presents, worried about spending money, worried about holiday cards, and how do you get back to the real meaning? Rick Warren: A lot of people are really hurting because of the economy and because of the fears about what's going to happen, and really those same problems are the problems that Mary and Joseph went through. Housing, no room at the inn, travel, economic unrest, things like that. So I wrote this book really to focus us on what is the true meaning of Christmas. It's a book of hope, and the big idea behind it is that no matter what problem you're going through, there's a purpose behind it. God has a purpose, and that purpose can help you make it through even the stressful times when we decide to write a note to everybody, buy a gift for everybody, redecorate our house, have five or six meals and go to eight or nine parties.  Rick Warren: Shop more or pray more? » . Chetry: Exactly, because that's usually what ends up happening, and sometimes the spirit of giving and fellowship is lost in that. You also write in the book, remember that God loves you, but for somebody who is facing foreclosure -- let's say you lost a loved one or your job or dealing with an illness -- it can sound pat in a way. What do you say to people who say, pastor, I don't feel that God loves me or I wouldn't be going through this . Warren: Actually, sometimes what we think is a problem is actually a protection. For instance, last month my daughter-in-law, who is 25 years old, went through a brain tumor. She had her first child premature, about six weeks early, and when she had that baby early, it was breech. The cord was wrapped around its neck and it stopped breathing and they actually had to do an emergency C-section and resuscitate the child and save the baby's life and save her life. We looked at that and we thought, boy, that's a pretty tough problem, but we now know that she had a three-inch brain tumor at the base of her brainstem, and if she had pushed, it would have killed her. And so actually, seven weeks later, when she should have been delivering the baby, we discovered the brain tumor, and she would have been trying to have brain surgery, three surgeries, one was 20 hours long, at the same time as having a baby. So what we thought was a problem was actually a protection saving her life. And sometimes, we look at a tapestry, and from the top down, you can see the picture. From the bottom up, it's all of these different colors of threads. It makes no sense. It's all jumbled. When God looks down, he sees what he's doing. When we look up, we just see the jumble. Chetry: And she's OK? Warren: She's OK. Chetry: Thank goodness. I want to turn to politics now and ask you about the summit you hosted for both of the candidates. Great provocative questions and interesting answers we weren't hearing on the campaign trail. Now that the campaign is over, what is your reaction to the outcome and to President-elect Barack Obama? Warren: Well, there's no doubt about it, we need to be praying for our president. I don't think any president has come into a crisis so quickly as President-elect Obama has, and no president has come in with probably as high expectations as President-elect Obama. So we need to pray for him. We need to support him where we can, and we need -- we want the best for America. Chetry: Religion factored heavily into some of the back-and-forth in the campaign season. Many people believed [incorrectly] that Barack Obama wasn't really Christian, that he was Muslim, and, of course, the Jeremiah Wright thing. Religion ended up, unfortunately, being a divisive issue at times as opposed to one that was a uniting issue. How do you change that? Warren: Part of it is we have to end the caricaturization of the candidates. I know all of the candidates on both sides, and none of them were exactly as they were portrayed. We tend to overportray them whether it's Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John McCain. They're not anything like the caricaturization that we often hear. We tend to push to extremes. They are a lot more practical and pragmatic, I think, than we want to give them credit for, and every president, when he becomes president, has to let go of some ideology and become more of a pragmatist because there's so many issues that you don't probably understand until you actually hold the office.",0.62374175,4545

America is divided by economics, and we as Americans, we've got to do a better job of supporting poor people. CNN.com: How? Barkley: We've got to improve the public school system.

165,"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published in December by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. President Obama is taking a huge step in his presidency. After weeks of careful deliberation, the president has sided with military officials who have been pushing for an escalation of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Explaining his objectives and exit strategy, Obama is expected to announce that he will be sending 30,000 troops, and possibly more, into the region. With this decision, Obama inches closer to becoming a wartime president. Even though the White House insists that they will continue to work hard on their domestic agenda, historically, presidents who become involved in protracted ground wars find that their presidencies are defined by their military conflicts. The politics that surround a military operation play an enormous role in the political success or failure of an administration. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and many congressional Democrats realize the human and political risks that come from this war. As news broke of President Obama's decision, Pelosi said: ""the American people believe that if something is in our national security interest, we have to be able to afford it. That doesn't mean that we hold everything else"" stagnant because of those operations. But war sucks the political oxygen out of almost any presidency. There have been several modern presidents who started their term with an ambitious domestic vision and who ended up with their presidencies totally consumed by war. President Harry Truman, who served from 1945 to 1953, pulled off a historic upset in his reelection bid against Thomas Dewey in 1948. In the campaign, Truman castigated a ""do-nothing"" Congress. When he returned to the White House after the election, Truman fought for an ambitious domestic agenda in 1949 and 1950, which he called the Fair Deal, which included national health care, civil rights, fair housing and more. While a conservative coalition of southern Democrats and Republicans in Congress defeated most of his proposals, it was the Korean War, which began in the summer of 1950, that brought down his presidency. When the military operations against North Korea bogged down into a stalemate by 1951, Republicans ripped into the administration for refusing to use enough air power against the communists. Truman, whose approval ratings plummeted to 23 percent by 1952, decided that he should not run for reelection. ""If we had been less trusting, if we had been less soft and weak, there would probably have been no war in Korea!"" Republican candidate and military hero Gen. Dwight Eisenhower said on the campaign trail. Republicans focused their campaign on Korea, Communism and corruption. The Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, lost; Republicans gained control of Congress. President Lyndon Johnson was on the verge of becoming a transformative president in the winter of 1965. Since taking office, Johnson had presided over the passage of a sweeping body of domestic measures unequaled by almost any president in American history other than Franklin Roosevelt. His accomplishments included Medicare and Medicaid, federal education assistance, civil rights and voting rights, environmental regulations, immigration reform and much more. Yet all those accomplishments seemed to disappear in the political psyche after the ""Americanization"" of the war in the spring of 1965, when Johnson authorized a vast increase of ground troops to Vietnam. By 1968, public opinion had turned against the war, with anti-war protesters organizing against ""Johnson's War."" In the history books, Vietnam has swamped our memory of Johnson's presidency and eclipsed much of what he accomplished in those early years. ""That bitch of a war,"" Johnson lamented toward the end of his life, ""killed the lady I really loved -- the Great Society."" Most recently, there was the experience of President George W. Bush. During the 2000 campaign and in the early months of his presidency, Bush pushed for a type of ""compassionate conservatism"" that sought to extend certain kinds of government programs and establish the framework for a broad Republican coalition that captured the center and right. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 extended the reach of the federal government into the nation's grade schools. After 9/11, Bush led a successful operation to knock the Taliban out of power in Afghanistan and dramatically reorganized homeland security. But once Bush sent troops to Iraq to bring down Saddam Hussein in 2003, the war came to dominate everything else. As the reconstruction of Iraq proved to be much more difficult than the White House anticipated, Bush's popularity plummeted. In 2006, Democrats took control of Congress and in 2008 Barack Obama, on a platform defined by his opposition to Iraq, was elected president. There are modern presidents who have balanced their agendas and preserved domestic policy as an integral part of their political identity even after having sent troops to war. This was the certainly the case with FDR who protected many of his domestic programs and even expanded government into new areas at home as the war unfolded. But FDR is an exception to the rule. Soon Obama will be significantly expanding an existing military operation, making this war his own. In doing so, he will be risking a huge amount of his potential impact as a president. To make matters even worse, unlike Johnson, Obama has had more trouble pushing much of his domestic agenda through Congress. While he will very likely walk away from this year with a victory on health care, most of his agenda remains bottled up. It is easy to see how Afghanistan can quickly grow in scale and scope. It would be a tragedy if a politician who headed a historic campaign based on the promise of extracting the United States from a very unpopular war would wind up bogged down in a quagmire of his own.

Despite being home to some of the world's poorest nations, Africa has a vibrant cell phone market, considered by industry analysts as among the fastest-growing worldwide.

""Over the past week, we have been collecting questions, comments and words of welcome for President Obama via SMS, Twitter, Facebook and from newspapers across Africa,"" the White House said on its Web site. Three journalists from South Africa, Senegal and Kenya will vet the questions and provide a few to Obama, who will address them on African radio stations and via a Web video Monday, the White House said. Peter Kimani, a senior associate editor for a Kenyan daily, The Standard, is one of the three. ""The U.S. Embassy picked and vetted the journalists, and we are getting the questions, then it is up to us to determine what questions we will forward to the president,"" Kimani said. ""It is our judgment call on what to pick."" Most of the text messages were coming from South Africa, according to a log on the White House Web site. Obama's one-nation visit has generated envy among Ghana's neighbors, who considered it a message from the White House to governments that have poor records of stability.

167,"LONDON (CNN) -- Did President Obama land a Nobel peace prize at such an early stage of his presidency simply because he's not George W. Bush? A ""surprised and humbled"" Obama said he would accept the Nobel peace prize as a ""call to action."" Diplomatic circles are certainly not dismissing such a notion and a ""surprised and humbled"" Obama has himself agreed that the award (for which nominations had to be submitted only two weeks after his inauguration) can hardly have been a recognition of anything he has yet accomplished. It is a prize for aspiration rather than achievement. One of the best deliberate laughs Bush obtained in his last days in office came when he expressed himself pleased at the street reception during his attendance at a NATO summit in Romania. ""A lot of the crowd were waving... some of them with all five fingers,"" he said. Bush was acknowledging that many in Old Europe at least could not wait to say goodbye to a man whom they saw as a Cold Warrior at heart, the president who had led the world into a disastrous intervention in Iraq and a man heading a gas-guzzling nation who was not prepared to help the world cope with climate change. For many Europeans, the chief concern through the long, drawn-out race for the Democratic nomination and through the presidential election was that the result should give them anybody but Bush. Watch reaction in Europe to Obama's award . They were uneasy about his missile defense shield plans to base U.S. military installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. They felt he had never lived up to his pledge to work as hard on the Middle East peace process as Tony Blair had done on bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Especially they felt that the internment camp at Guantanamo Bay and the ""extraordinary rendition"" to countries where terror suspects might have been tortured was an affront to democracy which besmirched the reputation not only of the U.S. but of its allies, too. Europeans were alarmed that Bush seemed to be encouraging the climate change deniers. And although he became readier to listen to his European allies during his second term, they never really took to the man whose instinctive response was to use America's military might in the world's trouble spots rather than to stay at the negotiating table and who had little time for the United Nations. Couple that with the words in the Norwegian Nobel Committee's citation that the peace prize is being awarded to Obama ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"" and that they have ""attached special importance to Obama's vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons,"" and the message is clear. Unusually, this is a world statesman being rewarded not for what he has done but for representing a new beginning. As Mikhail Gorbachev was quick to point out, the Obama presidency is a big signal -- ""He has given hope."" By commenting approvingly that Obama has created a new climate in international politics, with emphasis on the role of diplomacy and of the United Nations, the Nobel Committee is clearly encouraging the new president, after just eight months in office, to continue with a style that Europeans find much more comfortable than that of Bush and the neo-conservatives. Those who worked with Bush are likely to feel aggrieved and to maintain that they, too, were working for the extension of democracy for which Obama is now being commended. As Europe digested the news of the prize, nobody wanted to go public with critical comment on a man who is still seen across Europe as a beacon of hope. But there were off-the-record mutters that this was all somewhat premature. Cool heads were noting that while intentions have been expressed, there has been no significant progress yet on the Middle East peace process. The proposed closedown of Guantanamo Bay has been announced but it has not happened. There are still large numbers of American troops in Iraq and the numbers in Afghanistan are likely to be increased. While Obama has spoken of his hope of agreeing with Russia on a reduction in the number of nuclear warheads, we are nowhere near to seeing an end to nuclear weapons, which are currently in the possession of the U.S., Russia, China, India, the United Kingdom, France, Pakistan and Israel. Obama may want the Senate to ratify the test-ban treaty but that has not happened yet and his moves on climate change, too, will require congressional compliance. The truth, say many continental commentators, is that Obama deserves a badge for effort -- an effort begun by scrapping the missile shield development in Poland and the Czech Republic -- but a peace prize is a step too far at such an early stage. He is being rewarded not for solid achievement but for creating new hope -- in effect, for not being Bush. It may well be, as President Sarkozy of France has declared, that the award ""confirms finally America's return to the hearts of the people of the world."" But some fear that America's conservatives will take it as a sign of weakness and become more obstructive to Obama's aims. Meanwhile, others are wondering: ""What on earth will they give him when he does have a real achievement to point to?""",0.6200215,6721

171,"Editor's note: Ed Rollins, a senior political contributor for CNN, was political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ed Rollins says Jack Kemp's intellect and force of personality helped guide the Republican party. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The world of politics has many players but few giants. One of the giants left the stage last week. I was privileged to have had Jack Kemp as a friend. Our friendship was not unique, because Jack Kemp had thousands and maybe tens of thousands of people who thought of themselves as his friend. He gave his friendship willingly and with a spirit of generosity. Those of us who knew him are saddened by his passing and the political world is a whole lot emptier because he's gone. When Jack entered a room he filled it with an energy and fervor and his presence was felt big-time. Every conversation with him became a debate, even if you agreed with him on an issue. Jack Kemp had no casual thoughts. I knew Jack for nearly 40 years. He was one of my early heroes. To this day I think of myself as a Reagan-Kemp Republican. We both were Californians who came out of blue-collar working-class roots. His father was a truck driver, my father a shipyard worker. We both wanted to remake the Republican Party into a party for working people where hard work was rewarded and opportunities were offered to every man and woman regardless of background, color, religion or beliefs. Jack went from a 13-year all-star career as the starting quarterback with the Buffalo Bills straight to Congress. He was first elected in 1970 and over the next four decades he was one of the most influential and popular men in the Republican Party. He was a true intellectual, a vociferous reader and was a warrior for his ideas. He took the intensity that made him the AFL's most valuable player directly to the halls of Congress without missing a beat. In his 18 years in Congress he was a leader of the new breed of conservatives. After he ran for president in 1988, he was appointed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by President George H.W. Bush. In 1996, he was the Republican vice presidential nominee running with Sen. Bob Dole's presidential effort . Along the way he was an extraordinary husband for 50 years to his wonderful Joanne and a remarkable father to his two sons, Jeff and Jimmy, and his two daughters, Jennifer and Judith, who provided him 17 grandchildren. I was the national chairman of Jack's presidential campaign in 1988. I believed he was the rightful heir to Ronald Reagan and that his conservative principles and ideas would continue to build on the foundation that President Reagan had established. Many of us thought Jack or Sen. Paul Laxalt, Reagan's closest friend and campaign chairman, should have been the vice presidential candidate in 1980. If either of them had been selected, he likely would have been the future president and there would not have been a Bush dynasty. They were the favorites of the convention delegates and President Reagan's top choices, too. He was argued out of them because people said you couldn't have a movie star running with a football star -- or two former governors from neighboring states (California and Nevada). Be that as it may. Jack's contributions to Ronald Reagan's legacy as the tax-cutting guru and unstoppable missionary of supply side economics made much of President Reagan's domestic policy possible. Even though he had always been a quarterback, he became a blocking back for President Reagan in moving his legislation through Congress. Shortly after he became HUD secretary in 1989, several National Football League team owners came to him offering him the job of National Football League Commissioner to replace his long time friend Pete Rozelle. He told me it was the one job he always wanted. My counsel was to take it. He called me back several days later and said he couldn't, because he felt he owed it to President Bush not to walk away after so short a time and that he so wanted to help all those in the urban communities who needed help. Jack was the Republican party's greatest advocate of a ""big tent theory"" and felt the party of Lincoln needed to do more to broaden civil rights and encourage minority participation. He often said he played and showered with more African-Americans then most Republicans meet in a lifetime. They were his friends, and in sports you learn all men bleed the same color. He often repeated the line: ""I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do."" And just as he led his Bills to back to back championships, he drove his party to an ideology that led to the Republican Congressional majorities in the '90s. Like all of us, Jack wasn't perfect, but he was darn good. As someone who tried to manage him, I found that he wasn't manageable. I once told him: ""Jack, if I could remove half your knowledge and three-quarters of your vocabulary, I could make you into a decent candidate."" He laughed and went on his merry way. And of course it was that incredible intellect and his passion for words as well as people that made him such a powerful force. Jack Kemp was the indefatigable happy warrior, who over the last four decades drove his party with an intellectual fervor that influenced every leader from President Reagan to Speaker Newt Gingrich. He fought for his ideas with an intensity like that of very few men I have known. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.",0.6170081,7035

Blind from birth, Wonder's music has always reflected his concern with humanitarian and social issues. On Thursday, he joined the prestigious list of U.N. Messengers of Peace and will focus on the battle for disabled rights. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced the appointment, calling Wonder a ""musical genius"" and ""great humanitarian, who has campaigned against apartheid, for children in need, and for persons with disabilities."" Speaking about his new U.N. role Wonder told CNN's Becky Anderson: ""It's about that ten percent of the world that suffers with a disability. It's about sounding that alarm off that says to the 90 percent: it's time to get it together for those of us with disabilities."" Asked by Anderson what phrase which would encapsulate his mission Wonder said: ""We can never let our fears put our dreams to sleep."" He said the 90 percent of people who aren't disabled should learn not to fear disability, whatever form it takes and called for a stop to an ""ignorance to the highest point of ridiculousness."" Wonder hopes that politicians will listen to him in his new role as a U.N. messenger. ""If you love my music that much, then care about those ten percent as well. There are 650 million disabled people in the world. Lets do something about that. Lets make a change,"" he said. The popularity of Wonder's music at the White House is well known. Indeed, President Obama says he owes a lot to his music. When awarding Wonder the U.S.'s highest award for pop music: the Library of Congress' Gershwin prize earlier this year the president said: ""Michelle might not have dated me, we might not have married. The fact that we agreed on Stevie was the essence of our courtship."" Wonder isn't surprised to see a black man in the White House. ""That whole place of feeling that you can't have a black president or a female president, it's always been about people's inability to think out of the box that's always been backward in the first place."" The only downside from Wonder's new role is for his fans. His new album ""Gospel Inspired By Lula"" wont be coming out until next May he told Anderson. He admitted that after all these years in the business he still gets nervous and still hits the odd bum note. ""We did a show recently where my voice cracked and I said 'we gotta do that again!' We all laughed about it."" Does he have a favorite song from his own catalogue? ""I always use this thing that Duke Ellington would say. He used to say that 'I haven't written it yet.'

Officially, he's The New York Times'  foreign affairs columnist -- a position he's held since 1995 -- as well as the author of five books. Through his syndicated column his opinion has become a recognizable American voice on the international stage, and with it has come a sense of responsibility. ""I agonize over every column. Precisely because I know it is going to be read by a lot of people and it's going to be in Google forever,"" he told CNN. ""So there is that sense of responsibility, but at the same time you do have to take the attitude of 'This is what I think. This is why I think it.' I'm not in a popularity contest."" Before his current position, Friedman served in various posts at the New York Times, including chief economic correspondent, chief White House correspondent and bureau chief in Beirut and Israel. His reporting from Lebanon in 1983 and work in Israel in 1988 won him Pulitzer Prizes for international reporting. Taking in the world provides never-ending fascination, he says. ""I have the best job in the world, I mean, somebody has to have it."" He's recently trained his eye on how America can reassert itself by leading the way in green technology, encapsulated in his latest book ""Hot, flat and crowded."" As he admits, the environmental aspect is not the point of the book; really it's a treatise on how America ""lost its groove and why we need to get it back by taking the lead in the energy revolution."" One man who will need to take a pivotal role is the incoming U.S. president, Barack Obama, Friedman says. ""I have a lot of high hopes for him. I think we are very lucky to have someone with his raw material as the next president. I think he brings together several things that we haven't had,"" Friedman told CNN. Whether Obama can solve the raft of problems he faces is another matter. ""Is he ready to be as radical as the moment? Really have the courage of our crisis? At the end of the day it's gonna be Barack Obama and (Chinese President) Hu Jintao. We're not going to get out of this without cooperating and working closely with China,"" Friedman said. While presenting a view from the United States, Friedman is still able to do a mea culpa on America's behalf when it comes to the current economic crisis. ""We were in the middle of a huge credit bubble which in its own way was a Ponzi scheme. We gave the world financial SARs. We just spread it around the world."" An optimist by nature -- ""I do live by the motto that pessimists are usually right, but all the great change in history was done by optimists"" -- he's sanguine when it comes to the planet in the current climate of economic depression and environmental urgency. ""What I'm basically arguing is that you can look at the world today that is hot, flat, and crowded and you can have one of two reactions. One reaction is to say 'We're cooked, let's party,'"" he said. ""That's not the way I'd look at it. I'd look at it the way John Gardner, the founder of Common Cause, once described. I look at these problems that come from hot, flat and crowded and what I see are incredible opportunities masquerading as insoluble problems.""",0.6137975,4514
175,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Gertrude Baines, the world's oldest person, has died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 115, according to the home where she lived and Guinness World Records said Saturday.

Gertrude Baines passed away at the Western Convalescent Hospital at 7:25 a.m. (10:25 a.m. ET) Friday, Guinness World Records said. Born in 1894, Baines became the world's oldest person in January after the death of another 115-year-old, Maria de Jesus, from Portugal, Guinness World Records said. At her 115th birthday party in April, Baines shook her head in disbelief when presented with the certificate saying she was now in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest person. ""She told me that she owes her longevity to the Lord, that she never did drink, never did smoke, and she never did fool around,"" her doctor, Dr. Charles Witt, said in April.

Last November, she became the oldest African-American to vote for President Obama and received a letter from him on her 115th birthday, Guinness World Records said. Witt said Baines planned to vote for Obama again in 2012. Asked why she voted for Obama, Baines said it was because ""he's for the colored people,"" according to footage from The Los Angeles Times. She said she never thought a black man could become president. ""Everybody's glad for a colored man to be in there sometime,"" Baines said. ""We all are the same on the skin.

Bush, played a role in the decision to invade Iraq. Kiran Chetry: We had a chance to see the screening of this movie and I want to ask you a little bit about the timing. This is coming out three weeks before our 2008 presidential election. Why did you want to it come out now? Oliver Stone: Those events are beyond my control. We made the movie as fast as we could starting last May. If I couldn't have completed it, it would have come out in January perhaps for the inauguration. It's not about this election. It's about the last eight years with one man, George W. Bush. It's his story, how he became the man that he is, how we elected him -- basically, if you start to think about it, where we are now as a country.  Watch Stone discuss why he finds Bush ""fascinating"" » . Chetry: Is it an anti-war movie? Stone: Of course it's an anti-war movie, because I happen to be an anti-war person. That's not to say I'm a pacifist. I believe you fight for the right reasons. This man has us in three wars right now -- Iraq, Afghanistan, and basically, the war on terror. We have a foreign policy which is a very preventive one, a pre-emptive one. It's a Bush doctrine. It's a very dangerous place. Whoever wins the election, Obama or McCain, I think is going to live in the shadow of the events of these last eight years. This man ... will be around, his influence will be felt for 20 years, 40 years. Chetry: What did you want viewers of your movie to come away with? Stone: ... I can't control that. We made the movie to make people think, to make themselves feel, to walk in the shoes of George Bush and to understand him. This is not a job done with malice. This is a fair portrait of the man. I think it's empathetic. You care for him and your feelings for him. An activist said, ""I never thought I could feel something for George Bush. I came out of this movie feeling compassionate for him, and even more important, feeling compassion for our country and where we are now."" Chetry: You had trouble getting financing because people felt it was too, I guess, sympathetic for the president. Stone: Not for that reason. No, I think that the issues that we had with the American corporations were essentially that it was an inconvenient subject. They thought, he's gone from office, and they don't want to know, and he's controversial, and blah, blah, blah. These are corporations -- large corporations. They're not going to take risks like this. So, the movie business you've got to make movies with risks, and unfortunately, America's moving away from that in all forms, not just movies. Chetry: It's very interesting. You had a soliloquy, a great monologue, by the character playing Vice President Dick Cheney ... about the rationale for Iraq. It was very detailed and it's safe to say you didn't have Dick Cheney's cooperation. Where did you compile some of these scenes, some of these dialogues from those scenes? Stone: [Writer] Stanley Weiser and myself did a lot of research. There's not much known about the first [George W.] Bush administration, the first few years. It's coming out gradually from [""Price of Loyalty"" author Ron] Suskind and [""The Bush Tragedy"" author Jacob] Weisburg, and it's coming out gradually. We're finding out about oil and the secret meeting. It is supposition. There are geopolitics involved. There are other issues at stake. We're trying to do justice. We allowed Cheney to speak for himself and [former Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld to speak for himself. And [former Secretary of State Colin] Powell, by the way, is the guy that argues with Cheney in that scene. iReport.com: Will you see 'W.'? Chetry: You say President Bush changed the world. Is it something you believe is permanent? Stone: Put it this way: We have practically an $800 billion Pentagon budget every year. That's a huge amount -- the amount of the bailout right there. Are we going to be in a state of reaction in force for everything that happens? Is it an us-versus-them foreign policy? Of course, I'm very concerned about the Constitution and about the stripping of liberties, torture, Guantanamo. Do you want the whole list? This guy ... he's a disgrace, frankly. And his legacy is going to be a hard one to live down. But I hope we take steps in the positive direction. And I am an optimist. Chetry: Variety's review said Oliver Stone's ""W."" feels like a rough draft, that it may behoove to make in 10 or 15 years. They say it lacks an ending because we don't have time as perspective. Did we need some more time? Stone: I think the film is quite satisfying in that it shows you the marks for Iraq. It ends at the moment he goes to war. We know how things turn out. It's not a film about those eight years. It's a film about the character of a man. There's a first act when he's in his 20s, a second act in his 40s and the third act when he's in his mid-50s. It's a character study and we get to the place at which we know the way he's going to behave. It's a father-son story because a lot of his actions are motivated by, let's call it, rivalry to be stronger than his father. And that's part of the reason he goes to Iraq.",0.6114167,1076
177,"(CNN) -- What can 40 goats and 20 cows buy a Kenyan man? Chelsea Clinton's love, if you ask Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor. Hillary Clinton says she would let her daughter Chelsea know about a Kenyan man's unique marriage offer. The Kenyan man first offered the dowry nine years ago to then-President Bill Clinton in asking for the hand of his only child. He renewed it Thursday after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked about the proposal at a Nairobi town hall session. CNN's Fareed Zakaria, the session's moderator, commented that given the economic crisis at hand, Chepkurgor's dowry was ""not a bad offer."" However, Clinton said her daughter was her own person. ""She's very independent,"" she said. ""So I will convey this very kind offer.""  Watch Clinton's response to dowry offer » . The audience laughed, but Clinton's comments were no joke to Chepkurgor, who described the younger Clinton as a ""beautiful, disciplined and well-natured woman."" ""Of course I have never met her, but I like her family and how they stick together,"" Chepkurgor told CNN. ""I've waited for a long time. I'm still waiting to meet her and express my love for her."" Chepkurgor operates a small electronics and computer shop in Nakuru, a major city northwest of Nairobi. He may still be waiting for Chelsea, but he's not exactly single. He married his wife Grace, a college classmate, in 2006. ""My wife has no problem with this,"" he insisted. ""She listened to the answers given by Hillary and did not complain."" Polygamy is legal in Kenya, so Chelsea would be Chepkurgor's second wife. ""Is that allowed in your side of the world?"" he laughed. In Kenya, a man proposes with dowry for the prospective bride, Chepkurgor explained. He said he stands by his initial livestock offer until someone makes a counteroffer. Chepkurgor, now 39, first made his intentions known when all three Clintons visited East Africa in 2000. He wrote a letter to the former president, offering himself as his only child's suitor. He said he had not expected the secretary of state to address the issue during her visit to Kenya this week. However, he admits his chances might be rather slim. ""Unfortunately, I don't have their contact information,"" he said. ""I just want to convey my message of goodwill to the Clintons,"" he said. ""And to all of America.""",0.6094936,7609
178,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One can only imagine the sights this hat has seen. Perched atop a man who towered over his peers at 6 foot 4 inches, this hat must have had quite a view. ""Abraham Lincoln: An Extraordinary Life"" will be on display through January 2011. It may have been there when a divided nation -- a devastating Civil War on the horizon -- elected a politician from Illinois as president. It could have watched as this president, so desperate to preserve the Union, carefully drafted the Emancipation Proclamation, thus changing the course of American history. And we know for sure that this hat was witness to a tragic April night when the same president was fatally shot while enjoying a play. The iconic top hat, part of a collection of items associated with Abraham Lincoln, is now on display at the National Museum of American History. Nearly three years in the making, ""Abraham Lincoln: An Extraordinary Life"" is part of the Smithsonian Institution's bicentennial celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth and a rare glimpse into the life of one of our nation's greatest presidents. Nearly two centuries later, still adorned with a black band of mourning for a son who died too early, Lincoln's hat is worn-down, yet strangely magnificent. Maybe it is the hat's history that gives it such a majestic quality. Or perhaps it is simply that a top hat always commands a certain reverence -- an attribute that may reveal a great deal about the vanity of its owner. ""Why would somebody who is 6 foot 4 inches decide to wear a tall hat?"" asks Harry Rubenstein, curator of the exhibit. ""He clearly has this desire to stand out in the crowd, to make his place in it."" Rubenstein hopes this is the type of intimate detail about our 16th president's life that people will take away from the ongoing Lincoln exhibit. ""This is the first time we've brought together all of the museum's best Lincoln objects to tell the story of Lincoln's life,"" Rubenstein says. ""And I think it's a different kind of story that emerges -- one that's more intimate and more personal and one that brings this story to life in very tangible ways.""  Watch descriptions of items in the Lincoln exhibit » . The Smithsonian Institution started its Lincoln collection more than 140 years ago, Rubenstein says. The exhibit, which opened in January, houses more than 60 items from Abraham Lincoln's life, spanning his humble beginnings, his political career, his life in the White House, and even relics recovered in the wake of his assassination. Rubenstein says the collection includes ""little personal objects of things he touched and used at pivotal moments in his life,"" like his office suit, his gold pocket watch -- and a coffee cup he left on a windowsill the night of his assassination. The exhibit is also home to more significant objects, such as the inkstand Lincoln used to draft the Emancipation Proclamation, and a patent model of a device he invented for lifting boats over sand bars.  See photos from the exhibit » . Also on display is memorabilia from the 1860 presidential election campaign -- such as a replica poster portraying a young and masculine Lincoln splitting rail -- that reveal a candidate not impervious to the somewhat superficial aspects of the American political system. Rubenstein says that although Lincoln scoffed at his party's attempts to brand him as ""Old Abe the Rail Splitter,"" he understood the importance of appealing to the masses and creating an image to ""link him and his ideals in an iconic kind of way."" Perhaps no one is more aware of the power of Lincoln's iconic image than President Barack Obama, who frequently cited his Illinois predecessor as a source of inspiration for his own presidency. While Rubenstein warns against drawing too much of a comparison between presidents -- the two Illinoisans have been linked by their reformist platforms, their penchant for eloquent speeches, and even for their physical likenesses -- he acknowledges the significance of the symbolic timing: As the first African-American becomes president, the nation celebrates the 200th birthday of the man who ended slavery. ""We have a president from Illinois -- the land of Lincoln -- who has found inspiration in the Lincoln story. ... It's clearly an historic moment,"" Rubenstein says. Nonetheless, as the nation celebrates Obama's momentous election, ""An Extraordinary Life"" is a reminder of the relevance of Lincoln's legacy today and commemorates the incredible life that he led. ""It is amazing ...here is this individual from a family in the middle of the woods in Kentucky ... [struggling] to educate himself,"" Rubenstein says. ""To then take on this incredible responsibility, [and] beyond that, his ability to articulate those ideas to inspire not only his generation, but for us today ... it's an extraordinary odyssey that he took."" Visit ""Abraham Lincoln: An Extraordinary Life"" at the National Museum of American History on the National Mall, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., in Washington, D.C. The exhibit runs through January 2011. For more information, or to view the online exhibit, visit the museum's Web site.",0.6081866,2911
179,"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as president January 20, there will be music -- by, among others, Aretha Franklin, Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman and the U.S. Marine Band. There will be prayers and speeches -- including Obama's inaugural address. And for the fourth time in the nation's 56 inauguration ceremonies, there will be poetry -- by someone far less well-known. Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle. After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion. Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama's. She joins three other poets who have read at inaugural ceremonies -- Robert Frost in 1961 for John F. Kennedy's inauguration and Maya Angelou and Miller Williams, who read at Bill Clinton's 1993 and 1997 inaugurations. Alexander has written five books of poetry, including ""American Sublime,"" a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005. Her father is Clifford Alexander, secretary of the Army in the Carter administration, and her mother teaches history at George Washington University. Her brother is an adviser to Obama's transition team. Alexander's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from ""American Sublime"" (Graywolf Press): . Poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner, . overhear on the bus, God / in the details, the only way . to get from here to there. / Poetry (and now my voice is rising) is not all love, love, love, / and I'm sorry the dog died. Poetry (here I hear myself loudest) / is the human voice, . and are we not of interest to each other? Alexander spoke Friday to CNN.com. CNN: What do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this? Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle. CNN: You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago? Alexander: In the community in Hyde Park, he and Mrs. Obama were just people I'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about, and we were of a generation. ... He was in the law school, and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work didn't really cross so much. ... [We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community. CNN: And you did it by writing? Alexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years. CNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you? Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, ""Isn't that something?"" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, ""I never thought I'd live to see this day."" The fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us. CNN: What's ahead of us? Alexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ... The larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better. CNN: Can poetry help in that regard? Alexander: I do believe that it can. The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful, because after all if we can't be precise with language, how can we share ideas? Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions. You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem, but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it, those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems. CNN: So you're going to write a poem about health care? Alexander: That would be fun. Of course, this [poem for the inauguration] is an occasional poem, it has to serve the moment, it has to serve the day, right? So those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day. But of course, what I hope to do, rather than the laundry list poem, is to find language that will hopefully have a little resonance after the day is done. CNN: Will you show it to anybody before you read it? Alexander: I show it to my husband [artist Ficre Ghebreyesus] , and he is my first, last and best critic. CNN: You wrote an essay about Gwendolyn Brooks [the Pulitzer Prize-winning African-American poet] in which you said that ""the pressure on creative work can be intense for artists who belong to groups still struggling for their fair shake in society."" And then later on you said you've seen your work ""overpraised by narrow-minded white critics"" and ""criticized small-mindedly by more than one black woman elder poet -- the same poets I imagined would be pleased by it."" Your work is read very differently depending on who's reading it? Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received. ... On the one hand, I have devoted much of my work to African-American culture. That's my group, that's who I am, [I'm] proud and unambiguous about that -- but at the same time, one of the really great discoveries of a life in poetry has been that poetry is quirky. It reaches people unexpectedly. You really, really can't predict who is going to connect with various aspects of your work. That's been a real gift to me; it's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work. CNN: You have two children? Alexander: Two sons, 9 and 10. CNN: How do they feel about the poem? Alexander: They are so excited, and that's of course a lovely thing. And in the excitement, we still live in our every day, so mommy is still mommy, and all the mommy things are expected of me, and that's the way I like it. CNN: What are your tastes in music? Alexander: Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most, and I mean jazz across the board because that's an incredibly diverse art, and also I must say, R&B, funk and soul speak very powerfully to me. CNN: Favorite artists? Alexander: Thelonious Monk is quite a favorite artist. Marvin Gaye, John Coltrane, and also the breadth and accomplishment over a career of Duke Ellington. CNN: And Aretha Franklin? Alexander: Can you imagine? I get to hear her at close range. Boy, that's going to be my gift for the year.",0.6080628,7165
180,"(CNN) --   On Friday afternoon, Robin Meade, HLN anchor of ""Morning Express with Robin Meade,"" sky-dived just before former President George Herbert Walker Bush, who was commemorating his 85th birthday. HLN Anchor Robin Meade chats with former president George H.W. Bush on his 85th birthday. In recent years, Bush's jumps have been about fun and celebration, but he first parachuted out of a plane when he was a naval aviator shot down over the Pacific Ocean during World War II. On Friday, Meade and Bush were each strapped to a member of the Army's Golden Knights parachute team. They made their jumps over Kennebunkport, Maine. Before the jumps, Meade sat down with Bush to learn more about why he sky-dives. Plus, the former president weighed in on his and his son's legacies, Supreme Court justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor, and his view on the country's most pressing problems. This is an edited transcript of the interview. Robin Meade: Thank you for making time for us to talk to you today. George H.W. Bush: Oh, no, listen, I'm so glad you're here. Meade: Happy birthday -- 85. Bush: I thought you didn't know. Meade: Everybody knows, right? Bush: I know. It's exciting. It really is wonderful. Meade: What's with your penchant for jumping still? Bush: Well, two reasons. One, it still feels good. You still get a charge out of it. Not easy to do at 85, but ... Meade: I don't think it's easy to do at any age.  Watch Bush talk about why he still sky-dives » . Bush: And secondly, just because you're old, that doesn't mean you can't do fun stuff. And you don't want to sit around drooling in the corner. And so it's a wonderful release. And you know, because I was president, it sends a message all around. You can go out and get something going. Old guys can still have fun and still do stuff. And so, those are the two reasons. ... Meade: You know, I'm thinking about, too, last Saturday we had the 65th anniversary of D-Day, and that was the first time, in World War II, that you jumped, because you had to ditch your plane. Bush: Yes. Meade: Being back with service members up in a plane and getting ready to jump, does that kind of rekindle your feelings of connection? Bush: A little bit of deja vu. A little bit, but not that much anymore. But yes, that's one of the reasons I made the first controlled jump, is because I did the first jump -- or had to get out of the plane. And that was kind of ugly. I pulled the ripcord too early and hit my head on the tail of the plane going by. I was just lucky I'm still alive. And the parachute hung up for a minute on the tail of the plane. It's all kind of war stories. If I start telling you that, then you'll tell me about your father's war stories or something, or grandfather's. And so it wouldn't be fair. But I wanted to do it right. And I did it wrong then. It did save my life, but I did it wrong. So then I've been out with the Golden Knights and I made several solo jumps. And now it's tandem. I think they hope the old boy will remember to push. Meade: Did I read somewhere that you asked President Clinton to jump once? And he hasn't jumped with you. Bush: I may have asked him. I can't remember. Maybe I did, but I have a good relationship with him, a very good one.  Watch Bush leave plane, land » . Meade: Now that you're 85, are you thinking a little bit more about the ""L"" word, ""legacy?"" Bush: I was thinking of the ""L"" word being ""life."" Life its own self. But no, I think my view on legacy is let the historians figure out what I screwed up and figure out what I got right. And I'm confident that, you know, we had a good administration and good people. And I think the same thing is true of our son. And you know, he had tough times and all, but he's doing it right. He's laying back there and he's not criticizing the president. And I'm very proud of him.  Watch Bush and sons talk after the jump » . And I hope that we both have set examples for how you ought to conduct yourself when you've been president and then go out of office. Let the other guy do it, and support him when you can, and be silent. Don't be out there criticizing all the time. Meade: The one guy at the helm? Bush: Yes. And the ""L"" word, so it doesn't -- I mean, my view is the historians will decide these things, for better or for worse and for right or for wrong. So I'm not doing any biography or anything like that. And I'm confident, because we had such a great team around us, that it will be favorable. Meade: Tell me a little bit about Judge Sonia Sotomayor, she's someone that you appointed to a U.S. District Court. Bush: District Court. Meade: Now she's been nominated for the Supreme Court. What would her impact be on the Supreme Court, do you think? Bush: I think she'd pull a ripcord just at the right time and make a very nice parachutist. I'm going to leave that to others to analyze, but she should be given a fair hearing. She should be accorded every courtesy that goes with her record as a judge and her aspirations to be a Supreme Court justice. And I have a feeling she will be confirmed, but again, I don't go into that day in and day out. ... I think she's had a distinguished record on the bench and she should be entitled to fair hearings.  I like the way Sen. John Cornyn said it. I mean, he may vote for her, he may not. But he's been backing away from these -- backing off from those who use radical statements to describe her or to attribute things to her that may or may not be true. I mean, she was called by somebody a ""racist."" Well, that's not right. I mean, it's not fair. It doesn't help the process to be out there name-calling. So let them decide whether they want to vote for her or not, and get on with it. Meade: There are so many causes and so many problems, so many issues right now. Bush: Right. Right. Meade: What is our most pressing problem, do you think, in the country? Bush: Well, I'd have to say as long as people are hurting, the economy, and those who are out of work, can't find work. I think it will get better. I remain optimistic about our recovery and all of that. But I'd say that's -- and health care. But those -- we've got a lot of people working on those problems. Meade: Oh, by the way, one more question. Is there going to be another jump after this? Bush: I think when I finish this one, I'll say, ""See you on my 90th."" Whether I do it or not, it gives me a goal. I'm a goal-oriented guy. I really believe in goals. And so -- but we finish this one ... Meade: I hope we do. Bush: ... we'll all be standing there. And they'll say to you, ""What are you going to do?"" And you'll say, ""Five more years, I'm going to do another one."" And I'll say, ""I'll be there."" Ninety years old. I'll do it. Meade: Is it a deal? In five years, we'll do it again? Bush: I'm for it. I'm for it. Meade: OK. All right.",0.60306823,4790
181,"(CNN)  -- Two former presidents reflected on their greatest regrets in office Monday, each looking back to issues that continue to plague the nation years later. Former presidents and political rivals Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush now share philanthropic efforts. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton appeared together at a question-and-answer forum before the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans, Louisiana. Asked his biggest regret after leaving office, Bush said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get Saddam Hussein to leave office at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. He told the gathering, ""I've thought a lot about it, but at the end of Desert Storm, the question was should we have kind of kept going on that road to death and all this slaughter until Saddam Hussein showed up and laid his sword on the table, surrendered. And the common wisdom was he wouldn't do that."" But he said a conversation with an FBI agent who interrogated Saddam after he was captured has made him reconsider. Bush recalled their talk, ""I said, 'What if we just say he has to come to surrender, would he have done it?' And this guy said, 'I'm absolutely convinced he would have.' My experts tell me he wouldn't have."" Bush said, ""We ended it the way we said we would"" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending ""would have been perfect."" He added, ""If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him."" On a day that President Barack Obama dispatched George Mitchell to the Middle East as the latest U.S. envoy, Clinton discussed the failure to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians. ""My No. 1 regret is that I was not able to persuade Yasser Arafat to accept the peace plan I offered at the end of my presidency that the Israelis accepted. ""If he had done that ... we had had seven years of progress toward peace. We had one year in 1998, the only year in the history of Israel where not a single soul was killed in a terrorist act. The Palestinians had more control over West Bank then than they do today,"" Clinton said. ""And if he had taken that deal, we would have a Palestinian state and we would have had, I think now, normal peaceful relations with Israel and all of its Arab neighbors."" Clinton said a deal would have helped the U.S. handle other issues in the region, saying, ""We'd be much better positioned to deal with the problem of Iran, and we would have taken away about half the arguments of terrorists around the world by giving the Palestinians their state and creating a cooperative, positive interdependence in the Middle East, not a negative one. And so, I think that would have done more good to save more lives and help more people, and I wish I had been able to do that. "" Clinton also said he regretted not doing more to ""stop the Rwandan genocide,"" and succeeding on a new health care plan. He said ""presidents should share freely ... the mistakes they made"" with historians, because it teaches lessons. He said he shared problems during the lunch with Obama and the four living presidents, saying, ""You want each new president to make new mistakes, not the same ones."" Clinton added, ""all of us know if you make enough decisions, you're going to make a few of them aren't right.""",0.60289097,3322
183,"Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday. If you're passionate about the topic, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says the three presidential candidates will never be ""regular folks."" (CNN) -- Can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an ""average American"" will occupy the White House? Listening to the punditry today, you would think folks who revel in the comedy of Larry the Cable Guy or Katt Williams really would have a shot at the White House. It's totally absurd. So, Sen. Barack Obama is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to Columbia and Harvard? And Sen. Hillary Clinton is an elitist because she went to Yale? Do you actually think Sen. John McCain isn't an elitist? He went to an exclusive college -- the Naval Academy, and that is one of the hardest places to get into. (You can't even apply unless a member of Congress recommends you.) Karl Rove, who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich Republican, has called both Democratic candidates elitists. Well, his former boss, President George W. Bush, went to Yale. So did Bush's dad, former president George H.W. Bush, and his granddaddy, former Sen. Prescott Bush. All three Bushes also were members of the super elite organization Skull and Bones. The younger Bush later went to Harvard. He walked into the governor's mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dad's money and connections. Sounds like an elitist to me! But no, we're supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots, folksy charm and him removing brush at his Crawford, Texas, ranch (don't forget the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where all the ""regular"" folks hang out). Surely you recall when Bush nominated Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court? Those same conservative voices decrying the elitist Democrats were blasting her because she went to little old Southern Methodist University, that unremarkable -- their view -- university in Dallas, Texas. (By the way, that will be the home of the George W. Bush Library.) You can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from Harvard, Yale or Princeton, she wouldn't have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the Republican Party. And let's stay with the Supreme Court for a moment. Where did its members go to school? Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. -- Undergrad and law school, Harvard. Justice John Paul Stevens -- Undergrad: University of Chicago. Law school: Northwestern. Justice Antonin Scalia -- Undergrad: Georgetown University and the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. Law school: Harvard. Justice Anthony Kennedy -- Undergrad: Stanford University and the London School of Economics. Law school: Harvard. Justice David Souter -- Undergrad: Harvard; Magdalen College, Oxford; Oxford University. Law school: Harvard. Justice Clarence Thomas -- Undergrad: Holy Cross. Law school: Yale. Justice Ruth Ginsburg -- Undergrad: Cornell. Law school: Harvard (attended); finished at Columbia. Justice Stephen Breyer -- Undergrad, Stanford; Magdalen College, Oxford. Law school: Harvard. Justice Samuel Alito -- Undegrad: Princeton. Law school: Yale. That's pretty much an elite list of schools. We have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the White House is really and truly like the rest of us. All three candidates don't know what it's like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of Americans are confronted with daily. Each are members of the U.S. Senate, and they have the best health care money can buy for life -- we pay for it! While your pension plan is shot to hell, their plan will NEVER be underfunded. The members will see to that, courtesy of taxpayer dollars. Forget how many times Obama bowls gutter balls, Clinton tosses back shots of whiskey and McCain talks about how he's a regular guy. Each, courtesy of their $169,300 annual salary, makes far more than the average American. And when it comes to wealth, Clinton gets to enjoy the $100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the White House (even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors). McCain's wife, Cindy, runs one of Anheuser Busch's largest beer distributors and is worth more than $100 million. They will never be living paycheck-to-paycheck. Obama is the poorest of the three, but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his best-selling books, ""The Audacity of Hope"" and ""Dreams from My Father"" after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. How many average Americans wouldn't mind having a million dollars in their savings account? Bottom line: The narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day. And their efforts to show that they are ""just like us"" are really pathetic. You don't have to go duck hunting, be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that you're ""one of us."" Just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics: Advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home. One more thing: Don't buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television, radio and in print who decry these ""elitists"" and trumpet that they are for the blue collar, middle-class worker in middle America. Many of them pull down multimillion-dollar salaries and run into these same candidates on Martha's Vineyard and in the Hamptons when they all vacation. They, too, will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh private schools and Ivy League institutions. Yes, we even have elitists in the media. Who would've thunkit?

184,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Director Barry Levinson is the star of his new film. Well, almost. Director Barry Levinson sizes up politics and media in his new film, ""PoliWood."" In the Academy Award-winning filmmaker's new documentary ""PoliWood,"" Levinson takes a look at the world of policymakers and screen actors and ends up voicing his own ideas in the process. ""The fact that my voice is in it always scares me to death, because I never like to be on camera, period,"" Levinson said. (The ""Rain Man"" director has appeared in a handful of films, notably the Robert Redford-directed ""Quiz Show."") In ""PoliWood,"" Levinson follows a group of politically active actors to the Democratic and Republican conventions as they take in the theater of it all. The journey leads to President Obama's inauguration. ""PoliWood"" also explores the idea that the media have become confusing catalysts that blur the lines of reality and myth. Television, which was once a romanticized invention that brought entertainment and public service announcements into our homes, is now a portal for manipulating what we see, feel and think, in the film's presentation. CNN talked to Levinson about the politics of the media, Hollywood actors supporting candidates and ""PoliWood."" CNN: Tell me about the celebrity-politician-media link. Barry Levinson: Well, I think what happened is, you have this television screen, and everything has to go through that screen -- and at a certain point, I don't think that we can tell the difference between the celebrity and the politician. They both have to entertain us in some fashion. That's why I think, in second half of the 20th century, you saw this kind of change where John F. Kennedy was probably the first television politician. He came across, he was good-looking, he was great in the way he spoke; he had a certain sense of humor. Then you had Reagan. Someone looked at him giving a speech for Goldwater and said, you know, he could be a politician. Two years after that, he became governor of California. So anyone that is pleasant enough on television suddenly gets credentials, whether they have earned it or not. And there's that blurring of it between celebrity and politics and everything else. CNN: Do you think that most celebrities have a good understanding of the politicians they support, or do some just jump on the bandwagon? Levinson: I think ""PoliWood"" shows it in some ways and talks about it. But basically, to be honest, there is no upside for any actor to be politically involved other than the fact that they are concerned citizens. It doesn't benefit their career at all. The term ""celebrity"" is sort of a bogus term, though, in a lot of ways. CNN: Why? Levinson: Well because Paris Hilton and Susan Sarandon, they're both celebrities, but Paris Hilton hasn't ever really done anything, in a way. Susan Sarandon has been an actress whose done a lot of different roles, been around a long time, has been politically active, extremely smart and knowledgeable about that. But there's two women, they get exposure, but there's a huge difference between that. Some have earned it; some get that attention just by the way they look or the way they have carried on in public. CNN: There's a scene in ""PoliWood"" where actors sit down with regular people, and they talk about relating to one another. Levinson: Well, how is that so-called celebrities -- how would they possibly relate to the ordinary person? But 90 percent of them come from those families -- they come out of the Midwest or the South or the Northeast. They come out of working-class families primarily. And because of the nature of America, that if you have certain dreams, and ultimately those dreams can in fact come true, they benefited by the society that they live in. But their roots come from all these small towns around the country, so of course they can relate. CNN: Do you think the Democratic and Republican conventions are pure theater? Levinson: Oh, absolutely. There's no political content that takes place at a political convention. It used to be that they would hammer out a platform. You know, there's all kind of back-room meetings, so now it's a show. It is a show both places. CNN: What do you think of President Obama? Levinson: He obviously is great on TV, and he is extremely smart, and so what we're gonna see as it goes down the road, what changes does he actually bring about? How does he work with Congress? All of those particular issues. He understands TV, and he's a great communicator. Now, will he be good or bad? We'll see what happens in a four-year period from someone who has great capabilities -- where does it all go? It's too early to determine that. CNN: Do you watch much television, or do you have a cynical view about it? Levinson: I try to watch TV like anyone else. I like to tune in just to see what new shows are out there. And then there are certain shows that I just get infuriated over. And then there are so-called political shows that I have a difficult time with. And sometimes I sit, and images are flying by so fast in some of these pieces, I'm going, ""What is that about?"" I've no idea. It looks like a collision of images on the screen.",0.601586,7901
185,"(CNN) -- Rick Perlstein could have called his book ""Paranoia."" Richard Nixon was ""the guy who exploited these tensions to create a new kind of politics,"" says Rick Perlstein. If Perlstein's history of the 1960s and early '70s in America has a throughline, it's mistrust. Parents don't trust their children. Enlisted men don't trust their officers. Blacks don't trust whites, Southerners don't trust Northerners, the Silent Majority doesn't trust the Intellectual Establishment, and -- soon enough -- nobody trusts the government. And in the midst of it all was Richard Nixon: Red-baiter, former vice president, failed gubernatorial nominee, punch line, political strategist and president, a master at playing both sides to maintain his hold on power. In doing so, he provided a roadmap for his successors. Hence Perlstein's actual title: ""Nixonland"" (Scribner). ""I'm fascinated with how Americans fight with each other,"" says Perlstein, 39, who was born the year Nixon took office. ""And the '60s is the best, the most -- besides the Civil War, I can't think of a more dramatic canvas. And Nixon fits in as the guy who exploited these tensions to create a new kind of politics that we're still living with now.""  Slideshow: What made the '60s the '60s » . Perlstein's book has earned rave reviews. In The Atlantic magazine, conservative writer Ross Douthat praised the author for ""the rare gift of being able to weave social, political, and cultural history into a single seamless narrative."" Newsweek's Evan Thomas called it ""the best book written about the 1960s"" in more than a quarter-century. Perlstein says he's long had an obsession with the '60s -- which, in ""Nixonland,"" start with the Democratic landslide of 1964 and end with the Nixon landslide of 1972. The author, now a senior fellow at the left-leaning Campaign for America's Future in Chicago, considers the book a sequel to his earlier work, a biography of Barry Goldwater and the rise of the conservative movement. But ""Nixonland"" is as much a cultural history as a political chronicle; indeed, in the '60s the two were tightly enmeshed. The decade saw the full flower of youth culture, which was intertwined with Vietnam War protests, increasing drug use and distinctive music. It also saw the rise of what Nixon, in a major 1969 speech, termed the ""Silent Majority"" -- older, more conservative Americans buffeted on all sides by change, taking refuge in the familiar. Both groups had their pop culture heroes and touchstones, Perlstein observes. ""The generational divide went so deep as to form a fundamental argument about what was moral and what was immoral,"" Perlstein says. ""This was how people lived in the world -- through popular culture and through politics. The two feed off each other."" Though the era is now remembered through the rosy lenses of the baby boomers, their parents -- the heart of the ""Silent Majority"" -- didn't look upon the culture so fondly. Many disdained the era's pop music, the most obvious expression of youth. Moreover, some of the highest-rated TV specials of 1969 and 1970 were Bob Hope programs, Perlstein writes, and when a movie such as 1970's ""Joe"" came out -- about a hardhat who loathes the hippies -- many in the audience came to cheer for the hardhat. Movies may have been the most revealing mirror of society. The rise of the youth culture coincided with the death of the studio system. Some of what emerged were films willing to show the grit and ugliness of the cities (""the cities"" being a common euphemism for civic decline). ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""The French Connection,"" the Academy Awards' best pictures of 1969 and 1971 respectively, show a weary, cold New York crumbling under its residents' feet. Television tiptoed more gingerly into the new age, Perlstein says. With just three networks catering to the entire country, ""everything had to have this lowest-common-denominator mass appeal,"" he says. ""You could watch TV in 1966 and it's really not any different from what it looked like in 1956. ""When you did get interesting shows, it was often an accident -- a midseason replacement,"" he adds. "" 'The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour' was supposed to be a typical variety show. [CBS] never would have signed it up had they known that they were going to start talking about how much they hated the Vietnam War and started putting on Pete Seeger and making jokes about Richard Nixon. It was an accident."" An underlying theme of ""Nixonland"" is how the various cultural and political movements eventually borrow from each other, with varying results. The mass gatherings of youth -- ""be-in,"" ""sit-in"" -- became ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in,"" a colorful comedy show hosted by two nightclub comics, with a writing staff that included an old Nixon hand, Paul Keyes. The nightly arguments between parents and children became the sitcom ""All in the Family,"" a show whose central figure -- the bigoted construction worker Archie Bunker -- became a cultural hero. And then there was Nixon, a controlling man who, in trying to stay at least one move ahead of everyone else, ends up consumed by his own power. The result is Watergate, which is just being uncovered as ""Nixonland"" ends. Could it have been different? Countless commentators have tried to replay history from the hinge year of 1968, wondering if a surviving Robert Kennedy could have beaten Nixon and salved an angry culture. Perlstein, whose next book will chronicle the '70s, will have none of it. ""I don't like that magic thinking. I'm very suspicious of it,"" he says. ""Martyrs seem to get 100 extra bonus points in the annals of history, and that's a bias. By the same token, nostalgia systematically cheats the past. ""I think that it pulls around to one of the huge themes of my book and my work, which is that we really want to believe that somehow magically we can transcend our differences in American and as Americans without working hard at it. ""If only this person had lived; if only this event hadn't gone the way it did. But the fact of the matter is, we are a deeply divided nation, and transcending those differences isn't the work of an afternoon or a single person. It's something we all have to fight for.""",0.5988368,4362
186,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The power of women hit the State Department on Wednesday when first lady Michelle Obama joined Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to celebrate champions of women's rights around the world. Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton present the State Department Women of Courage Awards. The event was to celebrate the State Department Women of Courage Awards, but highlighted how both the current and former first ladies have made women's rights a signature issue. Since calling women's rights a human rights issue at a women's conference in Beijing in 1995, Clinton has made it a personal mission to champion the rights of women. Her first two trips as secretary of state have been packed with events promoting the importance of women's rights. ""These personal experiences have informed my work, and I will continue to fight for human rights as secretary of state in traditional and especially nontraditional ways and venues,"" Clinton told the audience. You ""can't solve problems of financial crisis, climate change, disease and poverty if half of the population is left behind,"" Clinton said. The rights of women will ""always be central to our foreign policy."" In a commentary published Monday in honor of International Women's Day, Clinton warned that ""women still comprise the majority of the world's poor, unfed and unschooled."" ""Global problems are too big and too complex to be solved without the full participation of women,"" she wrote in the article, which ran in more than 50 newspapers around the world. ""Strengthening women's rights is not only a continuing moral obligation -- it is also a necessity as we face a global economic crisis, the spread of terrorism and nuclear weapons, regional conflicts that threaten families and communities, and climate change and the dangers it presents to the world's health and security."" Ambiga Sreenevasan, a Malaysian lawyer who won an award Wednesday for her work on behalf of justice for women, called Clinton ""a woman of courage who has encouraged woman around the world."" Clinton's speech declaring that women's rights are human rights, Sreenevasan said, has ""resonated with a lot of us here."" Clinton also heaped praise on the current first lady, saying that in a very short time, Michelle Obama ""through her grace and her wisdom [has] become an inspiration to women and girls, not only in the United States, but around the world."" Obama spoke about the importance of proper health care, education and justice for women in ensuring strong families and communities. ""The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is the presence of women who are valued, where relationships among women and between women and men are based upon mutual respect,"" Obama said. Obama said the work done by the honorees has not just changed their own circumstances, but by inspiring hope and motivating others to act, that work also has changed women's lives around the world. ""This is how real change occurs, one determined woman at a time. And change is coming,"" she said. ""The women we honor today teach us three very important lessons. One, that as women, we must stand up for ourselves. The second, as women we must stand up for each other. And finally, as women we must stand up for justice for all."" On Wednesday, President Obama created a White House Council on Women and Girls, charged with devising a coordinated federal response to various challenges faced by American women. The council, which will be led by senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett and which will include most members of the president's Cabinet, will be charged with ensuring that all governmental agencies take the needs of women into account. The president said the council will also help ensure a more coordinated federal response on a range of issues, including equal pay, family leave and child care. He also nominated Melanne Verveer, Clinton's chief of staff when she was first lady, as ambassador-at-large for global women's issues. In addition to Sreenevasan, the Women of Courage honorees make up an impressive list of advocates on behalf of women under difficult and often dangerous circumstances. Hadizatou Mani escaped caste-based slavery in Niger to help fight for rights of other people still enslaved in the country. Veronika Marchenko was honored for her activism on behalf of slain soldiers' families in Russia. Suaad Allami won an award for running a nongovernmental organization on behalf of women in Sadr City, Iraq, that is considered a ""one-stop shop"" for legal, educational and domestic violence counseling for women. Mutabar Tadjibayeva is one of the most vocal activists in Uzbekistan fighting on behalf of women's rights, despite being arrested and beaten by police. In Guatemala, where an average of two women each day die a violent death, Norma Cruz provides support to families of women who are murdered. One honoree, 12-year-old Reem al-Numery of Yemen, was unable to attend because she is in court fighting her forced marriage to a 30-year-old cousin who allegedly raped and beat her. Her battle in the courts to divorce her husband has sparked an avalanche of activism on behalf of Yemeni preteens sold into wedlock.",0.5986715,1971

Syed, a junior at Harvard University majoring in government, is an editorial editor at The Harvard Crimson as well as a senior editor and columnist for the Harvard-MIT journal on Islam and society, Ascent. She is chairwoman of the Harvard Institute of Politics Policy Group on Racial Profiling. Nafees Syed says President Obama's early words and actions send a powerful, positive signal to Muslims. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- President Obama has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for. He reassured Muslims in America that ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers."" For those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward Islam during his campaign, this signaled a welcome change. Even more important was his subsequent statement: ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" In traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years, I heard several anti-American comments; these Europeans were challenging me, a Muslim, about American foreign policy in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan. In Muslim countries, I've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America, followed by accusations that, ""your President Bush doesn't like us Muslims."" As a Muslim-American, I have found myself in a difficult position. In America, I've had to explain Islam to other Americans, and abroad, I've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world. Obama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world. For me personally, it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims. And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions. In his first steps as president, Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, as special envoy for the Middle East. For the past few weeks, I've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama's recent actions. Obama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not: Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world. There is a popular saying of the Prophet Mohammed's that the Muslim community is like one body: If one part hurts, the entire body feels the pain. Muslims are very aware of this message and, in the last 20 years, three conflicts have continuously dominated the Muslim consciousness: Chechnya, Kashmir and, most notably, Palestine. Obama recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from Al-Arabiya, indicating he would actively engage Arab media. The Palestinian-Israeli issue dominated the interview, with Obama promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict. To understand the challenge Obama faces in changing America's role in the conflict, one must realize the situation he walked into as president. Muslims around the world were watching the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in a Gaza military campaign conducted with a green light from the Bush administration. Obama is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed. However, Obama's tone of respect and not condescension, a clear break with the past, improves the chances that such a relationship could arise. His interview with Al-Arabiya was filled with reassuring statements that America is ""ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest,"" that ""the language we use has to be a language of respect."" After years of hearing rhetoric of ""a crusade"" and ""Islamofascism"" from the U.S. government, Obama's policy of listening, not dictating, has generated optimism in the Muslim world. I am sure that the Muslim world will respond with goodwill as well. Already, Obama is very well-respected there for his intelligence, eloquence and experience living in the largest Muslim country, Indonesia. Muslims abroad are just as willing as those in America to taste his message of hope and change. To win over the skeptics abroad, Obama will just have to do what he is doing in America: reach out to all sides for solutions and follow up his words with concrete action. In the meantime, the next few weeks will see Muslims around the world taking the hand America is extending after a long hiatus.

188,"(CNN) -- Move over Wonder Woman and Lois Lane - Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin are breaking into the world of comic books. No capes, no tights: Female Force stars Sarah Palin, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Caroline Kennedy. Washington-based publisher Bluewater Productions released a series of comic books featuring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on March 11. The company says it has already sold 7,500 copies of each to distributors. ""We really want to show strong, independent, female role models in comics,"" said Darren Davis, president of Bluewater Productions. Another company released comics about President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain during the presidential election. Then they decided that Hillary Clinton's story needed to be told. ""She was the first [major] female presidential candidate, so we just started with [her], and there was so much interest in it,"" said Jason Schultz, executive vice president of Bluewater Productions. The first two issues in Female Force, already released, feature Clinton and Palin. The next two will feature Caroline Kennedy and First Lady Michelle Obama. The Michelle Obama comic is expected to be released in April, and has pre-sold 28,000 copies. The next set will feature other ""strong, independent women"" such as Princess Diana, Schultz said. Comic fans approve of the idea. ""I think it just says, like, that women are important,"" one comic book fan told CNN. Another added, ""It shows that comics aren't just about guys in tights beating each other up -- it's about information, it's about understanding people a little better,"" said another reader. Richard Laermer, CEO of a public relations firm and author of several books on marketing, said he's not surprised. ""We're in a very politically minded time right now,"" he said. The creators expect to expand the comic book world to a larger demographic with the books. ""It's bringing a whole new demographic to comic books,"" Schultz said. ""It just shows little girls, young women, that they can be anything they want,"" he added. Mary Ellen Balchunis, an assistant professor of political science at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said ""getting girls [interested in politics] at a younger age is brilliant."" ""I think it's great that they're doing these comic books,"" Balchunis said. ""In the past, women have shown a low level of political efficacy."" She said the choices are ""fabulous,"" because ""these are the women who are at the top of the totem pole right now."" Each comic will be biographical, Schultz said. ""With Hillary, it starts with her life and ends up with her as Secretary of State."" ""It would be fun to see how the superhero Hillary sort of pushes her way forth and shows people what she did in her life. To me that's just awesome,"" said Laermer. Another professor of political science said the way the women are portrayed will be important. ""Comic books, by definition, are caricatures, but there are different ways of doing those caricatures,"" said Landon Storrs, an associate professor of history at the University of Houston. ""So it's a question of what the artists go for. If they just tap into familiar stereotypes, then they could reinforce negative ideas about powerful women, even as they are trying to do the opposite,"" she added. The fact that real, living women are now in comic books is another barrier that Davis and Schultz have broken through, historian and author Trina Robbins said. ""It's about time. They've never done a major living woman,"" she said. ""I think what's good is they're doing women in politics and not Paris Hilton."" LaNeice Collins reported from New York.

189,"Washington (CNN) -- Alexander Haig, who managed the Nixon administration during the Watergate crisis and served a controversial stint as secretary of state under President Reagan, died on Saturday. He was 85. Haig died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, after he was admitted there on January 28, spokesman Gary Stephenson said. ""He served his country well. For that he should be remembered,"" said William Bennett, who was secretary of education during the Reagan administration. ""He carried himself well. He carried himself with dignity and honor."" The White House issued a statement mourning Haig, saying he ""exemplified our finest warrior-diplomat tradition of those who dedicate their lives to public service."" A top official in the administrations of three presidents -- Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan -- Haig served as Nixon's chief of staff during the Watergate political crisis, a scandal that dogged the administration in the 1970s. ""There was a time during the Watergate crisis when President Nixon was nearly incapacitated,"" said political analyst and CNN contributor David Gergen, who worked with Haig during the Nixon and Reagan administrations. ""He had a hard time focusing, so obviously obsessed with the scandal and the gathering storms around him. I watched Al Haig keep the government moving. I thought it was a great act of statesmanship and service to the country."" Haig became secretary of state during the Reagan administration and drew controversy for his much-criticized remark on television after the president was shot and wounded by John Hinckley in March 1981. ""As of now, I am in control here in the White House,"" Haig said as Vice President George H.W. Bush was headed to Washington from Texas. Haig said he wasn't bypassing the rules; he was just trying to manage the crisis until the vice president arrived. However, he was highly criticized for his behavior, and many observers believe it doomed his political ambitions. Born December 2, 1924, in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, Alexander Meigs Haig Jr. was raised by his mother after he lost his father at age 10. He attended the University of Notre Dame for two years before transferring to the U.S. Military Academy in 1944. After his graduation in 1947, he served in Japan and later served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's staff in Japan during the Korean War. He also served in Vietnam, where he earned the distinguished service cross for heroism in combat. He also won the Purple Heart and Silver Star twice. Haig served as supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe for five years. There was an assassination attempt on him in Brussels in 1979 as he was being driven to NATO headquarters. A public official known for his loyalty, Haig had hawkish foreign policy views, and Gergen said he could be tough and ""combustible."" ""He was first and foremost a soldier,"" Gergen said. Haig was assistant to National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger in the Nixon White House and was involved in the Paris peace agreements that brought an end to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He was long rumored to be Deep Throat, the Washington Post's inside source on the Watergate break-in and cover-up that eventually destroyed Nixon's presidency. W. Mark Felt, then a high-ranking FBI official, declared in 2005 that he was the source. ""Great tensions"" in the Reagan administration simmered over his stances, and Gergen said, ""There was a sense in the White House that he was grabbing too much power. ""He wanted to be the, quote, vicar of foreign policy, and there was a lot of pushback from the White House on that. He felt that he had been guaranteed by Ronald Reagan a role as a strong secretary of state and the reins of power would be in his hands. He resented the White House staff trying to manage him,"" Gergen said. ""My own sense is that he has been underappreciated,"" he said. TIME: Read why Haig left the Reagan White House . As secretary of state, Haig tried shuttle diplomacy to head off war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982, but he failed. He opposed Reagan's handling of Iran and disagreed with the president's plan on aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. He eventually left the Reagan administration after 18 months and made a run for president in 1988, pulling out before the New Hampshire primary. He backed Bob Dole instead of George H.W. Bush when he dropped out. Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.

Obama originally promised to deliver the speech during his first 100 days, but senior administration officials say the date slipped in part because of security and logistical issues. The officials stressed, however, that the Secret Service still has deep security concerns, given the continued tumult in the Mideast. Obama chose Turkey, a more secular state, as the site of his first presidential speech to a Muslim majority nation, on April 6. He told the Turkish legislature in Ankara that the ""United States is not and will never be at war with Islam."" Obama will follow his visit to Egypt with a trip to the remains of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany on June 5. He is then scheduled to take part in ceremonies commemorating the 65th anniversary of the World War II Allied landings in Normandy, France.

191,"New York (CNN) -- President Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday by talking about war and the limits of nonviolence. But he also praised the peacemakers of the past and said the world can and should still strive for peace. ""Let us reach for the world that ought to be,"" he told the 1,000-member audience at Oslo City Hall in Norway. ""Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace."" The Nobel committee's choice of Obama as this year's laureate sparked debate, in part because he is a president waging two wars abroad. Obama said force is sometimes necessary, but said that is simply ""a recognition of history, the imperfections of man and the limits of reason."" Read a transcript of Obama's acceptance speech . Fareed Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria: GPS,"" spoke to CNN about the speech . CNN: What message was President Obama trying to send the world in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech? Fareed Zakaria: The speech reflected his basic philosophy, which is why it worked so well. I think Obama is somebody who is a realist-idealist. He tries to balance idealism with the realities in the world. He clearly believes in the idea of doing good in the world, but believes you have to be pragmatic and realizes the dangers of over-reaching. CNN: Will the focus on the Afghanistan war being ""just"" be well received by world leaders? Zakaria: Most of the world supports the war in Afghanistan. The UN approved it, and over 50 countries are participating one way or another, so countries won't react negatively. Obama wanted to remind people, including those in his own party here in the U.S., that the Afghanistan war has a morally legitimate basis and that there are occasions in history where force is necessary. CNN: Are there any potential pitfalls to spending so much of the speech defending the war on moral grounds? Zakaria: The great danger of moral certitude is that you get distracted from the practical issue of whether things are working. Are we creating a stable government? Are we being successful against the Taliban and al Qaeda? From Woodrow Wilson to Vietnam, the question of whether a military action is morally legitimate can overshadow whether it works. CNN: Does the speech give us any window into how Obama might conduct U.S. foreign policy going forward? Zakaria: The Afghanistan speech last week and the Nobel speech are the two clearest statements of his worldview. He isn't making a broad statement like President Bush, when he vowed to end tyranny in the world. Obama says the U.S. is a force for good, but is engaging with the world and is trying to avoid open-ended commitments. Obama wants the U.S. to play a world role that is progressive and idealistic, but remains aware of the practical limitations inherent in trying to operate in a messy world.",0.5956017,9401
192,"HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Director Antoine Fuqua, the force behind films such as ""Training Day"" and ""Shooter,"" turned his focus to creating CNN's exclusive short film ""From MLK to Today,"" which airs at 7 p.m. ET Monday. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua, 43, says he didn't believe he would see an African-American president in his lifetime. Before flying off to the Sundance Film Festival to premiere his latest action-thriller, ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" starring Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke and Don Cheadle, Fuqua, 43, stopped by the CNN newsroom in Hollywood to discuss the making of this film. He outlined his vision for the piece, which chronicles America's civil rights journey from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Barack Obama. CNN: As a filmmaker, you work with people like Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. Why are you sitting here in our edit bay doing this project? Antoine Fuqua: Because it's Martin Luther King, and because it's Barack Obama's story. And because it's CNN. It's important to be a part of history, and a part of inspiring people today. I think this is one of the biggest times in my life -- besides my children. So why wouldn't I be here? What else would I be doing except flying to Sundance to promote my movie! [Laughs]  Watch a clip from ""From MLK to Today"" » . CNN: You were born in the '60s, so you were very young during the civil rights movement. You were barely out of diapers when Martin Luther King was assassinated. Fuqua: I am familiar with the history because I love history. African-Americans -- I feel we cannot ever forget our past. Not in an angry or negative way -- just to know where we come from, so we get a better sense of where we're going, and how to get there, and what not to do. I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know. CNN: What do you remember from your childhood? Fuqua: I remember being afraid at times. I remember the Black Panthers. When I was a little boy, the men that were around me were part of a movement. There was a lot of tension. There were a lot of weapons around. There was talk of FBI. I was a little kid, you know -- 6, 5 years old. I didn't really know what it meant. But there was a lot of fear -- a lot of fear of police, or of leaving your neighborhood. CNN: Did you experience much racism growing up in Pittsburgh? Fuqua: I remember a lot of racism. I mean, we used to get beat up by the police. We used to go to certain areas, and cops would slap you around, and grab you by your collar and treat you a certain way. I remember getting on a bus and drivers would treat us disrespectfully, assuming we were going to misbehave. And we were just going to school. I got into fights at school. ... No real reason, except for color of the skin. I don't think they even understood really. CNN: Did you understand? Fuqua: Not really. I didn't really understand it. I was used to it. I had an understanding of it at that age, which was I was black and they were white, and I was poor and they had money. CNN: Did you think there were certain things you couldn't accomplish because you were black? What about being a director? Fuqua: When I was a little kid, I used to sleep in my grandmother's basement, and I would read magazines, and books and things -- and I would dream of places I would go. I remember thinking, ""Well, if it's just a matter of money to leave my neighborhood, then I have to make money."" Then I read something about craftsmanship -- which is not a word you used often in that time in the ghettos. If you learn a craft, then you can make a living for the rest of your life. So I went to school to be an electrical engineer. And when I was in school, I took a Baroque art class. They were talking about Caravaggio, who was a Baroque painter. Now he was from the streets in Italy, and he used to paint these very provocative paintings of people he lived with on the streets -- beggars, and prostitutes and things. It reminded me of my world -- in the sense of being a young kid on the streets, growing up, seeing a lot of provocative images that I was probably too young to see -- and I would express them, and I would do little illustrations or I would paint on a wall. Then I started to study [Akira] Kurosawa, who was a painter as well as a director. I saw his movies -- ""The Seven Samurai"" and all that -- and I thought, ""Wow, that's even more interesting, because it's a moving picture and you get to tell a story."" CNN: And now you're telling the story of Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. Did you ever think you'd see an African-American president of the United States? Fuqua: Never. Never. Not in my time. I thought somewhere down the line it would happen, but not in my time -- because I still deal with racial situations. Sometimes people don't do it blatantly. They'll say something, or they'll behave a certain way when I know they don't normally behave that way. As a director, you run into walls where they say, ""Well, it doesn't translate well overseas. You know, you need to have a white movie star in it."" There's some truth to that. So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president? You know, the CEO of the country? And obviously, we are. We are ready. CNN: As a director, you have this story about an unbelievable presidential election, where a first-term senator wins. Would you have cast Barack Obama in that role? Fuqua: In a heartbeat, in a heartbeat. He's like a movie star. Look at the guy. He's dashing, he's charming, he's got a little swagger about him. He reminds me of Denzel in their way. [Fuqua directed Washington in the 2001 action-thriller ""Training Day.""] I was with Denzel over Christmas, and they're very similar -- their mannerisms at times. CNN: In the short film you're directing for us, you've drawn the parallel between Obama and Martin Luther King. Fuqua: It is the passing of the torch between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. I think Barack Obama is the ""dream."" I mean, we're all the dream. I think it's a bigger picture than one man. CNN: What's the message you want to convey with your short film? Fuqua: Hope. A sense of the past. But more than anything, I would love people to walk away feeling like we've just begun.",0.594827,3184
194,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Barack Obama sometimes gets ribbed for his outsized ideas, like the massive stage built in Denver, Colorado, to accept the Democratic presidential nomination. But an artist in Barcelona, Spain, may be about to outdo the candidate himself. Large-format sketches have long been a focus of artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada's work. The artist plans to create a gigantic face of Obama sculpted from gravel and sand, which will cover nearly 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of Barcelona beachfront before the U.S. elections. ""The size of the piece is intrinsic to its value,"" the artist, Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada, said Saturday. He hopes it will be big enough to be seen on Google Earth. ""Obama's personality -- his youth, personal history and message of a new politics -- has fused with the historical moment to create someone larger than life,"" says the artist's dossier about the work, titled ""Expectation."" The huge size also alludes ""to the global impact of this election,"" the dossier adds. iReport.com: What do you want to ask Sen. Obama? Rodriguez-Gerada, 42, is a Cuban-born American who grew up in North Plainfield, New Jersey, near New York, and now lives in Barcelona. The artist, who has long focused on large-format sketches and other designs, said he had been planning to put an anonymous face on Barcelona's Mediterranean beachfront but shelved the idea. Then, six weeks ago, he decided it should be Obama's face. ""Everybody's doing work about Obama,"" he said. ""I was talking to my wife about the importance of this election internationally. It all came together."" The idea, that is. The execution of the project is still a work in progress, but with a lot of help pouring in. The artist has created what he calls a ""vectored image"" from different photos of Obama, showing the candidate's face looking left over his shoulder. He will use 500 tons of material -- mainly gravel but also sand and possibly some soil in black, brown and white tones -- to create the image on a flat piece of land slightly raised and overlooking the Mediterranean, near downtown Barcelona. The artist and a Barcelona newspaper say the city has temporarily ceded use of the land for the project. The portrait of Obama's face will be 445 feet long by 264 feet wide (139.28 by 82.67 meters) and the artist hopes to have it done by late next week or no later than November 3, the day before the U.S. elections. The materials have been donated, along with bulldozers and their drivers. The crews will initially spread the materials along white lines, and other markers that will be laid out according to the sketch. Then, the artist's technical team will direct volunteers with garden rakes to put the final touches on the materials, making sure the various colors are spread properly on the ground in order to depict Obama's eyes, hair, cheeks and collar, according to the plans. Rodriguez-Gerada said he'll need to raise about $18,700 (15,000 euros) for other costs, such as rakes and gloves for volunteers, documentation, even portable toilets for the crew. He said it's his ""biggest work ever, in scale and complexity."" He's a self-described political independent until recently, when he joined Democrats Abroad in Spain. But he added that the art project is his alone, without help from any political organization or campaign, and he won't be paid for it. Rodriguez-Gerada said this project also aims to address the issue of ""trying to find heroes with empathy for the problems of the world. We really need empathy from Barack Obama. There's a need to do positive things for the future."" Obama's giant face would be environmentally friendly, with all natural colors, so the materials could be recycled, the artist said. Rodriguez-Gerada's not sure how long the face would remain in place in Barcelona, because the site is slated to be used for a new municipal building. But even if the face isn't permanent, it might be the start of outsized artistic images of Obama. Barcelona journalist Matt Elmore contributed to this report.",0.5939559,1146
195,"(CNN) -- Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain in August will be on the same stage for the first time in the 2008 presidential campaign. The Rev. Rick Warren says he makes no endorsements because he shepherds ""both sides of the flock."" The Rev. Rick Warren has invited them to appear at a leadership and compassion forum in his Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, on August 16. Warren, the author of the best-selling book ""The Purpose Driven Life"" spoke with CNN's Wolf Blitzer by phone Tuesday from Sao Paulo, Brazil. BLITZER: Pastor Warren, how did you do it? How did you convince both of them to show up? PASTOR RICK WARREN, SADDLEBACK CHURCH: Well, Wolf, they've both been friends for a long time. I knew both John and Barack before either of them decided to run for office, had talked with them. Both of them have helped me in the past with our peace plan and with -- they've sent messages to Saddleback at some of our conferences. And so I just thought let's -- you know, I might be the guy to get them together. So, I called them up and said, let's do it. And they said, well, we'll do it if you be the only questioner, if you don't have a forum, don't have a panel. And if you'll ask all the questions, then we'll do it. BLITZER: But they're not going to be together. They're going to be separate. These are going to be Pastor Warren and Barack Obama, followed by Pastor Warren and John McCain. But there's not going to be any interchange between the two of them, is that right? WARREN: Yes. I'm going to -- my plan is to bring them out on stage together at the beginning or at the end. But what I want to do is I want to let each of them talk without interrupting each other. And it's not a debate format. There will be plenty of time for debates. What I want to do is get people to know the real person like I know them without a time barrier and a buzzer and a time for rebuttal. Let them just speak what they need to say. BLITZER: The last time we spoke was right after you invited Barack Obama when he was still running for the Democratic presidential nomination. You got some criticism from a few fellow evangelicals out there. You called him in the interview with me an amazing, an amazing man, Barack Obama. Could you see yourself supporting him for president? WARREN: Well, I don't support anybody for president publicly. I never endorse. I never campaign. You know, as a pastor, I don't really think that's my role. I have to shepherd both sides of the flock. And I have a church full of Democrats and a church full of Republicans and a church full of independents. So, I think they're both amazing men. I've known them for a long time. They're both very, very different. They have both different theories of government, different theories of leadership, different approaches to life. And I -- what I do is I think, because I know them, I think I can set up an environment that people can actually say, oh, so that's what that guy's really like. And I think I can do that for both John and for Barack.",0.59177506,854
196,"Editor's note: Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. A supporter of Sen. Barack Obama, Martin is a nationally syndicated columnist and Chicago, Illinois-based radio host. He is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Please visit his Web site. Roland S. Martin urges the candidates to stop with the lofty talk and simplistic solutions and be specific. (CNN) -- If you are a member of America's middle class in this presidential year, you are sort of like a blue-chip football recruit, lavished with praise, attention and adoration from fawning coaches and alumni who would love nothing better than to land the prized player to win the national championship. For ""Coach"" John McCain and ""Coach"" Barack Obama, the title to win is president of the United States, and like the big-time football coaches, they will say and do anything to make it happen. Tax cuts? Oh, absolutely, we don't want you to feel any more pain. Let the rich -- and the poor -- deal with carrying the burden. You want more jobs? Sure, we're going  to force companies that send jobs overseas to make them stay at home because we know you need those long disappearing and high-paying manufacturing jobs that helped build this nation. Can't afford to send your kids to college? Don't sweat it. We've got tax credits, Pell grants, super-duper loans and all kinds of other options to make this a reality. Are they cutting back on health care at your job? No big deal. Coach McCain says he's got some nifty tax credits lined up to tickle your fancy and ignite your soul. Coach Obama? He's going to go for the whole enchilada by pushing for virtual universal health care. Oh, these guys are wonderful with their sales pitches. They have the ability to make every single one of you feel so special and loved; no one else is more important to them -- at that moment. I must admit, the pathetic pining and pandering for middle-class votes has turned so moronic that at times it drives me nuts. First, who in the world are we even talking about? If you listen to the candidates and their campaigns, those in the middle class could make upward of $200,000 a year, while some suggest middle class means earning as little as $20,000. I moderated a panel Tuesday for the National Black MBA Association and heard descriptions of the lower middle class, the middle class and the upper middle class. Someone even suggested that it's really about a ""state of mind."" That's right. It boils down to how we feel and think. If that's the case, then you can have $5 million in the bank, but if you love your family, go to church and share the same values as others around you, you're middle class. Please, can we just stop with lofty talk and plain-spoken and simplistic solutions and be as specific as possible? There are really four fundamental issues affecting middle-class voters. Jobs . We've seen a loss of 600,000 jobs under President Bush, so how exactly will McCain and Obama create jobs? Is there anything in their past that shows they have the ability to do just that? I've heard ""drill, drill, drill!"" from McCain, and Obama says we're going to turn the old textile and steel mills into a green machine by targeting wind and other sources of energy. Housing . Congress is providing a backstop for Wall Street -- making billions available if cash is needed. What will McCain and Obama actually do to keep folks from losing their homes? Oh, I know a lot of people suggest that these middle-class folks should have read the fine print and not gotten in over their heads, but if something is good for Wall Street, why not Main Street? Health care . This is no joke, and a primary reason why Americans file for bankruptcy. I know. My appendix ruptured in 2000 while covering the Democratic National Convention, forcing me to spend five days in a Los Angeles hospital and accruing more than $70,000 in hospital bills. Yep, I didn't have health insurance. I was just a 29-year-old never-been-sick freelancer stuck out in the cold. The pressure of that led to falling behind on my mortgage, and the start of foreclosure proceedings. Bankruptcy was the only thing that saved me, and by the grace of God, my finances turned around, and this month, I'm making my final payment. McCain says a $5,000 tax credit for health care will help, but the problem with that is you have to pay the dough upfront, and then claim it on your taxes. But what happens when they want the money now? Obama says the answer is his health care plan, but that switch won't be flipped immediately. So what happens while the laborious debate takes place? I just wait for my MRI until Washington finishes debating and the special interests pick the plan to death? Education . For many Americans, education is a ticket to the middle class and beyond. Much of the time the candidates talk about vouchers. Look, that's not going to solve the education problem. What we should be hearing them talk about is the inequity of the school systems. Children living in wealthy school districts get tons of money and the best qualified  teachers, while poorer districts are forced to make do with less qualified teachers and without computers or even basic amenities. The bottom line . Remember those blue-chip players? Today, they are telling a coach: If you want me to sign, promise that I'll start. No play, no sign. That's what middle-class Americans must tell the candidates. If you are unwilling to put your personal credibility and integrity behind your campaign pledges, then you don't get my vote. And if you give away your vote just because someone is a Democrat or Republican, or a man or a woman, or black or white, and you end up getting screwed in the end, you have no one to blame but yourself. So use the most powerful thing you have to demand real answers to your real problems from McCain, Obama, Joe Biden and Sarah Palin: your vote. The power is literally in your hands.

197,"(CNN) -- Retired Adm. William Fallon resigned in March as leader of the U.S. military's Central Command after reportedly clashing with President Bush. Retired Adm. William Fallon told CNN he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command. During an interview Tuesday on CNN's American Morning,"" Fallon denied a magazine article's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran. CNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran. Kyra Phillips: How were you informed that this was it? Who called you? Fallon: The story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and, I'm sure, for the president. One of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command. And the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that I was disloyal to the president and that I might be trying to countermand his orders, the policies of the country. ... The fact that people might be concerned that I was not appropriately doing what I was supposed to do and following orders bothered me, and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation.  Watch Fallon break his silence » . Phillips: Do you feel you were pushed out? Fallon: What was important was not me. It wasn't some discussion about where I was with issues. It was the fact that we have a war in progress. We had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in Iraq and Afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what I might have said or thought or someone perceived I said. That's the motivation. Phillips: [Esquire magazine writer] Tom Barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with Iran. Is that true? Fallon: I don't believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran. The situation with Iran is very complex. People sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we're against Iran, we want to go to war with Iran, we want to be close to them. ... The reality is in international politics that [there are] many aspects to many of these situations, and I believe in our relationship with Iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based. At the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common. Phillips: Would have you negotiated with Iran? Fallon: It's not my position to negotiate with Iran. I was the military commander in the Middle East. I had responsibility for our people and their safety and well-being. It's the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation. Phillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn't say to you, ""This is what I want to do,"" and did you stand up and say, ""No, sir. Bad move""? Fallon: It's probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way. Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran. We have a lot of things going on, and there are many other ways to solve problems. I was very open and candid in my advice. I'm not shy. I will tell people, the leaders, what I think and offer my opinions on Iran and other things, and continue to do that. Phillips: Do you think that cost you your job? Fallon: No, I don't believe so at all. It's a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts, and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be, then we've got to make a change. Phillips: We talk about your no-nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president. Your critics say that Admiral Fallon is a difficult man to get along with. Are you? Fallon: You probably could ask my wife about that. She would have a few things to say. I think that what's really important here is that when I was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago, I believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the region. I had some experience in dealing with international problems. I certainly had a lot of combat experience, and I was brought in in an attempt to make things better. That's what I went about doing. Again, there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so. A lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items. The important items were the people, what they're doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home. Phillips: Hillary Clinton [and] Barack Obama talk about pulling troops out by next year. John McCain says, no, we've got to stay the course. What is the best course for Iraq right now?  Watch what the candidates say about war policy » . Fallon: I believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there. Dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country. Again, this situation is quite complex -- many angles. There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand. The political side of things in Iraq has got to move forward. That appears to be improving. People have to have confidence in their futures. They want to have stability. They would like to be able to raise their families in peace. They would like to have a job. They would like to look to tomorrow as better than today. It takes more than the military, but the military is essential to provide stability and security. The idea we would walk away from Iraq strikes me as not appropriate. We all want to bring our troops home. We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended. Given where we are today, the progress that they've made particularly in the last couple months, I think it's very, very heartening to see what's really happened here. The right course of action is to continue to work with the Iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that's appropriate to conditions on the ground.",0.590497,591
198,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House communications director Anita Dunn fired back at criticism from TV commentator Glenn Beck on Friday, saying that a Mao Tse-tung quote Beck took issue with was picked up from legendary GOP strategist Lee Atwater. White House communications director Anita Dunn she picked up Mao Tse-tung from a legendary Republican. ""The Mao quote is one I picked up from the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater from something I read in the late 1980s, so I hope I don't get my progressive friends mad at me,"" Dunn told CNN. As for Beck's criticism: ""The use of the phrase 'favorite political philosophers' was intended as irony, but clearly the effort fell flat -- at least with a certain Fox commentator whose sense of irony may be missing."" On Thursday night's program, Beck showed exclusive video of Dunn discussing the communist leader, who was responsible for a cultural revolution in 1966 that included re-education camps and setting the army and students on witch hunts against his opponents. Millions of Chinese suffered or died, most notably teachers, writers, political opponents or anyone deemed a ""reactionary."" Dunn, taped in a speech in what appears to be a church, said the leader's philosophies were a guidepost for her own strategy on politics. She also praised the philosophy used by religious icon Mother Teresa. ""The third lesson and tip actually comes from two of my favorite political philosophers: Mao Tse-tung and Mother Theresa -- not often coupled with each other, but the two people I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point which is 'you're going to make choices; you're going to challenge; you're going to say why not; you're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before."" The comments set Beck into a tirade. ""It's insanity. This is her hero's work,"" he said. ""She thinks of this man's work all the time? ""It would be like me saying to you, 'you know who my favorite political philosopher is? Adolf Hitler.' Have you read Mein Kampf? [She wants to] fight your fight like Hitler did,"" Beck said. Dunn recently blasted Fox News saying that the cable news organization often operates as either ""the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party."" ""When he [Obama] goes on Fox, he understands that he's not really going on it as a news network at this point. He's going to debate the opposition. And that's fine. He never minds doing that. ""They're widely viewed as a part of the Republican Party. Take [the GOP's] talking points, put them on the air, take [the GOP's] opposition research, put them on the air,"" Dunn said. Fox News in a statement to CNN said its programming was comparable to the editorial page of a newspaper. Still, Beck wasted no time Thursday in using Dunn's comments to blast the Obama administration for promoting what he deems a radical agenda. ""America, how many radicals is it going to take? How many radicals surrounding our president before you understand that when the president said he wants to transform the country, he wants to transform it all right,"" Beck said. Dunn pointed out that during his presidential campaign and since being elected President Obama has been interviewed by Fox News and will be again in the future.  Watch more of Dunn's comments » . ""He'll go on Fox because he engages with ideological opponents,"" Dunn said. ""He has done that before, and he'll do it again."" But it's not just Dunn, a Democrat, who has used Mao as someone she reads. Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog group, points out that former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, also a Fox News contributor, quoted Mao in a 1995 Roll Call profile.

Beck led the charge against Obama's former green jobs czar Van Jones over a petition Jones signed in 2004 calling for an investigation into whether government officials deliberately allowed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to occur. Jones said of the petition on the Web site 911truth.org: ""I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever."" Jones has also come under fire for comments he made, also before his White House job, including those in a video on YouTube. In it, he uses a vulgar expression to describe Republicans. Jones resigned from his post in September, saying in a statement that he came to Washington to ""fight for others, not for myself."" ""I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past. We need all hands on deck, fighting for the future,"" Jones' statement said.

199,"(ESSENCE) -- Two weeks ago, 3-year-old Jaquan Reed was fatally shot on Chicago, Illinois', West Side. Men participate in the Million Father March to support children going to school. While the case shook the city, such shootings involving children are no longer rare in the Windy City. Within the current academic year, 36 Chicago-area students were killed. Essence.com spoke to Phillip Jackson, a well-known political activist in the city and also founder of Black Star Project, a Chicago-based community outreach group, about what is being done to end the senseless shootings involving children. The following is an edited version of that interview: . ESSENCE: There have been so many shootings and deaths. Please tell us what's happening in Chicago? ESSENCE: Xerox names Ursula Burns CEO . Phillip Jackson: This is a national catastrophe that is happening while we as a country do nothing. We're asking for national attention. This is a pandemic. We will not be able to solve this problem in Chicago unless they can solve this same problem in Houston [Texas] and other cities.  Watch our panelists talk about the growing violence in Chicago » . ESSENCE: The nation's first black president is from Chicago. And you still do not feel like there is enough attention placed on this problem? Jackson: Newspapers from all over the world have come to our offices this past week to say, ""What is happening in President Barack Obama's backyard?"" And 75 percent of the children murdered here in Chicago happened within eight miles of President Obama's former house. So if he doesn't respond as president, and we are hoping he does, he needs to respond as a resident. ESSENCE: What has been the police response? Jackson: They've put together a 400-unit gang SWAT team. They're trying to match guns with the gangs. But with all of that they can't stop one murder because they're approaching it from the wrong way. ESSENCE: Obama's time in office . ESSENCE: What is the right way to approach it? Jackson: Instill strong families and strong communities. Build strong parenting groups. Do you know what has been the best mentoring organization in the United States of America? Street gangs. ESSENCE: In other cities, where there is a lot of gang violence, like Baltimore [Maryland], there are regular people in the community coming together and trying to fix it. What are regular people doing about this in Chicago? Jackson: First of all, they're raising their voices. Number two, they're rallying, they're marching, and they're organizing. That's what this effort is going to take. Number three, they're engaging in recreational programs. ESSENCE: Toledo cops say teen provoked them . So there is more happening at the grassroots level than at the federal level. But those people cannot succeed without support. And that's why we're asking President Obama to bring his resources. ESSENCE: What is the mind-set of Chicago youth with all of these horrendous acts of violence occurring? Jackson: Hopelessness, desperation, anger. They live in America. They see how America takes care of the whole world but won't take care of them in the communities in which they live.",0.5863761,4141
200,"(CNN) -- A Florida man is using billboards with an image of the burning World Trade Center to encourage votes for a Republican presidential candidate, drawing criticism for politicizing the 9/11 attacks. Businessman Mike Meehan says he has put up three billboards such as this one around Orlando, Florida. ""Please Don't Vote for a Democrat"" reads the type over the picture of the twin towers after hijacked airliners hit them on September, 11, 2001. Mike Meehan, a St. Cloud, Florida, businessman who paid to post the billboards in the Orlando area, said former President Clinton should have put a stop to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda before 9/11. He said a Republican president would have done so. ""I believe 9/11 could have been prevented if we'd had a Republican president at the time,"" Meehan said Wednesday on CNN's ""American Morning."" But Democrats and Republicans are saying Meehan shouldn't be using a 9/11 image to make a political point. ""This is a blatant exploitation of that terrible tragedy for political and, perhaps even worse, personal gain,"" Bill Robinson, the Orange County, Florida, Democratic Party chairman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando. The local Republican Party called the billboard ""inappropriate,"" according to WFTV. ""There are many ways to convey the importance of national security in this election without going to extremes, and we encourage a constructive dialogue,"" the Florida Republican Party said in a statement Tuesday. According to Meehan, President Bush has done ""an excellent job ... going after these terrorists.""  Watch Meehan's take on terrorism and the election » . ""You got to remember all the ... people that George Bush did catch and how much success he did have. And we haven't had an attack on this soil since 9/11,"" Meehan said. ""Unlike Bill Clinton, who actually had bin Laden right in his hand and through the CIA and other high officials decide to get him go,"" Meehan said. In a 2006 interview with ""Fox News Sunday,"" Clinton said he authorized the killing of bin Laden in 2000 after the attack on the Navy warship USS Cole in Yemen, but the order was never carried out because U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies refused to certify that bin Laden was behind the Cole attack. ""I got closer to killing him than anybody has gotten since,"" Clinton said in the 2006 interview. Meehan also is using the billboard to promote his Web site, the republicansong.com, where he's trying to sell copies of his song, ""Please Don't Vote for a Democrat."" The song goes beyond the national security issue, ripping Democrats on taxation and energy issues, too. ""They want to take the money from the hard workin' man, and give it to the lazy folks that don't give a damn,"" Meehan sings. Another verse takes on the oil issue. ""We're not fightin' for oil, we got plenty if we drill it,"" he sings. The song's not a moneymaker, he said, just an effort to recoup some of what he's invested in the billboards. A copy of the song on CD cost $5 on the Web site, and the site points out that Meehan can be hired to perform at a ""concert, party, meeting or event."" ""I'm willing to pay the cost for the fact that our soldiers that have died protecting this country have paid a heck of a lot more than what these billboards cost,"" Meehan told ""American Morning."" Florida resident Mary Anderson told WFTV she doesn't see politics when she's looking at the billboard. ""Just looking at it, I'm not thinking about Democrat or Republican, I'm thinking about the twin towers and all the people killed,"" she told WFTV.",0.58543706,7142
201,"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy has spoken for the first time about the reasons her divorce in an interview with a French newspaper. The announcement ended weeks of speculation over their marriage. Cecilia Sarkozy told L'Est Republicain on Friday that the couple's relationship had not been able to survive the glare of the media spotlight following a highly public separation in 2005. The Sarkozys announced on Thursday they were divorcing by mutual consent after 11 years of marriage. A former model, Cecilia Sarkozy said that she was not comfortable with her position as first lady. ""I am someone who likes the shadows, serenity, tranquility. I had a husband who was a public man, I always knew that, I accompanied him for 20 years. But me, I think that is not my place. It is no longer my place,"" she was quoted as saying. The couple has been dogged by persistent rumors of infidelities, which Cecilia Sarkozy seemed to confirm in her newspaper interview. Explaining the events that led to the couple separating in 2005, she said: ""Two years ago an event happened of which unfortunately the whole of France is aware. In 2005, I met someone, I fell in love and I left."" The French president, in Portugal for an EU summit, has declined to comment on his marriage breakdown. His divorce comes as he deals with crippling public sector strikes at home that have shut down much of France's transit system. Cecilia Sarkozy was a smiling figure at her husband's inauguration in May as she stood with the couple's five children. But she said recently she didn't see herself as having any role at all as the president's wife. For the French public, news of the divorce is unlikely to come as a shock. French presidents and their spouses have a long tradition of leading separate lives, even while carrying on the functions of state. Former President Francois Mitterrand not only lived apart from his wife, Danielle, but he maintained a secret second family that turned up in public only at his funeral. Jacques Chirac, who stepped down when Sarkozy was elected this year, hinted at a number of affairs. He and his wife lived largely separate lives, appearing together only at presidential functions. Nicolas Sarkozy said at the start of his term that he had no worries as president, except for his wife. E-mail to a friend .",0.5849009,4558
202,"(CNN) --   Global activist and U2 frontman Bono attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York to push world leaders to join his ONE campaign in fighting disease, poverty, and hunger. He talked to CNN's John Roberts on ""American Morning"" about recent successes and what's next. Bono said politicians who love signing checks but not cashing hurt plans to help the world's poor. ROBERTS: All this talk has been about the economy collapsing, $700 billion bailout. Congress is absolutely absorbed with that. Did that in any way affect what you were trying to do this week? Are people more focused on this economy than in helping out developing nations? BONO: We got good news this week. I know normally I'm on your program with bad news -- the whingeing rock star -- but it's great. There's a disease, malaria -- it's 3,000 African kids die every day of mosquito bites. Sounds mad, but it's true. And people have committed and it looks like the funds are on the table so that that disease will be no more by 2015. That makes people like me punch the air and everyone who wears a ONE T-shirt and all our white band campaigners on college campuses all over the country -- it was a great day for them yesterday so we're celebrating that. I know it's extraordinary, that while you're having this meltdown on the markets, that people could even concentrate on this stuff, but I'm really grateful that they did. We had both [presidential] candidates make very powerful statements about the necessity for nonmilitary tools, for instance, in foreign policy. This is an America that both candidates want to show to the rest of the world -- the greatness of America. ROBERTS: So you're hearing what you want to hear from these candidates? BONO: Yeah. And you couldn't imagine a few years ago that you would have candidates so close to an election talking about this stuff, so yeah.  Watch Bono say how he uses his star status on politicians » . ROBERTS: You were talking to Christine Romans outside the studio, who just did that piece for us a few minutes ago on what else could you do with $700 billion. What could you do with $700 billion? BONO: We wouldn't be asking for that kind of money. These are serious matters, people have lost their jobs. But I think the bill for the whole world -- so America would be like a third of it -- for $25 billion you could absolutely change the world. You could put kids in school, most kids in school. You could eradicate diseases like malaria, as we're saying. We could change the water supplies. But what's important is that people who want to change the world, want to see their country, they see it as a patriotic act to show the world innovation of America, technology of America, pharmacology of America. ROBERTS: For $25 billion, you could put every kid who's out of school in the world into school? That seems like a lot of people for $25 billion. Pretty good return on your investment. BONO: It's a great return on investment. You heard me on your program before talking about debt cancellation. Strangely Americans don't know that because of debt cancellation there are already an extra 29 million African children in school. That's incredible. Because people got out on the streets on the (RED) campaign and stuff like that, there's now 2.5 million Africans on AIDS drugs, which are expensive. So your country is turning for me in the right direction on these issues. ROBERTS: So you're hearing some of what you want to hear, particularly on the malaria issues. But the European Union had promised to increase aid by $50 billion between 2005 and 2010. It looks like they're going to fall $40 billion short. BONO: They are, but they're still ahead of America. That's the bad news. You don't want to get me into the ring. ROBERTS: Absolutely! Come on. BONO: We've had meetings with Sarkozy this week as well as talking with McCain and Palin and as well as always talking with the Obama campaign. We do keep up the pressure on the Europeans, but the Europeans are way ahead of America on aid, just to put it in context. But you're right. They're not coming through on all of it. We will torture them too. That's our job. ROBERTS: You talk a lot about these United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Let me go over a couple of those. It was supposed cut global poverty in half by the year 2015. Universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment by 2010. Begin to reverse the incidence of malaria by 2015. How far along that road are we? BONO: The Millennium Development Goals are in a bit of trouble. It is astonishing to me ... ROBERTS: Whose fault is that? BONO: You know, politicians. They love signing checks, but they don't like cashing them. They love the photograph. These G-8 meetings, you'll see myself and my partner Bob Geldof arm-wrestling with politicians up against the wall. ROBERTS: You're very effective at doing that. You get access to a lot of places. I remember I was on a trip with President Bush once, and you walked on Air Force One. BONO: It's the absurdity of celebrity. I don't consider myself a celebrity in this sense, I think I'm an activist who knows what I'm talking about. But yeah, we get access, and we use it. It's true that there was a very ambitious plan signed up in 2005 that further committed what was decided in the year 2000, that we could actually across eight goals completely change the face of poverty and hunger in the world. And there was a $25 billion bill by 2010 that would enable them to do that. They haven't come through on that. And another day I'll tell you why, but today I'm punching the air because malaria will be no more by 2015. And it's Americans, people from the private sector -- Peter Chernin, Ray Chambers, all kinds of people, Bill Gates, your mayor of this city, [Michael] Bloomberg, is an amazing guy. He's working on this stuff. I just want Americans to know that side of their country because I'm a fan of America. And, again, you would have candidates, you know, like John McCain taking time out this week to talk to us, Barack Obama before. This is fantastic. ROBERTS: I was reading your blog on financialtimes.com. You've been writing all week, doing a great job too. You mentioned in one of your pieces you've been writing some lyrics. And I'm wondering where the lyrics are going. BONO: Statistics don't rhyme. Songwriting comes from such a different part of my brain and such a different part of who I am. ROBERTS: Are you writing about all this? BONO: No, it's strange. It's very strange. I used to work in a garage when I was a kid pumping gas, and I used to dream when I was pumping the gas about getting to rehearsals on a Saturday so I could be with my band and write songs. The work that I'm doing now, as we say, we're working like a dog, living like a shih tzu. We're spoiled people. We travel well, but we work. On these issues, because you're working for the world's poor, we work like dogs. But I find myself at times, sometimes I just wake up in the morning, and I just want to be back with my band in a rehearsal room. ROBERTS: You will be soon. New CD coming out next year. BONO: I'm not complaining about the work. This is the most inspiring thing I've ever been involved in in my life, and it's working. It really is working. And that's why I'm on your show this morning. I just want to thank Americans. ROBERTS: Good luck on the new CD coming out next year. We're looking forward to it.",0.5846039,1170

Martin is the author of the forthcoming book, ""The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House as originally reported by Roland S. Martin"" and of two other books, ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland Martin says conservative critics are wrong to chortle at the defeat of the Chicago Olympic bid. (CNN) -- Whenever President Obama has traveled overseas and offered pointed and direct assessments of the United States, some of them critical, Republicans have ripped him for criticizing America, saying a president should always defend the United States. So I want to hear the explanation by these so-called patriots of their giddy behavior over the United States losing the 2016 Olympic Games. Yes, the United States. The bid that was rejected Friday by the International Olympic Committee was not a Chicago, Illinois, bid. It was the official bid submitted by the United States Olympic Committee and was representative of the nation. Tokyo's bid was that of Japan; Madrid's was that of Spain; and Rio de Janeiro's was that of Brazil. Republicans want to spin the decision as a massive loss by President Obama and the Democrats who have always controlled Chicago politics. ""Hahahahaha,"" wrote Erick Erickson on the conservative ""RedState"" blog, ""I thought the world would love us more now that Bush was gone."" What the critics don't see is that Obama's loss on the Olympics is America's loss. Any red-blooded American who loves to see the American flag raised and the national anthem played when one of our own wins a gold medal should blast the Republicans' giddiness over the loss. I can recall crying along with millions of Americans when our hockey team beat the Russians and won the hockey gold in 1980. Where were those games? Lake Placid, New York. Euphoria spread all across the nation, not only because we beat the mighty Russians, but also because it took place on American soil. When Carl Lewis and Mary Lou Retton dominated the 1984 Olympic Games, we all beamed with pride because they represented the United States on American soil in Los Angeles, California. And when Michael Johnson stormed around the track to obliterate the world record in the 200-meter dash (since broken by Jamaica's Usain Bolt), we relished the win as he took a victory lap around the stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Americans love home field advantage, and we always desire to show the rest of the world what we are made of. I don't care if Republicans want to rip President Obama over going to Copenhagen, Denmark, to pitch for the games. This isn't about politics. It's not about ideology. This is about America. OUR pride. Our chance to shine. Our loss of the games. So, to all the critics happy about us losing the 2016 games, turn in your flag lapel pins and stop boasting of being so patriotic. When an American city loses, like New York did in the the last go-round, we all lose. And all you critics are on the same level as the America haters all across the world. You should be shouted down for not backing your own country. The next time any of you bang out a press release about ""Buy American"" or ""Support our troops,"" remember this moment when your cynical, callous and small-minded brains happily rejoiced when America lost the 2016 Olympic Games. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.",0.58455783,7434
204,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Leon Panetta, chief of staff in President Bill Clinton's White House, will be President-elect Barack Obama's choice to be CIA director, two Democratic officials told CNN on Monday. Leon Panetta, who has a strong background in economics, was chief of staff for President Bill Clinton. The officials also said retired Adm. Dennis Blair, who formerly headed the U.S. Navy's Pacific Command, will be tapped as director of national intelligence. Panetta, 70, has had a long political career, beginning in 1966 when he served as a legislative assistant to U.S. Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel. R-California. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1977, serving California's 16th (now 17th) District until Clinton appointed him to head the Office of Budget and Management in 1993. He was chief of staff from 1994 to 1997. Panetta and his wife, Sylvia, founded and co-direct the Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, which provides study opportunities for students there and at several other schools. He serves on several boards and committees, and lectures internationally on economics. With a strong background in economics, Panetta has little hands-on experience in intelligence. But he is known as a strong manager with solid organizational skills. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who will be the new chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she had not been told in advance of Panetta's selection. ""My position has consistently been that I believe the agency is best served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time,"" the California Democrat said. But Sen. Ron Wyden, a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, said he was consulted on the pick and praised Panetta. ""I believe he has the skills to usher in a new era of accountability at the nation's premier intelligence agency,"" said Wyden, D-Oregon. ""For too long our nation's intelligence community has operated under a policy of questionable effectiveness and legality in which consulting two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee counted as 'consulting with Congress.' "" Sen. Kit Bond, R-Missouri, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, also questioned Panetta's lack of intelligence experience, as did outgoing committee chairman Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, wouldn't comment until Obama makes an announcement, but his spokesman said that Hoekstra ""has called for a new direction and a change in the culture a the CIA for some time."" ""Whether it is Leon Panetta or someone else, it is important the agency move in a new direction,"" Jamal Ware said. Blair, 61, was a 1968 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and attended Oxford University in Britain as a Rhodes scholar at the same time as Clinton. Blair retired from the Navy in 2002. He was the CIA's first associate director of military support and served on the National Security Council. He has been sharply critical of U.S. policy in terms of strategic long-term planning. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's cabinet picks . ""I am in awe of the sophisticated strategies that American politicians can devise and pursue over many years,"" he told a House panel in July. ""They involve very public activities -- speeches, programs, alliances -- but also backroom deals, and stratagems, tactical flexibility but strategic constancy, investment in intellectual and organizational capabilities that will not pay off for years. ""I have yet to see these same brilliant politicians come up with similar strategies to advance the national interest when they come into national office.

205,"Washington (CNN) -- The White House on Friday began releasing the names of visitors as part of a Barack Obama campaign promise to run a more transparent administration. Last month, Norm Eisen, special counsel to the president for ethics and government reform, said records of White House visitors would be made available to the public on an ongoing basis beginning in December. ""We will achieve our goal of making this administration the most open and transparent administration in history not only by opening the doors of the White House to more Americans, but by shining a light on the business conducted inside it,"" he said. ""Americans have a right to know whose voices are being heard in the policymaking process."" As part of that initiative, he offered to look back at records from before the announcement. Eisen said Friday that 110 disclosure requests from September have been processed, yielding nearly 500 visitor records that have been posted on the White House Web site. Since the release covers only those records that are at least 90 days old, the first records cover January 20 to July 31. ""This first release is only the latest in a series of unprecedented steps by the president to increase openness in government,"" Eisen said. Given that up to 100,000 people visit the White House each month, the names published Friday included people with some very familiar names -- including William Ayers, Michael Jordan, Michael Moore, Jeremiah Wright and R.

206,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- From land, water and air, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen are being deployed in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama is safe. A law enforcement agent looks toward Capitol Hill ahead of the inauguration on Tuesday. ""Right now, we have no credible threat that there is any direction of interest on the inauguration,"" Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan told CNN. FBI agents and intelligence officials have been checking with sources around the United States and the world to make sure no leads are overlooked, and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said intelligence will be scrubbed and rescrubbed right through the inauguration. ""We are literally going to be watching this every minute between now and the conclusion of events on the 20th,"" Chertoff said. Federal officials acknowledge the inauguration of the first African-American U.S. president could be an attractive target. Since Obama's election, the number of threats against him has increased, according to a recent federal intelligence assessment. FBI officials say the number of tips coming in has increased, as is common before an inauguration. Investigations, however, have not uncovered a real threat. The FBI has been especially aggressive in examining white supremacy groups, which have ramped up their anti-Obama comments. ""We have not seen any activity by the groups,"" said FBI Assistant Director Joseph Persichini. ""We have seen a lot of chatter, we have seen a lot of discussions, we have seen some information via the Internet. Again, but those are discussions. We look at the vulnerabilities and whether or not the groups are capable of taking on action."" Persichini said he believes the bureau has ""a good operational plan"" for dealing with the groups, but says that right now, there is no evidence they are trying to launch anything.  Watch more on inauguration security » . The Secret Service is coordinating security for the inauguration, which will involve 58 federal, state and local agencies. All of them are represented at the Secret Service command center, where they can communicate and work together to respond to any report of a possible problem. Airspace restrictions around the Capitol are being tightened. The U.S. Coast Guard is closing portions of the Potomac River. Miles of roads will be closed, along with most of the bridges into the District of Columbia. Checkpoints are going up, and undercover teams are being deployed to look for suspicious people or vehicles. Explosives-sniffing dogs will be on hand to nose out bombs, and horses trained in crowd control are on duty. Thousands of security cameras are being used to monitor activities, sharpshooters are being stationed, and sensors will be used to detect chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. In addition to Secret Service agents, the security effort will involve 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions, 10,000 National Guardsmen, about 1,000 FBI personnel, and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard are ready to respond if there is an emergency, according to Chertoff. Security planners have drawn up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect. ""Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage,"" he said. A major unknown is how large the crowd will be for Tuesday's activities. Estimates have ranged from 1 million to 2 million. The FBI's Persichini said only that ""we know it is going to draw a lot of people here to the nation's capital."" Those attending the swearing-in ceremony or entering the parade route will undergo tight screening, including passing through magnetometers. Spectators who are unable to get into those events will be routed to the National Mall, which, for the first time, will be open from end to end for an inauguration. Security there will be less stringent. There has been extensive planning to ensure the crowds can be moved in an orderly and safe way, and to prevent a stampede if there is any kind of security incident. Local and federal agencies have even consulted with a crowd expert. Authorities say the massive security operation is not intended to deter people from coming to Washington. ""Our efforts are to make sure people are safe,"" Secret Service spokesman Malcolm Wiley said. ""We'd like for as many people to come as want to come. And again, during our planning, we have made sure we could accommodate however many people decide to come."" That inaugural events are spread over a four-day period has made security even more challenging. Organizers say they started their security planning the day after the last inauguration and ramped up their efforts in July. Officials involved say this is the biggest event they have been involved in, but believe they are prepared. ""There are a lot of things we all think about, and I'll admit that at 3 in the morning, I might wake up thinking about something, but I have to tell you, I am so confident in this plan,"" the Secret Service's Sullivan said. ""I just don't see any benefit to worry, and I think we just have to go along the way we're going right now and do everything that we can do to make sure that this event is going to be a safe event, that this historical event will be an enjoyable event for everybody and that, quite frankly, that the day isn't about security, but the day is about our president and the day is about our country.""",0.5815494,3570
207,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Corporate lobbyists may have to jockey for attention alongside smaller, grassroots organizations under new ethics rules issued by President-elect Barack Obama's transition team, one analyst says. President-elect Obama's rules will mean nonprofits will have an easier time being heard, an analyst says. Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University professor who teaches lobbyists-in-training, said nonprofit groups are likely to have a stronger voice under the restrictions that  Obama's transition staff issued this week. ""Lobbyists for business will absolutely get meetings with staff for people on the Hill, just like they got meetings before, so their access will not be denied,"" Feldblum said. ""Their positions will be heard, but now they won't be the only ones being heard."" The rules, which transition co-chairman John Podesta announced Tuesday, bar federal lobbyists from contributing to or raising money for the transition effort. Those who leave the transition team will be barred for a year from lobbying the incoming administration on matters related to their transition jobs, and current lobbyists who join the team are barred for 12 months from working in policy fields related to their lobbying work. Podesta called the new policy ""the strictest, the most far-reaching ethics rules of any transition team in history.""

He was a graduate of Canisius High School, John Carroll University and the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. He was a member of the bar in New York and the District of Columbia, according to a biography on CNBC.com . Before joining NBC, Russert served as press secretary for former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and as chief of staff to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Russert joined the network in 1984 and quickly established himself as the face of the network's political coverage, eventually becoming senior vice president and Washington bureau chief of NBC news. His career at NBC was marked by a number of milestones. In 1985, Russert supervised live broadcasts of the ""Today"" show from Rome, Italy, negotiating an appearance by Pope John Paul II -- a first for American television. He was also the recipient of numerous awards for his work, including an Emmy in 2005 for his coverage of the funeral of President Ronald Reagan.

Russert, who also served as a political analyst for cable network MSNBC, took the helm of ""Meet the Press"" in 1991, turning the long-running Sunday-morning interview program into the most-watched show of its kind in the United States. During his 17-year run as the host of ""Meet the Press,"" the longest of any host in the show's 60-year history, Russert earned the respect and admiration of many journalists and politicians. ""He was an institution in both news and politics for more than two decades. Tim was a tough and hardworking newsman. He was always well-informed and thorough in his interviews. And he was as gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it,"" President Bush said Friday. His professionalism earned him many accolades. The Washingtonian Magazine once dubbed Russert the best and most influential journalist in Washington, describing ""Meet the Press"" as ""the most interesting and important hour on television."" In 2008, TIME magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Brokaw described Russert as a political junkie who threw himself into his work during this year's presidential contest.

211,"(CNN) -- On Monday night, CNN's Larry King had an exclusive interview with actor George Clooney, who returned from the strife-torn Darfur region of Sudan and just finished meeting with Vice President Joe Biden. George Clooney, left, talks with Vice President Joe Biden at the White House on Monday. King spoke with the activist actor live from the White House on the humanitarian crisis Clooney says we must confront, along with getting a couple of tidbits about what's next for Clooney's acting career. The following is a partial transcript, edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: We begin with George Clooney, the Oscar-winning actor and activist. He's traveled to Darfur at the refugee camps near the Sudan/Chad border last week and met with Vice President [Joe] Biden today. He's standing, as you see, in front of the White House, where it's 12 degrees. And we thank him for doing this, because he's freezing to death. George Clooney: I should have worn an overcoat tonight. King: You have no coat on? Clooney: No -- and no pants either ... King: Well, you've always been a little strange, George. Anyway, you met with the vice president today about Darfur. What did you tell him? Clooney:  Basically, we were just talking about coming back from Chad, right on the border of Darfur. And we were talking about there's a moment coming up relatively soon, probably by the middle of next week, where the International Criminal Court is going to indict the president of Sudan for war crimes, which has never happened before -- a sitting president. And we talked about this being an opportunity, perhaps, not just for the United States, but all of us together to work with the international community in a real diplomatic effort to try and bring some sort of peace to this region. King: What scale of interest did Biden show? Clooney: Vice President Biden has been incredibly vocal on the issue. We had a long talk about the idea of, first and foremost, appointing a high level, full-time envoy that reports directly to the White House so that it's not just temporary. We need somebody working on this, you know, every day -- getting up every morning with their sole job to find peace in the area. King: What did you see last week? Clooney: It was rough. You know, it's always rough over there. You feel terrible for them. They're hanging on by a thread. We saw an awful lot of fear. There was [also] a tremendous amount of hope. You know, there was a lot of hope that these indictments and this new administration are going to be able to help move the international community toward toward a real peace. King: How do you handle just meeting with these people and seeing this tragedy? Personally, how do you handle it? Clooney: I could tell you a million stories about how it actually affects you personally. But I don't think people should be going there and coming back and saying how it affected them. I think somehow we should all know that these people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth. King: Was your safety in jeopardy? Clooney: Oh, you're talking about the U.N. story. King: Yes. What, they pulled your security, right? Clooney: I was never in jeopardy. I was with journalists who wanted to go into some areas that weren't particularly safe. And we decided that we would go. And that wasn't necessarily part of what the U.N. was looking to do. And so we just went on our own. It was fine. I wanted to say something, also, Larry, which I forgot to say about what I just did today. I delivered 250,000 postcards signed by people all across the country who wanted to help give some political capital to and remind this administration of how important this issue is. It was from the Save Darfur people. But it's from all across the country. And we're probably going to have another 700,000 by the end of the week. King: What specifically, George, do you want Secretary of State Clinton and the administration to do? Clooney: It doesn't appear that the United States is going to send troops in or that the U.N. Is going to send in an army to do this. What it really means is that we're going to need diplomacy. And diplomacy has to start and it has to be aggressive and it has to start soon. We have an opportunity here. King: One other quick thing. Are you going to be in the final presentation of ""E.R. ?"" Clooney: Actually, I'm doing a remake of ""Friends,"" which -- I didn't want to break the news. King: Oh, my gosh. Clooney: I'm going be playing the Jennifer Aniston role. King: I'm thrilled for you, George. Clooney: Thank you. It's a career move. It's a choice. King: Are you going to be in ""E.R.?"" Clooney: I am. I'm in the last episode with Susan Sarandon and Julianna Margulies. So it should be fun. King: Thanks, George. Get out of the cold. Clooney: Thank you. It's good to talk to you.",0.57758486,3379
212,"(CNN) -- Reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on FBI insider W. Mark Felt as a reliable but anonymous source for their stories on the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. Carl Bernstein says ""Deep Throat's"" information on Watergate was ""absolutely invaluable."" Felt, referred to as ""Deep Throat"" in the Washington Post stories and in Woodward and Bernstein's book ""All the President's Men,"" died Thursday in California at 95. He revealed his identity for the first time in 2005. Bernstein never met Felt until this year, but praised his courage during an interview Friday on CNN's ""American Morning."" AM: What are your thoughts on the occasion of Mark Felt's death? Bernstein: I think it's a little emotional, even though he was 95 years old. He was integral to our coverage. He was one of many sources in Watergate who had both the intelligence and the courage to tell the truth. And in his own organization he was one of the few, and he was near the top. What his information enabled us to do was to confirm stories that we had really obtained elsewhere, more than anything else, rather than give us that much primary information. But it was invaluable, and he performed a great act of courage and national service.  Watch a video obituary of W. Mark Felt » . AM: The way that he was portrayed by Hal Holbrook in ""All the President's Men"" was he would give your partner Bob Woodward a little bit of a tease and say, ""I'm not going to tell you anything more than that; you've got to follow the trail."" Was that an accurate portrayal? Bernstein: Yeah. Yeah, that's what we did. But his knowledge gave us a grounding and assurance that we were right in what we were saying and reporting. [He gave us] a certainty in a situation where you had the leader of the free world attacking the press every day, making our conduct -- Woodward's, myself's, the Washington Post's -- the issue in Watergate rather than the conduct of the president and his men. So I think Mark Felt's confirming this information (and occasionally he gave us some important information that we hadn't obtained, toward the end, elsewhere), it was absolutely invaluable. AM: It was always Bob Woodward's intention to keep the identity of Deep Throat secret until the occasion of Mark Felt's death. Bernstein: Well, we both kept it. I knew who he was. The two of us knew. AM: Was it a surprise when it came out in 2005? Bernstein: To both of us. It was a total surprise, even though I'm a contributing editor at Vanity Fair magazine and they disclosed it. They scooped everybody on that one. Yeah, we were surprised. Bob and I went out to San Francisco a few weeks ago; we had a speech out there. And we went to see Mark Felt, and we had a kind of wonderful couple of hours with him. He knew we were coming; he was looking forward to it. But he had been very ill, and it was a kind of closing of the circle, and it was a wonderful experience. AM: Was that the first time you had met him in person. Bernstein: First time I had met him, yes. Bob had met him as a young ensign in the Navy, when he was a messenger at the Pentagon and had renewed the acquaintance. AM: So what did you think of him when you met him? Bernstein: First of all, I was aware that he was 95 years old and in the last stages of his life. But I was amazed at his relative vigor given the fact that he had been quite ill. I was also surprised that there were some moments of clarity, because he had dementia. AM: His family, when the news came out in 2005, declared him to be an American hero. Would you agree? Bernstein: Obviously he is. Look, Watergate was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. And he had the guts to say, ""Wait. The Constitution is more important in this situation than a president of the United States who breaks the law."" It's an important lesson, I think, for the country and for people in our business, as well.",0.5754907,4158

""I'm tall and fairly thin,"" Dean adds. ""He didn't have a moustache. If I shaved and grew a beard like him, I'd probably look a lot like him."" Dean's son, Abraham, looks more like his mother.

""I have the height from my dad, similar to Abraham Lincoln's height -- though not quite there, three inches shorter.""  Watch Abraham Lincoln speak of his iconic namesake » . Kryssia, Abraham's mother, is from El Salvador. ""I loved the name Abraham,"" she says. ""I always did. I think it sounds so elegant and in Spanish, it's 'Aab-ra-haam'. In the Bible, Abraham is the 'father of our faith.' "" ""I never knew I was going to marry a man with the last name 'Lincoln,' never dreamed about it. So when I got married (in 1982) to my husband, Dean Lincoln, and we had our second child, and it was a boy,"" she says, snapping her fingers, ""sure enough, I wanted to name him Abraham. ""We didn't have to argue very much because of course the heritage that he has ... and his great-grandfather's name was Abraham.""  See photos of the Lincolns » . At the Lincolns' home in Everett, Washington, the dining room table is full of genealogy lists, old family photos and letters, some dating back to the Civil War. Dean carefully unfolds one of the letters. It's from William Lincoln, a Union soldier and Dean's great-great-great-grandfather. ""The 'Rebs' are getting just where ol' Sherman wants them,"" William Lincoln wrote home to his wife. ""He will rout them soon and drive them back to their holes."" ""We ain't heard from the election to any certainty yet. But the soldiers think, if Lincoln is elected, we have hopes of the war playing out."" Of his famous name, Abraham says, ""At first, people don't believe me. I usually have to pull out my driver's license. They'll usually crack a few jokes ... sort of breaks the ice."" ""Once in school, a teacher came to my name in roll call. He decided to stop the class and told me to 'make sure I never drive a Ford car.' 'Don't ever let my wife convince me to go to a theater.' ""He asked if I knew John Wilkes Booth. Those are the most common ones. I think he was waiting to get a reaction outta me, but I told him that I'd heard them before."" Word spread quickly through his high school that this freshman wanted to be called ""Mr. Prez."" The nickname stuck. And because of his Hispanic roots, some of his classmates even called him ""El Presidente."" ""I think I've heard every one in the book. I still get a chuckle every time someone thinks they've come up with a new one,"" Abraham says. Abraham grew up in Everett, where, coincidentally, the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is based. When he was 16, the local newspaper asked if he would write a letter to crew members returning from a mission to Iraq. Abraham's letter read, in part: . ""Dear Lincoln crew, . ""My name is Abraham Lincoln. I want to thank you for making me proud to know that the men and women on board the Abraham Lincoln, a ship with the same name as me, are out there fighting as true American heroes."" At first, Abraham had no desire to walk in the shadow of such a great leader. Then, at the University of Washington, he took a political science class. ""There was something about politics that drew me,"" he says. ""I loved the history behind it. That's when I made up my own mind: That was the path I wanted to go."" Abraham spent a semester in Washington, D.C., as an intern for former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts. On his list of places to visit? The Lincoln Memorial and Ford's Theatre. ""The whole atmosphere of that city, knowing someone I was related to, a descendant of mine, had such a huge impact and changed the world as we know it ... And to have a huge memorial dedicated to such a great president."" This past summer, Abraham married Jenae, whom he met as a church youth leader. He says she likes the history behind the name and the attention they receive. Abe is working as a paralegal. He wants to attend law school and -- you guessed it -- pursue a career in public service or politics. ""If anything, President Abraham Lincoln is a great model to follow after. So if you have the name, might as well go down the same path."" Of the similarities between Presidents Lincoln and Obama, Abraham says, ""Lincoln came into office with a nation divided in the Civil War, and Obama is the first African-American president, hoping to transcend party lines dividing America."" Since Abraham's birthday comes eight days after his famous namesake's, the Lincoln family will celebrate President Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday together with their own son's birthday.

214,"(Mental Floss) -- There have been presidential daughters almost as long as there have been presidents. (George Washington had no children.) President Warren Harding made child-care payments to his mistress for years until his death in 1923. What these women did -- both under the influence of and independent from their influential fathers -- make fascinating stories. Here are five you might not have heard: . 1. Sarah Knox Taylor Davis . She packed a lot of drama into her 21 years. The second daughter of future U.S. President Zachary Taylor, Sarah also was the first wife of future Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Her parents gave her the middle name Knox after Fort Knox, in pre-state Indiana, where her military father was stationed and where she was born in 1813 or 1814. Sarah was often called Knox or Knoxie. The life of an army brat was certainly more dangerous in the early 19th century. During Taylor's posting in Louisiana, Sarah and her two sisters came down with ""bilious fever,"" now thought to be malaria. Sarah survived, but her older and younger sisters died. The Taylors were stationed at Fort Crawford (now Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin) in 1832, when Sarah met and fell in love with a young officer named Jefferson Davis. Zachary Taylor opposed the relationship, and accounts vary as to why --because he didn't want his daughter to continue to be exposed to the hardships of army life, or because he and Davis didn't get along. Or both. Davis was transferred, so he and Sarah conducted a long-distance relationship for two years. They even planned their wedding by mail. The ceremony took place in June 1835, in Louisville, Kentucky. Sarah's parents did not attend. Once again there is disagreement over why they were absent. The newlyweds immediately headed south, and they visited Davis's relatives in Louisiana. Sarah, mindful of the family tragedy the last time the Taylors traveled those parts, wrote home, ""Do not make yourself uneasy about me, the country is quite healthy."" But while staying with Davis's oldest sister at ""Locust Grove"" in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, the couple fell ill with malaria. Jefferson Davis recovered, but Sarah died, barely three months into her marriage. Mental Floss: 5 memorable White House weddings . 2. Elizabeth Harrison Walker . Her life straddled the Gilded Age of her father, President Benjamin Harrison, and the Television Age, when accomplished women were just beginning to enter in numbers into the mainstream of public life. Elizabeth was born in 1897, four years after her father left office. A widower with two children by his first wife, Harrison had married Mary Scott Lord Dimmick, and Elizabeth was the couple's only child. She was just 4 when her father, the last of the bearded presidents, passed away. If Elizabeth's dynastic 1921 marriage to James Blaine Walker -- grandnephew of her father's secretary of state and onetime Republican presidential nominee James G. Blaine -- was conventional, much of the rest of her life was not. By the time of her wedding, she had received several academic degrees, including a law degree from New York University Law School, and was admitted to the bar in New York and Indiana at age 22. After her marriage, she began publishing a monthly newsletter, ""Cues on the News."" Geared toward women, it offered economic and investment tips, and was distributed nationally by banks. Her expertise led to appearances on radio and, later, television, where she spoke on economic issues pertaining to women. She died in 1955, at the age of 58. Mental Floss: Quiz: Post--White House lives of presidents . 3. Margaret Woodrow Wilson . Thirty years before the Beatles went to India to sample and popularize its spiritual wonders, another musician and political activist, Margaret Woodrow Wilson, had already been. It was the final chapter in the peripatetic life of the eldest of President Woodrow Wilson's three daughters. Margaret was born in 1886, in Gainesville, Georgia. During her father's presidency, both of Margaret's sisters had White House weddings. So when their mother died in 1914, it fell to the unmarried eldest Wilson sister to become White House hostess. The president's remarriage a year later allowed Margaret to pursue her passion -- music. She studied piano and voice at the Peabody Institute of Music in Baltimore. In 1915, she made her singing debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in Syracuse, New York. During World War I, she gave recitals that benefited the Red Cross and performed at Army camps. In 1918, she began nearly a year's stay in France, singing before Allied troops. The experience led to a breakdown, the loss of her singing voice, and the end of her musical career. Mental Floss: Why do we sing the National Anthem at sporting events? With the war over and women gaining the right to vote, Margaret became an advocate of a style of local participatory democracy in which neighborhood schools would become community centers. The annual $2,500 stipend bequeathed by her father upon his death in 1924 was not enough for her live on, so Margaret entered the advertising business. A speculation in oil stocks went sour, and as the 1920s ended, she ceased being a public figure. In the 1930s she discovered the writings of Sri Aurobindo, a contemporary of Mahatma Gandhi's, whose philosophy for ending foreign rule in India was grounded in yoga and meditation. Eventually she followed her guru east. When a New York Times reporter found Margaret in Aurobindo's ashram in Pondicherry, India, in 1943, she had been living there four years. At the ashram she was known as Dishta. She died there in 1944 at the age of 57 of uremic poisoning. 4. Elizabeth Ann Christian Blaesing . Probably the only advantage to being the child of one of America's worst presidents was not having his last name. Warren G. Harding had no children with his wife, but a married man with two mistresses is bound to leave a legacy. Elizabeth Ann was the daughter of Nan Britton, who as a teenager began a six-year affair with Harding, which lasted until his death in 1923. Elizabeth Ann was conceived on a couch in Harding's Senate office and was born in 1919. On the birth certificate, Britton wrote Christian as the baby's last name. Until his inauguration in 1921, Harding made child-care payments to Britton in person, but always refused to meet Elizabeth Ann. After he entered the White House, Secret Service agents delivered the payments. But when Harding died, the money stopped. In 1927, after Harding's widow refused to continue child support, Britton published The President's Daughter. The tell-all book became a bestseller. As the years passed, the story of Nan Britton and the president's ""love child"" faded, along with memories of Harding's inept presidency. As an infant, Elizabeth Ann was adopted by Britton's sister and brother-in-law for the sake of appearances. As an adult, she married Henry Blaesing. They lived quietly in Glendale, California, and raised three sons. Elizabeth Ann gave one of her first interviews, to The New York Times, in 1964. In it she revealed that her mother was living secretly nearby. Nan Britton died in 1991, ""evidently so forgotten by history that no obituary was published,"" the Los Angeles Times later wrote. Elizabeth Ann died in 2005. 5. Margaret Truman Daniel . The helicopter parent is nothing new. But that pesky parental hovering can whip up a lot of dust when Dad is straight-talking President Harry S Truman. Born in 1924, Margaret was Harry and Bess Truman's only child. Like Margaret Wilson, she began her career as a singer. She was studying history and international relations at George Washington University when her father became vice president in January 1945. Less than three months later, Franklin Roosevelt died and Harry Truman became the 33rd president. After intensive musical training, Margaret made her singing debut in 1947 with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra on a nationally broadcast radio program. She began touring the country, appeared on radio and television, and signed a recording contract. Then came her infamous 1950 concert in Washington, D.C.'s Constitution Hall, in which her father played a role perhaps larger than hers. ""Paul Hume, the music critic of The Washington Post, while praising her personality, said that 'she cannot sing very well,' added that 'she is flat a good deal of the time' and concluded that she had no 'professional finish,' "" The New York Times recalled at the time of Margaret's death last January. ""Incensed, President Truman dispatched a combative note to Mr. Hume, who released it to the press... It said, in part, 'I have just read your lousy review . . . I have never met you, but if I do, you'll need a new nose.'"" (Read the review and President Truman's response here.) The episode didn't seem to impact her career, but her professional singing days were numbered anyway. Margaret would become a radio and television personality, co-hosting the 1950s radio program, ""Weekday,"" with Mike Wallace. She acted in summer stock. And in 1956 she married New York Times editor Clifton Daniel, with whom she had three sons. But Margaret still had other media to conquer. She became a prolific author, writing several non-fiction books, including biographies of her parents. And she penned 13 mystery novels, beginning with ""Murder in the White House.""

215,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Once he roamed the streets, moving from shelter to shelter. Now, Oliver Gomes rubs shoulders with Washington's elite. Oliver Gomes says working in the halls of Congress gave him the motivation and money to get off the streets. Squatting next to a white wall outside a Senate hearing room recently with a cell phone glued to his ear, Gomes is being paid to hold a place in line for a lobbyist at a hearing on the climate-change bill. Gomes -- 6 feet tall, with long curly hair pulled back, wearing a polo shirt and shorts -- is one of the contracted men and women holding places in line for this hearing. Many have been waiting since midnight to ensure their clients a seat. By 9 a.m., more than 100 people are lined up for the hearing. Only 10 seats are available to the public, and the first 10 spots are held by line-standers. The rest are shut out. Though the practice is controversial, Gomes said it has lifted him from life on the street. ""Sitting in the halls of Congress made me feel a little better,"" he said. ""It elevated me and made me feel like, well, you know, maybe I do belong here, maybe I can contribute even at that little minute level.""  Watch Gomes tell his story » . As the need for couriers on Capitol Hill declined with e-mail and fax, courier services like Quick Messenger Service of DC, Inc. have added the service of contracting men and women to hold places in line for lobbyists at hearings. The seats are valuable to lobbyists because the hearing is often their only face time with legislators. For big hearings with limited availability, line-standers may wait 20 to 30 hours. They're paid anywhere from $11 to $35 an hour. Gomes was living in a shelter when he started line-standing. He said working in the halls of Congress gave him the motivation and money he needed to get off the streets. He now makes extra money by recruiting men for the line-standing services from the homeless shelters where he used to stay. ""When I was down and out and I was on the Hill and I had that little bit of hope that while I was actually here, it gave me the incentive to dress a little better, more professional,"" Gomes said. Many of the contracted line-standers are homeless or formerly homeless like Gomes. Williams Howard Johnson Jr., one of Gomes' recruits, found his bright yellow button-down shirt, green patterned tie, and slacks at a donation center because he wanted to dress well for his job. ""That comes from being a part of something that's really meaningful to not only me but to society,"" Johnson said. Johnson was among those who had been in line since midnight for the 10 a.m. climate-change bill hearing, but he said he was happy to be there. ""I'm a part of something today and I'm very happy about that,"" Johnson said. Although Johnson and Gomes are glad to have a job and a feeling of importance on Capitol Hill, many people are opposed to the practice of hiring line-standers. Kalen Pruss, a fellow at the Internet environmental group avaaz.org, and her group of cheering green T-shirted environmentalists were shut out of the hearing. ""It's very unfortunate that the people who come here to line-stand always beat us here cause they can stand here all night,"" Pruss said. John Winslow, director of linestanding.com, said the committees might be creating the lines by limiting the number of seats for the public in the hearing rooms. At this hearing, some of his clients that paid for line-standers to wait at midnight were not able to get into the hearing. ""It's really a question of logistics, how many people does the committee want to service,"" Winslow said. ""And it seems like overwhelmingly they try to limit the number of people who attend these hearings and that just drives up demand artificially."" Critics see the practice as just another way lobbyists are buying influence on Capitol Hill. In 2007, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri introduced legislation to ban the practice of line-standing. ""I have no problem with lobbyists being in hearings, but they shouldn't be able to buy a seat,"" McCaskill said. ""It seems to me that if we are going to make sure lobbyists aren't buying meals for senators, and we are going to make sure lobbyists aren't buying elected officials gifts, then we ought to make sure they aren't buying seating at a public hearing."" Maria Foscarinis, an advocate for the homeless, thinks it's ironic that some of the most powerful people in the country are using some of the most vulnerable to hold a place in line for them. ""They're likely to be standing in line for people who well may be opposed to universal health care that would be a benefit for poor and homeless people,"" Foscarinis said. ""And yet they may be standing there for the purpose of access for the interests that are opposed to their own.""",0.5735403,5231
216,"Editor's note: Ed Rollins, who was political director for President Reagan, is a Republican strategist who was national chairman of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. Ron Silver, seen in a 2006 photo, was an actor with a strong interest in justice and peace, Ed Rollins says. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The lights on Broadway were dimmed Wednesday night to honor Ron Silver, the Tony-award winning actor who was buried Wednesday after a courageous battle against cancer of the esophagus. Ron was a lifelong social liberal and a Democratic activist, but you couldn't narrowly define him. And to those of us privileged to be his friend, he was an extraordinary pal. In the 25 years we were friends, he and I faced off most of that time on opposite sides of the political spectrum. In this era when people want bipartisanship, Ron was the role model. Our earliest encounters began when I was managing Ronald Reagan's campaign and he was a Dukakis supporter. He was passionate and a true intellectual. I have spent much of my life around smart people (fortunately a lot smarter than I) and Ron was one of the smartest. Whatever the topic, he had an opinion on it and probably had just read a book or two on the subject. Ron was a Chinese and international relations scholar and had no casual thoughts, only deep convictions. He backed up his opinions with empirical evidence and could rattle off facts like a baseball statistician. ""Eddie, why do you think that way?"" (Only my mother and wife have called me Eddie.) ""Why would a smart man like you ever come to that conclusion?"" And then we would proceed to discuss the topic for hours. I don't think we ever changed each other's opinions, but after a bottle or two of wine or a bottle of Scotch had been emptied, we still respected each other. We never had a cross word and no discussion ever ended in anger. After a while I learned it wasn't personal and it wasn't because I was Republican. Ron argued with everyone -- even those on his side in an issue -- because he had great curiosity and always wanted to know more. The closest we ever came to harsh words was when I teased him on his Emmy nomination for a recurring role as a slick campaign strategist on the TV show ""The West Wing."" ""You would have won if you asked me how to play the part,"" I declared. ""After all you're just an actor. I am the real thing. I worked in the real West Wing and I managed a real campaign that won 49 states,"" He quickly replied with a big grin: ""Why the hell would I want the input of a guy who lost Minnesota [the only state Reagan lost]? And remember, you only won because you had an actor named Ron making you look good!"" Our discussions often ended in laughter. Because for Ron, politics was serious but it was also fun. I don't think he enjoyed anything more than a great political debate. To Ron, debate was an educational experience. To those of us on the opposite side it was like a combat sport. Several years ago, I was approached by one of the planners for the 2004 Republican Convention in New York. He wanted to know if I could recommend any movie or entertainment stars who would be willing to participate in the convention. Since the passing of the Reagan era, Republicans haven't had a long list of entertainers to choose from. From our discussions, I knew that Ron supported President Bush's battle against Islamic terrorism and the war in Iraq and he had been profoundly affected by 9/11. I asked him would he be willing to participate if asked. He said yes, but emphatically stated he was remaining a Democrat. But he also knew that when he publicly supported Bush on the war, it would affect his long relationships in Hollywood and could cost him future work. Ron's Monday night convention speech was short, less than five minutes and only 429 words in length. It wasn't covered by any of the major networks, but it was still one of the best of the night. When he stated: . ""I am grateful for the chance to speak tonight to express my support for our commander-in-chief, for our brave troops and for the vital cause which they have undertaken,"" his career as a major Hollywood player was over. Even though he had been a president of both the Actor's Equity Guild and the Creative Coalition that he co-founded, he challenged the entertainment industry with these spoken words: . ""Even though I am a well-recognized liberal on many issues confronting our society today, I find it ironic that many human rights advocates and outspoken members of my own entertainment community are often on the front lines to protest repression, for which I applaud them, but they are usually the first ones to oppose any use of force to take care of these horrors that they catalog repeatedly."" Ron was disappointed when he did lose future work and even a few ""so-called Hollywood friends,"" but not surprised. But he said what he believed and never regretted doing it. Ron was always determined to give back something to his country and New York, the city where he, his parents, grandparents and great grandparents were born and loved. Whether he was fighting for the cause of Israel or social justice for the poor or for more funding for the National Endowment for the Arts or AIDS research, he was passionate about his causes. Even though he was close to death, he attended President Obama's inauguration because he thought it was a great day for the country and he didn't want to miss it. And just a few weeks ago while still undergoing chemotherapy, Ron attended the latest board of directors meeting in Washington of The United States Institute of Peace. The Peace Institute is an independent, nonpartisan institution established and funded by Congress whose 12 members are appointed by the president. The organizational goals are to help prevent and resolve violent international conflicts. Ron was appointed in 2007 and was confirmed by the Senate for a four-year term. He told me it was his most important role and a part he was never prouder to play. As the dimming of the lights on Broadway signaled Wednesday night, Ron's voice is now quiet -- and missed. His life's work not only lit up Broadway and filled the big screen, it also inspired others to action. The many roles he played on the stage, in movies and on television pale in comparisons to the real roles he lived in his life. Ron was a great friend, a great father and a great American. We will miss you, my friend. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.",0.57287395,3430
217,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ariel Binns is cute, smart, outgoing and looks remarkably like first daughter Sasha Obama. Young model Ariel Binns, right, resembles Sasha Obama. The similarity has not gone unnoticed by the fashion industry. Harper's Bazaar magazine cast the 6-year-old Brooklyn, New York, first-grader with model Tyra Banks in a photo spread showing an African-American family in the White House. Binns, a child model, was peering out from under a big wooden desk in an image reminiscent of John F. Kennedy's time in office. When it comes to fashion there's nothing like a powerful brand to boost sales, especially if that brand is a dynamic first family. ""Marketers are finally waking up to it -- you know -- black is beautiful,"" says global branding expert David Rogers who predicts African-American models will play a more prominent role in fashion photography as a direct result of the Obamas. ""It's just going to become part of the fabric of the fashion imagery of pop culture, which is a great thing,"" says Rogers.  Watch young first daughter look-alike model » . At Wilhelmina Kids, a modeling agency in New York for kids and teens, agents say there is increased demand for first daughter look-alikes. ""It's a trend because, what little girl doesn't want to emulate the first kids?"" said Marlene Wallach, president of Wilhelmina, which represents Binns. Unlike the Bush twins or Chelsea Clinton, global branding experts say the appeal of the Obama girls is unique -- and infinitely marketable. After the first kids appeared in their J.Crew outfits on Inauguration Day, the company's Web site got so many hits, it crashed. ""The most visible, most exciting family in America is this beautiful black family and so people are ready and looking for those kinds of images,"" says branding expert David Rogers, adding that a lot of Americans want to identify and, ""find some sort of connection with this family."" There is a downside. The Obamas were not happy when toy manufacturer Ty Inc. came out with African-American dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia even though the company said the dolls did not look like the Obama girls. First lady Michelle Obama's office said it was ""inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes."" New York  clinical psychologist Judy Kuriansky says many famous families face similar problems. ""I can certainly understand Michelle Obama being protective of her children. Many celebrities in Hollywood feel that way too. They don't want their children exposed to the public, because once the child is exposed to the public image, not only are they owned, but they could be used in many different ways and it takes away from the child growing up as a normal, average child."" Still, some say the celebrity of Sasha and Malia has a positive effect by presenting a positive and prominent image of young African-American girls. Asked whether she believes the Obama girls will open up possibilities for her own child, Ariel Binns' mom Dawn Crooks says, ""I think it will. I hope it does."" As for the overall effect, branding expert Rogers says he believes using look-alikes will take diversity to a whole new level.",0.5714629,1990
219,"(CNN) -- An Ohio man who was suspended as the drum major of a band for giving President Obama a nod during last week's inaugural parade is calling it quits. John Coleman quit his band after it suspended him for nodding to President Obama last week. John Coleman resigned from the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipes & Drums a week after the parade in Washington. Publicity about his suspension had gotten to be too much, he told CNN affiliate WEWS. ""It's come to a point where I don't want embarrassment anymore between the pipe band and myself,"" Coleman, who is a firefighter, told WEWS on Tuesday. Coleman was seen during the nationally televised January 20 parade nodding toward the new president while marching with the band. A few steps later, he appeared to wave briefly. He told WEWS that as the band was marching past the grandstand where Obama was sitting, he made eye contact with the president. ""Contact was made with our eyes both together and he smiled and waved at the band,"" he told the station. ""And just as a gesture, I nodded my head. I gave him a slight wave and went on.""  Watch parade and explanation » . Representatives from the group did not return calls from CNN. But bandleader Mike Engle told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that Coleman was suspended because he ignored military protocol. ""We had gone over and over time and again with everyone in the band that this was a military parade,"" Engle told the newspaper. ""Protocol and proper decorum had to be followed at all times. Unfortunately, John chose to ignore that."" Coleman had been suspended from the band for six months. In a written statement, band manager Ken Rybka said Coleman's resignation from the group ""comes as a shock and surprise."" The band has been inundated with phone calls, e-mails and messages on its Internet pages -- almost all of them critical -- since the story first broke on Monday, Rybka said. iReport.com: 'Pretty cool thing that he acknowledged the president' ""It is unfortunate that an internal band issue has raised so much discussion and ire from the general public,"" Rybka said in the statement. ""It has disheartened me more than you can imagine."" Rybka said that he will be taking a leave of absence from the band because of the furor. ""The 'afterglow' of participating in the inaugural parade is gone,"" he said.",0.5703396,2195
220,"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Tuesday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says ""having no life"" isn't a requirement for a man to get a job. (CNN) -- How many times have politicians been warned about the dangers of an open microphone? And yet, on Tuesday, the lectern mic at the National Governors Conference picked up this little nugget from Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell. He's having a conversation near the lectern about President-elect Barack Obama's choice for to lead the Homeland Security Department, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano. Here is what Rendell said about Napolitano: . Rendell: Janet's perfect for that job. Because for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19-20 hours a day to it . Wow. Now, I'm sure Gov. Napolitano has many qualifications for the job beyond having no family, and therefore the ability to devote 20 hours a day to the job.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary » . But it is fascinating to me that that is the quality being highlighted here as so perfect. C'mon. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is married with two grown children. His predecessor, Tom Ridge, had a family. Anybody remember a debate about whether they would have trouble balancing the demands of work and family? Now, I am a fan of Gov. Rendell. He has been on this show many times. I like him for his candor. In our attempts to cut through the bull, he delivers far less bull than most politicians. But it is his frankness here that raises so many questions. 1. If a man had been Obama's choice for the job, would having a family or not having a family ever even have been an issue? Would it have ever prompted a comment? Probably not. We all know the assumption tends to be that with a man, there is almost always a wife in the wings managing those family concerns. 2. As a woman, hearing this, it is hard not to wonder if we are counted out for certain jobs, certain opportunities, because we do have a family or because we are in our child-bearing years. Are we? It is a fair question. 3. If you are a childless, single woman with suspicions that you get stuck working holidays, weekends and the more burdensome shifts more often than your colleagues with families, are those suspicions well-founded? Probably so. Is there an assumption that if you're family-free then you have no life? By some, yes. Again Gov. Rendell, I don't mean to rake you over the coals. I know what you meant to say. But your comments do perpetuate stereotypes that put us in boxes, both mothers and single women. In government and beyond, men have been given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to striking the right work-life balance. Women are owed the same consideration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.",0.56760037,1343
221,"Editor's note: Penn Jillette -- the larger, louder half of Penn & Teller -- is a magician, comedian, actor, author and producer. Obama and McCain both promise a government that will watch over us ... ""I don't like that,"" says Penn Jillette. (CNN) -- Everyone I talk to seems to think the president of the United States right now is stupid. The Bush presidency is stupid speeches, stupid high gas prices, stupid bad economy, stupid war on terrorism, stupid war on drugs, stupid hurricane fixing, stupid global warming, stupid war -- stupid, stupid, stupid. They all seem to think we need to get a smarter guy in the White House fast, and Bush is so stupid, that task shouldn't be too hard. Not me. I'd like to say that I believe every president in United States history, including the stupid one we have now, is smarter than me. My alma mater is Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth Clown College, so I'm damning with faint praise, but I'm stupider than this here stupid president. Maybe I'm less stupider than Bush than I'm stupider than Jefferson. But I'm stupider than all the stupid in both of them put together. The idea, especially from the Democrats that I know, is, we just get a smarter guy in the White House, and all the problems will go away. We'll have smart speeches, smart high gas prices, smart bad economy, smart war on terrorism, smart war on drugs, smart hurricanes, smart global warming, smart war in Georgia -- smart, smart, smart. Barack Obama is way smarter than Bush -- so way, way smarter than me. Obama is way more charismatic than me. He did his big speech for about 80,000 people; I'll do my show tonight in Vegas for about 1,000 people. He's more ambitious than I; he's going to be the next president of the United States, and I couldn't even get to week three of ""Dancing with the Stars."" Obama is a great leader. He can fire people up and get them to do what he wants. He does smart speeches that promise everyone everything they need and make us feel good about our country and how much greater our government could be. But I don't think our next president being a great leader is a good thing. I'm worried about someone smarter than Bush taking over that tremendous power. Charisma and ambition increase my fear exponentially, and a great leader scares me to death. We need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the United States can't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore shouldn't try. The only reason John McCain scares me a little less is because I think he's a little less likely to win. They both promise a government that will watch over us, and I don't like that. I don't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me. I may be stupid, but I want a chance to try to be a grown-up and take care of my family. Freedom means the freedom to be stupid, and that's what I want. I don't want anyone to feel my pain or tell me to ask what we can do for our country, or give us all money and take care of us. Gene Healy at the Cato Institute explains that the Founding Fathers wanted the president ""to faithfully execute the laws, defend the country from attack and check Congress with the veto power whenever it exceeded its constitutional bounds."" That sounds like plenty to me. You gotta be smarter than me to do all that, but you don't have to be as smart as Obama, and you sure don't have to be a great leader. Our first seven presidents averaged a bit more than three public speeches a year, and they didn't promise jobs for everyone, day care, dental exams and free stuff. It's really hard to find someone who trusts Americans to take care of themselves and each other without government force. It's hard to find someone running for president who would be content to be what George Washington humbly called the ""chief magistrate."" I think Ron Paul and Bob Barr mean it when they say they want much smaller government. But the government is already big enough, powerful enough and bipartisan enough (and ""bi"" means exactly two and no more) that Ron and/or Bob won't even be in the debates. People won't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves. The choice shouldn't be which lesser of two evils should have the enormous power of our modern presidents. The question should be, who would do less as president? Who would leave us alone? If we could find a lazier, less charismatic, stupider person than me to be president, I'd be all for it. But, it's not going to be easy; stupider than me is rare breed.

223,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Luke Russert, son of journalist Tim Russert, was part of a panel Wednesday that discussed youth voting on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Luke Russert says dinner table political discussions were part of his upbringing. Besides the youth vote, Russert discussed his father's death, his upbringing and his own future in journalism and political commentary. Tim Russert, 58, was the host of NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and one of America's leading political journalists. He died of a heart attack after collapsing at the network's Washington bureau on June 13. The following is an edited version of the show's transcript.  Watch video of the discussion » . Larry King: How did you learn of your dad's passing? Luke Russert: I was in Florence, and I was at an Italian sports bar watching the Italy versus Romania game, and I got a call from my dad's secretary that said he had fainted, and could I get in touch with my mother. Luckily, I was right across the street from the hotel where my mom was. I ran up to her room and said, ""Dad has fainted."" And we kind of learned in increments of what exactly happened. So it was basically about a half-hour after first hearing that he fainted that we actually knew he collapsed and had a heart attack. And at first, I was upset that I was so far away and removed. And I really wanted to be there. But in reality, it was really a blessing to be an ocean away, because it allowed my mother and me to have some real private time to collect our thoughts, to grieve in private, and not be inundated with all the media coverage and all the phone calls. So, you know, it was something that -- it was difficult, but to have that little cocoon, I think my mother and I really used it to our benefit. King: Must have been a long flight back. Russert: It was. It was a long nine-hour flight. But my mother has been so strong through this. And my family has been there for me every step of the way. My girlfriend has been wonderful. So I can't thank everybody enough. And obviously this happened, but it has made it a lot easier to have such good friends at NBC and all through Washington and my family personally. King: Were you brought up talking politics? Russert: I was. It was always something that was always talked around the dinner table with my father and my mother from a very young age. One of my earliest memories is being a young toddler and remembering Ronald Reagan's face on television. My dad was watching a press conference, most likely at that time on CNN. And it was just something that I always grew up around. And we also talked a lot of sports. We talked a lot of culture. But politics was something that I guess has been engrained in me at a very, very young age. King: Did he pick the brains of you and your friends? Russert: He did. We would actually have some fun discussions where I would assume the role of who his guest would be on Sunday and try to answer the questions that he threw at me. And sometimes, if I could answer a question pretty well, he'd say, ""That question's too easy, I've got to get rid of it."" So sometimes, I was a guinea pig for politicians. But it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed doing it. And he would also pick the brains of some of my friends. Some did pretty well, and some didn't. But he was always kind to all of us. King: When did you first vote? Russert: I first voted when I was 18, which would have been 2004. And I registered at the same time I registered for the Selective Service, which I think they do here in the District of Columbia. So I've been a registered voter since 2004, and that's the first time I cast an official ballot. King: How did it feel to vote? Russert: It felt great. It kind of felt like you became a man or at least an adult in some capacity. That your decision -- your decision -- became part of the country and its leadership. And I'll never forget the way I voted was I was in college my freshman year, 2004, so I had to go by absentee ballot. And I was going to meet my father in South Bend, Indiana, for the Notre Dame/Boston College game. And I said, ""Dad, I'd rather you bring the ballot personally so it doesn't have to go through the mail, send it up to me in Boston."" So he brought the ballot, and I filled out my absentee ballot in a South Bend, Indiana, hotel room, and he brought it back and put it right in the FedEx for me. King: We have an e-mail question for you from David in Cary, North Carolina. ""Luke, my condolences,"" it said. ""You've shown great strength and character in recent days. Any chance we'll see you reporting or doing commentary about the 2008 election?"" Russert: Oh yes, you just might. It's something that I'm definitely interested in. I think that I will probably be part of the peacock network. But you never know. I still have the sports show on XM Radio and Carville, and I kind of go into politics. But I wouldn't mind. King: What if CNN made a bid for you? Russert: I'd be your assistant, Larry? King: You got it. You could come to work for us. I think I can speak for management. In fact, they'll probably talk to you tomorrow based on just how well you're handling yourself tonight. Russert: Well, I appreciate it. Everyone has been so kind. I'd love to have the opportunity to come out here and talk about something that is important to me. And it was important to my father, which was young people getting involved. That really is the important issue tonight. Not me. That's important.",0.5651748,749
224,"Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says journalists don't serve the public if they push rumors. (CNN) -- Two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the Internet. One week before comedian Bernie Mac passed away, text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died. I was in New York, and friends and colleagues from Chicago, Illinois, to Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead. The rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead, which was subsequently published by the Chicago Sun-Times. What makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth, and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition. Then there is the ""rumor"" of an affair by former North Carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate John Edwards. The story was broken by the National Enquirer after months of digging. Ultimately, a source came forward and was­ likely paid for the information ­that blew the lid off of the story; the tabloid's editor said ""you can assume"" the Enquirer paid for it. The story exposed Edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened. There has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet wasn't able to verify the story and run with it. The heated discussions even reached the point where Charlotte Observer editor Rick Thames told PBS' ""NewsHour with Jim Lehrer"" that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself, ""When rumor arises, we're going to need to address it. And, unfortunately, we may need to address it before we can determine whether it's true or not because it's having impact, as it was in this case."" Sorry, Rick, I disagree. The most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we don't traffic in rumor and innuendo. None of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control. Running with such rumors has far-reaching implications. Just check out this month's Vanity Fair, where Bryan Burroughs has a great story on the collapse of Bear Stearns. The investment bank's demise, some conclude, was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems, even though it was sitting on $18 billion. The rumors kept going and going­ and when the story hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. In one week, Bear Stearns was no more, and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the Wall Street behemoth. We should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story. The rules are simple: Either you have the facts or you don't. If you do, you run with the story. If you don't, you leave it alone. The National Enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront Edwards as he was leaving the Beverly Hills Hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair. Then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the Enquirer said was the child of the mistress. With other major media outlets turning up the heat, Edwards admitted the affair in an interview with ABC's Bob Woodruff. No media executive should be pulling his or her hair out, trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor. If they had, and the facts didn't support the rumor, then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more. We have an obligation to stick with the facts, and nothing else. And no matter what a blogger, Web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with, the day we choose to alter our standards, our credibility and integrity will be shot. In the end, as former ABC News anchor Max Robinson said in 1988, that's all we've got. Nothing is worth losing that, even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over. Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

225,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Is the United States the ""greatest country on earth""? You hear that a lot, or phrases like that, during this presidential campaign. Candidates may attack other candidates, or the sitting president, but they never attack the idea that America is special, a ""city upon a hill."" ""The last, best hope of Earth."" It's part of America's ideology and its tradition of political rhetoric. To many Americans' ears, it sounds normal. But to citizens of other countries it's sometimes jarring, as if Americans put their country ahead of any other, as if the United States thinks it has the right to tell the rest of the world what to do. We went to the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. and asked visitors if they agree America ""knows best"" and the United States has an obligation to spread its values around the world. Almost everyone we talked with did not agree. Rachel Army, a teacher with a Washington, D.C. non-governmental organization, said: ""I have a lot of pride in our government however, at the same time, it is ours and I don't think that it is right to force it on other people."" Jermane Bonilla, from Los Angeles, said he thinks the United States is a special country, ""the most powerful nation on earth and the most beautiful country on earth, in my mind."" But, he told us ""it might not be the same model that everybody should be using."" They're not the exception, it turns out. In their book, ""America Against the World,"" Pew Research Center President Andrew Kohut and journalist Bruce Stokes say it's more often U.S. leaders who want to impose American values in other countries -- not the American people. The authors analyzed international surveys of people around the globe going back to the 1980's as well as more than 100,000 interviews in 60 countries. Their conclusion? ""Contrary to widespread misconceptions, Americans' pride in their country is not evangelistic. The American people, as opposed to some of their leaders, seek no converts to their ideology."" Citizens of many other countries, too, may think their national way of life is the best but, these authors say, ""they don't dominate the globe."" Americans may not be that different from others but the differences that do exist are magnified, fueling resentment around the world. E-mail to a friend .",0.56439745,7191
226,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The optimism once held by many Americans has been ""beaten out"" of them amid a lagging economy, threat of terrorism and two ongoing wars, according to a professor at Emory University. ""All of those things ... have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be,"" says Patrick Allitt, a British citizen who teaches American history. Allitt recently wrote about what he describes as ""America the miserable"" -- the mood swing he has seen in his 30 years in the U.S. -- for The Spectator, a British magazine. Read the professor's full essay . Allitt spoke with CNN about his perspective. Below is a transcript of that conversation, which has been edited: . CNN: How would you describe the change in America since you first came to America? Allitt: The change is this: I don't get the same sense of intense self confidence as I used to feel when I first came to America, even though that was a period that's usually remembered as a pretty grim time -- the Jimmy Carter years when there was a lot of stagnation and inflation and a general feeling of malaise. Even so, to me, it seemed incredibly energetic here. People in America worked much, much harder than they did in Britain. They seemed more upbeat. They had faith in progress. And there was this feeling of being intensely wide awake for the first time. But now, I think some of that optimism has been beaten out. Counter: Why there's reason for optimism . It's been a very tough 10 years since 2001, hasn't it? The attack on the World Trade Center, the growing fear of terrorism, the difficulty of prevailing in the wars, obviously, more recently the recession. All of those things, collectively, have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be. CNN: Do you attribute it to a change in American mentality or are we exposed to an array of different beliefs through the ever-expanding media landscape? Allitt: It's certainly true there are far more media than there used to be ... that devote a lot of time to people who are dissatisfied. In other words, if somebody's happy, that isn't news. It's certainly news when they become dissatisfied in some way or they have some kind of problem to deal with. In that sense, I suppose there's an inherent bias in favor of bad news. But I think it's more than that. I've spent most of the last 30 years in the company of academics, who also tend to be pessimistic people. They tend to have very high ideals for America. When they see it doesn't live up to its ideals, it makes them disappointed and sometimes embittered. So it may be that, if I spent more time with less educated people, I wouldn't have this sense quite so acutely. I think that's quite possible. CNN: You write: ""The decline of American confidence isn't just a temporary blip on the screen brought on by the recession."" Elaborate on that for me. Allitt: Even before this recession began, I guess it was in October and November 2008 when things really started to go bad. Already by then, I was having a feeling that the general national optimism was less emphatic than it used to be. In the first five or six years of the last decade, there was this feeling that things were going wrong, particularly that the wars were grinding on interminably and that it was very difficult to prevail. It wasn't the same kind of decisive conflict as World War II where you're fighting against a nation-state and you can clearly detect when you're winning. The dispersal of the enemy and the very shadowy character of terrorism tends to be very depressing to confront. You have to maintain a high degree of vigilance and sometimes you have to take comfort in thinking what's extraordinary is what didn't happen; there wasn't another major attack. That doesn't feel like a victory. ... That kind of thing is what I was attentive to when I was writing this story. CNN: If we are in this funk as you describe, is there anything wrong with that? And how do we emerge from it? Allitt: The one thing I've always admired about Americans is their willingness to be self-critical. I do think you could take the view that the very fact that so many Americans are willing to scrutinize their own behavior and their nation's behavior is a sign that they do have these high ideals and they want to live up to them. So in that sense, you can take an optimistic view, even of pessimism -- that sooner or later, the sheer attention to it is going to cause people to recover. But I do think there are generational trends in American life. People who were brought up in the 1930s during the Great Depression -- the image of it stayed with them for a lifetime. ... In the same way, I expect the kids who have grown up in the last few years are also going to carry the marks of this with them through life. They'll come into conflict with their own children who have different generational experiences. It's impossible at this stage to say what's going to happen next. ... But it certainly is true studying the American past, you can see how various traumatic events through the nation's history leave a long-term impression on the people themselves. CNN: You kind of hint about this in your piece: Maybe you're just going through a midlife crisis and that's why you might have this view. Allitt: I think that's possible, but I think I'm describing something more real than that. My job is to study the American people in the past; but also to some extent in the present. I really do feel this kind of change has come about. But you can't quantify it. You can't say 8 out of 10 people are optimistic -- or at least if you try to you're really giving a false sense of definiteness. So what I'm trying to do is capture a mood and compare it to a mood that I saw previously. ... I still feel there's an enormous amount of hope and potential and capability here, so I don't share the feeling of gloom, which I see in the people around me. CNN: Describe the ""Avatar"" analogy for me? Allitt: The plot [of ""Avatar""] is kind of incredibly depressing. The corporation is at the center of this planet. First of all, they have invaded the planet. And now they're sort of stomping on the homeland of the blue people who live there. And really the picture it gives you of America is incredibly depressing. It shows Americans to be greedy and incredibly violent and intolerant, and they haven't got time for this anthropological experiment that's going on. But obviously, the hero is one of the Americans. He's clearly an outsider. ... The main part of the story is a condemnation of America and its values. I was surprised how few reviewers said this picture is a grotesque distortion of what we're really like. CNN: Have you started receiving hate mail yet: Hey, Brit, get the hell out of our country? Allitt: No, not at all. ... It certainly isn't meant to be an attack on America; quite the opposite. As I say, I'm very, very pro-American. CNN: Any final thoughts? Allitt: To me, coming from Britain, one thing that is so inspiring about the United States is people really believe in human equality and they really take it seriously and they try to make it a reality. When I was growing up in Britain, nobody talked about equality. It's a very hierarchical society in Britain, and everyone has their own place within the hierarchy and others are below them -- and then, what you've got to do is stay in your place. So it felt very liberating for me to come to America. Although obviously, this isn't a society where everybody is equal in practice. But at least this is a place where everybody tries hard to make sure that every kid really does have the opportunities to make the most of their own abilities. And that's a great thing. There haven't been many societies in the entire history of the world that have been like that.",0.5620932,9661
227,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sometimes, a T-shirt just doesn't cut it. Allie Tompkins, 19, gets her first tattoo at Fatty's Tattooz on Monday. For those who want a more permanent way to showcase their support for Barack Obama, Washington's tattoo parlors are ready to help. ""There's nothing more memorable than a tattoo,"" said Matt Jessup, better known as ""Fatty,"" the owner of Fatty's Custom Tattooz and Body Piercing. His shop is celebrating what it has dubbed the ""Obamathan,"" where customers can get a free ""Obama '08"" logo tattoo if they buy another tattoo worth $200. The Obama tattoo, Fatty says, is worth $70. ""A lot of people are feeling very inspired and taken by this moment in our nation's history. And for many people, they are in town for this historic event, they want something to remember it by,"" he said. At Fatty's and other tattoo shops in the area, there have been multiple inquiries about getting inked with an Obama image, they say, but only a few people have actually gone through with. The most popular choices so far have been the Obama logo, the word ""hope,"" and the now iconic red-and-blue Obama hope poster by Shepard Fairey. T.J. Mohler, who works at Jinx Proof Tattoos, said business has been up as people flood the city, but only ""about two or three"" customers have gotten an Obama tattoo. One of those people is Mohler himself, who opted for a 5 x 7-inch Obama image on his leg. ""When I look back in 50 years, it will remind me of the time and how excited everyone is,"" Mohler said. None of the shop owners reported any history of George W. Bush tattoos. ""No such thing,"" said Jason Anthony, owner of Midtown Tattoo. Fatty says he's hoping the number of people getting Obama art will grow as more visitors arrive and word about the Obamathon gets out. ""We're still rolling with it through the week, so I'm hoping that we'll get more interest,"" he said. On Wednesday, Fatty has plans to tattoo a portrait of Obama's face on one customer. That piece of art is worth $600, but the customer is getting it for free because she was the winner of one of the shop's promotions. But for those wary of permanent ink, there are some alternatives available. Glam Rock Art is a Washington business specializing in airbrush tattoos and body art. Owner and artist Nicole Graves has ordered custom Obama stencils in response to requests from customers. Fatty's also offers a removable option -- the Obama piercing. It's an orbital ring with a blue bead that costs $44, in honor of the 44th president. And if a customer has a change of heart post-tattoo, Fatty says all is not lost. ""Come on back and I'll cover it up with something else,"" he said.",0.558112,2306
228,"(CNN) -- William Safire, a onetime speechwriter for President Nixon who became a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, has died at age 79, the newspaper announced Sunday. William Safire died in Maryland following a battle with pancreatic cancer, The New York Times reported. Safire joined the Times as a columnist in 1973. In addition to his conservative news columns, which he wrote until 2005, he wrote a language column for the paper's Sunday magazine from 1979 until shortly before his death. He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978. In 2006, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor. Safire had suffered from pancreatic cancer and died Sunday at a hospice in Rockville, Maryland, the newspaper reported. Born in New York in 1929, Safire began his career as a reporter for newspapers, television and radio stations after dropping out of Syracuse University. After becoming a public relations executive in the late 1950s, he was credited with putting together the 1959 ""kitchen debate"" between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at that year's American National Exhibition in Moscow. Safire was the publicist for a builder at the time. ""What I was publicizing was the typical American house,"" he recounted during a conference at George Washington University in July. ""It was my kitchen."" The next year, he went to work for Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential bid. He rejoined the Nixon team in 1968, when the Republican eventually won the White House, and became one of the administration's top speechwriters. Perhaps his best-known line in that job was Vice President Spiro Agnew's denunciation of journalists as ""nattering nabobs of negativism."" But Safire left the administration to join that nattering club in 1973, when he left the Nixon administration to join the Times. His often-pugnacious voice -- he once denounced then-first lady Hillary Clinton as a ""congenital liar"" -- held down the right flank of the Times' op-ed page for more than three decades. He won his Pulitzer in 1978 for columns on the travails surrounding Bert Lance, who as President Carter's budget director in 1977 resigned amid allegations of bank fraud. Lance was acquitted by a federal jury in 1980. And he was an outspoken advocate of the plight of Iraq's Kurdish population. He sharply criticized U.S. support for Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, when Hussein used poison gas to put down a Kurdish revolt, and he strongly supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, writing that ""nobody came out of this war more nobly"" than the Kurds. Safire also wrote four novels, several collections of columns and a political dictionary that was first published in 1968. A new edition came out in 2008. He is survived by his wife, Helene, two children and one grandchild.",0.55768895,6564
229,"Honolulu, Hawaii (CNN) -- U.S. Navy hospital corpsman Francis Nicola received a unique Christmas gift Thursday: a phone call from his commander in chief. President Obama called Nicola, currently deployed in the Arabian Gulf, to extend a personal holiday greeting, according to a Navy spokesman. Nicola has served on the guided-missile frigate USS Rentz for one year. The Rentz is on an extended eight-month deployment, Public Affairs Officer Corey Barker noted in a statement. ""It was a great honor,"" Nicola said. ""The president passed his personal thanks to me and to the crew for our service over the holidays."" Obama ""started the conversation off asking about my wife and my son Anthony,"" he added. ""He then went on to express his thoughts on being deployed away from them during the holiday period and hoped for my safe return to them in the coming months."" The president's decision to call Nicola was the result of a submission by Nicola's commanding officer. ""Petty Officer Nicola's performance has been nothing short of flawless,"" said Cmdr. Jeff Miller, the Rentz's commanding officer. ""He quickly earned my trust [and] confidence."" Nicola said he invited Obama ""for a day of burgers and basketball on the pier in San Diego,"" the Rentz's home port. Obama said he ""would try to take us up on that offer,"" Nicola noted. Nicola, who previously served on the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, is the senior medical representative for over 220 crew members on the Rentz, Barker said. His duties include routine patient care and trauma response. Presidents have traditionally called members of the military during the holiday season. Obama told reporters Thursday that he was planning to call ""a few"" service members this year ""and wish them merry Christmas and to thank them for their extraordinary service.""",0.5563898,7213

From the CNN Center, I'm your host, Carl Azuz. First Up: Focus on: The Economy . AZUZ: First up today: Technically, recession isn't a four-letter word. But it is one that Americans don't like to use, because it describes a downturn in the economy over time. Why might this happen? Well, many Americans' home mortgages are going up. And they're not able to pay. More people are out of work, consumers --like you and me-- are spending less money overall. And we don't even need to mention gas prices. Now these factors add up to an economic forecast that's not so good; Your family may be feeling the pinch. And all this is lighting a fire under government officials to fight a possible recession. Brianna Keilar considers the options Congress has, to try to prevent America from slipping into the red. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN REPORTER: With fears of a recession growing, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was on Capitol Hill Thursday, urging Congress to act quickly on an economic stimulus package. BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: Stimulus that comes too late will not help support economic activity in the near term and it could be actively destabilizing if it comes at a time when growth is already improving. KEILAR: The president had a conference call with Senate and House leaders from both parties, the White House characterizing it as a consultation rather than a negotiation. All sides are indicating partisan bickering will take a backseat to finding a quick solution. Today marks the first time the White House has said President Bush is backing a stimulus plan, but spokesman Tony Fratto shied away from discussing specifics. TONY FRATTO, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECY.: The headwinds that we're dealing with right now are things that we see over the next coming quarters. So we do want to try to pass something quickly. KEILAR: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader John Boehner met for the second day in a row. Both sides are stressing a bipartisan effort, but proposals are still vague. One option Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on: tax rebates: checks sent to taxpayers in an attempt to quickly pump money into the economy. Democrats say they'll scuttle any Republican attempts to extend the president's tax cuts as part of the stimulus package. Privately, congressional Republicans acknowledge it's a fight they can't win. What's more, Bernanke told Congress Thursday, making the tax cuts permanent won't help in the short term. BERNANKE: I think that the evidence suggests that measures that involve putting money in the hands of households and firms that will spend it in the near term will be more effective. KEILAR: Speaker Pelosi is hoping to have a final agreement before the State of the Union on January 28th. Brianna Keilar, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP) No Girls Allowed .

MAZZEO: The school's headmaster says they have no problem with her playing with the boys, but that she isn't allowed by the Florida High School Athletic Association. DON BARFIELD, HEADMASTER OF PROVIDENCE SCHOOL: Since we have a softball team, the state has indicated to us that she would not be permitted to play baseball. MAZZEO: The most obvious difference between softball and baseball -- it's the ball. The softball and the baseball. But Alyssa says there's much more to it than that. PITRE: The pitching is different.

The Spanish anthem doesn't have any words. This man won a nationwide contest with his lyrics for the anthem. But then suddenly the Spanish Olympic Committee, which sponsored the contest, withdrew the winning entry. ALEJANDRO BLANCO, SPANISH OLYMPIC COMMITTEE: Once Spaniards heard these lyrics, they sparked a lot of controversy, even rejection. GOODMAN: Viva Espana, or Long Live Spain, is how the now-discarded lyrics began. The phrase struck a sour note. Critics say it harkened back to the long right-winged dictatorship of Francisco Franco. MARGARITA SAENZ-DIEZ, JOURNALIST: You have to understand that many Spaniards do not consider the national anthem as their own. It was played a lot under Franco. GOODMAN: Spain is now a democracy, but many still bristle at the military march that's served for more than two centuries as the national anthem. Spain is made up of many different peoples, and five languages are spoken across the country. So, naturally, getting agreement on one set of lyrics is no easy task. One of those languages, ancient Basque, is among those taught in Madrid: Basques have their own national anthem and lyrics. At the Basque Cultural Center we found a Spaniard who liked the proposed lyrics for the Spanish national anthem. They're good, he says, and very neutral about Spain. Many others say the proposed lyrics lacked polish and shine. ANTONIO VILLALON, RETIRED CIVIL SERVANT (TRANSLATED): The French and American anthems speak about an enemy to defeat; our lyrics mentioned fields, wheat and friends. It's just stupid. MANUEL RINCON, TAXI DRIVER (TRANSLATED): The anthem should give us goose bumps. Spain's long history and diverse culture should show, in the lyrics. GOODMAN: The Spanish Olympic Committee says the search will go on, but in Beijing, Spanish athletes will likely have to just hum along to a wordless anthem, as they've done for years. It's a tune almost every Spaniard knows. Al Goodman, CNN, Madrid. (END VIDEO CLIP) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, smaller cell phones: Cool. Smaller MP3 players: Cool. Smaller bridges?

Sarah Brown, left, wears a dress from an American designer. Michelle Obama wears J.Crew. Both women later changed and wore other designer outfits for the formal pre-G-20 summit dinner at 10 Downing Street, the British prime minister's official residence. Wednesday morning, Sarah Brown wore a one-of-a-kind navy dress with red lining by the American-born Lintner, a spokeswoman for 10 Downing Street said. The designer specially made the dress in navy for Brown, but retails the garment in black for $720, Lintner said. Michelle Obama's outfit included a $158 green skirt and $298 bead and rhinestone cardigan from J.Crew, the store's Web site showed. Brown also wore a pair of Astley Clarke earrings, according to a spokeswoman from 10 Downing Street. The Astley Clarke Web site sells earrings from less than $100 to more than $10,000. The first ladies' choices of outfits during this summit are being closely watched by the world's media, both in terms of style and comparative cost. Both women pay for all of their clothes themselves and receive no clothing allowance, according to spokeswomen for both sides. Lintner first designed a dress for Brown for the British Fashion Council Awards in November 2007, Lintner said. She sells to clients only through her West London studio and said she started her company out of frustration over the selection of workwear available for women. Although the clothes are expensive, she said, they are made to last. This is not the first time Michelle Obama has chosen an ""off the rack"" outfit. She has worn J.Crew before, including in American Vogue. When appearing on ""The Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno, she wore a J.Crew ensemble, on which she commented, ""You get some good stuff online."" After the photo call, Obama and Brown visited Maggie's Cancer Caring Center, where Brown is a patron. The spouses of the G-20 leaders have several events scheduled during their stay in London. On Tuesday, Brown will be host of a dinner for G-20 spouses. The dinner will take place at No. 11 Downing Street, the London residence of the chancellor of the exchequer, while the G-20 leaders take a working dinner next door at No. 10. As well as the spouses of the G-20 leaders, prominent women in British sport, arts, fashion, charity and business are also expected to attend. Downing Street has said those invited are ""all intended to show off British talent."" Those invited include ""Harry Potter"" author J.K.

235,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A bronze statue of Helen Keller was unveiled at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as lawmakers praised her as a trailblazer and an inspiration for those with disabilities. The Helen Keller statue depicts the moment when Anne Sullivan spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into the child's hand . ""Some are still dismissed and cast aside for nothing more than being less than perfect,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the unveiling ceremony. ""The story of Helen Keller inspires us all."" The statue shows Keller -- who lost her sight and hearing to illness when she was 19 months old -- standing at a water pump as a 7-year-old, a look of recognition on her face as water streams into her hand. It depicts the moment in 1887 when teacher Anne Sullivan spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into one of the child's hands as she held the other under the pump. It's the moment when Keller realized meanings were hidden in the manual alphabet shapes Sullivan had taught her to make with her hands. ""W-A-T-E-R,"" said Alabama Gov. Bob Riley. ""Five simple letters that helped rescue 7-year-old Helen Keller from a world of darkness and a world of silence. ""It is this defining moment that we celebrate today. And in time, this moment so vividly depicted by this statue helped the world to understand that all of us, regardless of any disability, have a mind that can be educated, a hand that can be trained, a life that will have meaning."" Keller learned to speak and earned a degree from Radcliffe College and the women's branch of Harvard University. She traveled the world as an adult, wrote 12 books and championed causes including women's suffrage and workers' rights. Carl Augusto, president and CEO of the American Foundation for the Blind, told the crowd he thinks Keller, who worked for the foundation for the last 44 years of her life, ""would have loved this impressive statue of herself and the symbolism attached."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and others assisted Augusto as he ran his hands over the statue. The foundation, Augusto said, still considers Keller ""our guiding light. She embodies the American spirit of limitless possibility ... her biggest desire was to leave the world a better place than she found it, and ladies and gentlemen, that's the legacy she leaves all of us."" More than 40 of Keller's descendants attended the ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. Students from the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind sang a medley of patriotic songs. The statue, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, will ""always remind us that people must be respected for what they can do rather than judged for what they cannot."" The statue is also the Capitol's first depicting a child, Riley's office said. Since 1864, each state has been allowed to place two statues in the Capitol. In 2002, Congress changed the law to allow states to change their statues. Riley, then a U.S. representative, suggested the state place a statue of Keller, and the state Legislature passed a resolution asking Congress to accept a statue of Keller as a gift. A committee with Alabama first lady Patsy Riley serving as honorary chairwoman raised private donations and selected Utah bronze sculpture artist Edward Hlavka to create the piece. The 600-pound statue is made of bronze with a base of Alabama marble, Riley's office said. In 1997, a Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial that opened near the National Mall drew complaints from disability advocates because the statue of the president, who suffered from polio, did not show him in a wheelchair. In 2001, President Clinton unveiled an addition to the memorial including a new statue of the four-term president sitting in a wheelchair. ""By placing this statue in the Capitol, we appropriately honor this extraordinary American, and will inspire countless children who will come to understand that with faith and with courage, there truly are no limits on what can be accomplished, and there is no obstacle that can't be overcome,"" Riley said. Keller's statue will replace one depicting Jabez Curry. Curry, who has represented Alabama in the Capitol since 1908, was a Georgia native who served as president of Howard College, which later became Samford University in Birmingham. The Curry statue is being sent back to Alabama for display at the university. The other statue representing Alabama is of Joseph ""Fightin' Joe"" Wheeler, a Confederate general during the Civil War who, three decades later, volunteered to serve in the Spanish-American War at age 62 and attained the same rank in the U.S. Army, the only one of 425 Confederate generals to do so, according to a biography of him posted on the Fort Sam Houston Museum's Web site. His statue was donated by the state in 1925, Riley's office said.",0.5382645,7535

See Salzman on American Morning and CNN.com Live Monday, December 29. Marian Salzman says ""cuspers"" are staking out a separate identity from the baby boomer generation. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Rarely has there been a year when so many things went out of style in such a short time: not just investment bankers, gas-guzzling vehicles, corporate jets, conspicuous consumption and political polarization, but also a whole generation. After strutting and tub-thumping and preening their way across the high ground of politics, media, culture and finance for 30 years, baby boomers have gone from top dogs to scapegoats in barely a year. As baby boomers lose their authority and appeal, generational power is shifting one notch down: to cuspers (born roughly 1954-1965), who arrived in style in 2008 with their first truly major figure, Barack Obama (born 1961). George W. Bush, born in 1946 at the start of the postwar baby boom for which his generation is named, will leave office with the lowest approval ratings since Richard Nixon was president. As Thomas Friedman has written, Bush epitomizes what's now seen as ""The Greediest Generation."" Who's to blame for the economy going into serious decline? The short and easy answer is greedy boomers. This is the generation that knew better than their cautious, fuddy-duddy parents, the generation that protested, that had ideals and marched to the beat of defiant music: ""Street Fighting Man,"" ""We Want the World and We Want It Now,"" ""Hope I Die Before I Get Old."" It's the generation that pursued pleasure, proclaimed ""I can have it all"" and refused to grow old -- ""50 is the new 30,"" etc. And now, after years of taking credit for changing the world, baby boomers are taking the rap for the reversal of fortune that's shaking the world. Whatever history may decide, today's commentators and pundits of all ages have decided that boomers, the dominant cohort in many developed countries, are guilty. And whether they're really to blame, what counts is that they look like they are. Their profile fits. Like a big-name Hollywood director who's lived on the edge too long, caused one too many scandals and made one too many turkeys, suddenly the boomers are the generation no one wants to be associated with. Cuspers, the age cohort that have been living in the shadow of the boomers, now have even more reasons to stake out their own separate identity and values. It's taken a long time for this rising demographic to be recognized as a distinct generation in its own right. They've been called ""late boomers"" because they missed the formative boomer experiences of the '60s, such as civil rights and anti-war protests. They've been called tweeners or cuspers because they straddle the divide between Boomers and Gen X. American social commentator Jonathan Pontell has worked hard to establish their identity as Generation Jones. There's still debate about whether cuspers are even a generation apart from boomers and where the generational boundaries lie. But those arguments miss the key point, which is that Americans want change. In Obama, they see the hopeful prospect of a new generation taking over. And in these dark days, they're hoping against hope that his generation can usher in new, better values to guide the nation. His victory has been portrayed as the end of Vietnam War politics and the 1960s ""culture wars."" About half those Obama named to major posts in the new administration are also cuspers including the proposed energy czar, education secretary, treasury secretary and U.N. ambassador. Cuspers may have another poster child if Caroline Kennedy, born in 1957, is named to the New York Senate seat that Hillary Clinton is expected to vacate. Obama himself has made clear he thinks in terms of generational difference. He has spoken of carrying on the work of the ""Moses generation"" -- the Martin Luther King Jr. generation --  whose successors he has referred to as the ""Joshua generation."" His activists rallied under the banner of Generation Obama, and his campaign's ability to mobilize the youth vote proved decisive in his victory. Whether we call them cuspers, Generation Jones or Generation Obama, there are enigmas and paradoxes within this generation and its fans. They respond to Biblical imagery, but they're not dogmatic in their faith. They value traditional notions of family but see men and women as equals in parenting. They go back to older American values -- civility, community, responsibility -- yet keenly embrace technology and use the Internet naturally. In fact, embracing digital technology is one of the telling dividers between boomers and cuspers. It's no coincidence that leading-edge Cuspers such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Tim-Berners Lee, all born in 1955, helped create the digital universe cuspers and younger generations now inhabit as a matter of course. It's also telling that Gates and wife, Melinda, another cusper, are the parents of philanthro-capitalism. For marketers and brand specialists, cuspers are a fast-emerging challenger brand that's fascinating to watch as it defines itself and attracts fans. Brand attributes once seen as disadvantages -- living in the shadow of boomers, a lack of major formative experiences, no ""heroic"" narrative -- have turned out to be advantages as the boomer brand loses its sheen. The cusper brand can define itself by what it's not: greedy, selfish, confrontational, hung up on past battles. The cusper generation is as much an ideal as it is a demographic group, and that appeal extends well beyond the birth years that define it. Watch out for tweets (messages on the Twitter platform) that proclaim ""Ich bin ein cusper."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marian Salzman.",0.53557366,6864

238,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- What do you say when you meet one of the most iconic statesmen in the world? Mandela holds baby Freya as Robyn Curnow and her husband Kim look on. For someone who makes a living out of communications, I have consistently been tongue-tied around Nelson Mandela. The funny thing is I am not particularly star-struck -- as a CNN correspondent I get to interview and profile all sorts of ""famous"" people. It's just a not a big deal for me. However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day. As a South African he has a place in our hearts that is hard to define. However, my stories about my encounters with Nelson Mandela are the stuff of comedy clubs. I've never quite managed to hold my own with him. I always land up somehow embarrassing myself when I am around him; I've slipped on shiny presidential floors, got tangled up in camera equipment and made pathetically inane comments. I first met Nelson Mandela in the early 1990s. I can't remember exactly when, but it was at the Wanderers cricket stadium in Johannesburg. He visited the VIP room, during a test match, where I was working during school vacations and everybody lined up to meet him. I stood proudly and waited my turn, he came over to me. He was tall. He said to me, ""You are so gracious, I am so humbled to meet you."" I remember thinking, if Nelson Mandela thinks I am gracious -- fantastic. I promptly turned around and ungraciously tripped on my best shoes, tumbling into the crowd behind me. I was the one humbled. Years later, I was a young reporter working for the South African Broadcasting Corporation during Mandela's presidency. I wasn't senior enough to cover the big political stories of the day so news editors only assigned me the light hearted Mandela news stories. The one I remember most was around a birthday or Christmas during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson's kindergartens. Word had got out among the press that ""Twinkle twinkle little star"" was Madiba's favorite nursery rhyme, so, of course, all the children sang it for him. I sang along too, twinkle-finger actions included, it's a great song. Whether it was or not Madiba's favorite, is not something I have ever asked him. Years after that, I was taking a sabbatical from journalism and spent a year studying for my Masters degree at Cambridge University. Mandela just happened to be an honorary fellow at Magdalene College, where I was studying. He came to visit that year, giving a speech in the college's beautiful cloisters. I waved at him, as he passed by all of us students assembled in the quadrangle. Of course, he didn't wave back, but I felt gracious and humbled in his presence, protected by Magdalene's great walls. And then I turned to my awe-struck friends and said, ""Did you know his favorite song is 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?'"" -- which kind of killed the moment. Fast forward a few more years, I reported on Mandela occasionally during my time as a correspondent at CNN London's bureau. From a distance, I saw him get older and shakier on his feet. His hair got whiter and his public engagements lessened considerably. Once in while, I would regale my friends with Madiba's stories -- yes, there are more -- like the time I sneaked into the bathroom in his presidential mansion, desperate for relief, before a long-delayed press conference and phoned a friend from within to ask whether it was morally right to steal some of Nelson Mandela's soap. ( I didn't. It isn't very gracious). Or the time, I asked Zelda la Grange, his devoted personal assistant, to take a photo of me and Madiba together before I went up to Cambridge. He agreed and came over to me, throwing his arm around me and giving me squeeze a and joking, ""Ah, I am sure your boyfriend will be jealous."" Did you know that Nelson Mandela is a terrible flirt? Again, I became self-conscious. I was carrying my handbag over my shoulder and I didn't want the photo to look like I was Margaret Thatcher or my grandmother, for that matter, constantly clutching a handbag. So with his arm still firm around my middle, I bent down to put my handbag on the floor. That's when Zelda took the photo... unfortunately; the automatic flash went off on my camera. That's a complete no-no around Mandela -- his eyes were damaged during his years of imprisonment on Robben Island and flash photography is forbidden. So they whizzed away, slightly peeved, and I landed up with a ""Me and Mandela"" photograph that showed the president grinning into camera, holding me around the waist and me half bent over, lowering my handbag, with my head half cocked and eyes half closed. It was not mantelpiece material. I never thought I'd meet him again, up close and personal, until, last year when Zelda, ever the diplomat, like her boss, invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter, Freya, to him. My husband Kim and I had just returned back to live in South Africa, after nearly six years away in London. It was oddly nerve-racking, and I did what I always do in his presence I acted incredibly gauche, stupid and clumsy. I kept on saying: ""So how are you?"" As if he'd offer me a glass of wine, and say, ""Ya know Robyn, my knees are killing me, I'm bit worried about the situation in Zimbabwe and howz about them Mets?"" I offered my baby to him, like a little sacrificial lamb. The pictures tell it all. The ones we sent to friends (and everybody we knew), show us laughing with the world's greatest statesman. The ones we didn't email to the world show our daughter freaking out and crying. Madiba tried to placate her by wagging a finger at her and telling her, ""I am your great great grandfather."" She freaked out some more. I think she takes after her mother.",0.53462845,7042

She is a graduate of Biola University and the Torrey Honors Institute. Rachel Motte says Rush Limbaugh still can animate conservative popular opinion. (CNN) -- It's no secret that liberals throughout the nation are rejoicing at Rush Limbaugh's supposed status as leader of the Republican Party. I can see why. He's easy to pick on. His rhetoric is extreme, and his personal life has at times been less than picture-perfect. I've heard some pundits refer to Vice President Joe Biden as ""the gift that keeps on giving."" I imagine the left feels the same way about Limbaugh. Rush was an integral part of my childhood. I must have been 6 or 7 when I started listening in the late 1980s. I remember that my parents and their friends found him refreshing, and I remember that he made them laugh. I memorized his song parodies and even tried to write a few of my own based on the events I heard him talk about. When I was 11, I once spent several hours trying to call his show, redialing after every busy signal, over and over. I never got through. It's probably just as well; I think I had planned to try to talk him into running for president. I no longer think he'd make a good president -- we're all much better off when he sits behind the EIB microphone. Rush taught me a lot about personal responsibility, the value of freedom of speech and the love of country. At 26, I've outgrown many of my childhood habits, but I never outgrew Rush. Have conservatives outgrown him? Is it time to distance ourselves by dismissing him as just ""an entertainer,"" as Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele initially did before apologizing? My friend John Mark Reynolds wrote recently that Rush is ""a shallow thinker"" who will alienate today's young adults rather than draw them in. He argued that Rush's ""insider lingo"" and harsh demeanor are problematic at a time when the Republican Party is losing the young adult vote. Is he right? Has Rush Limbaugh outlived his usefulness to the conservative movement? Should we take a cue from the Democrats' glee and relegate El Rushbo to a back room like an aging and unpopular distant relative? Not by a long shot. Rush doesn't need to be removed as leader of the Republican Party, because he's never held that position, much as Democrats would like you to think he has. He's a vitally necessary part of the conservative movement, but he's no one's leader. Don't give him more credit than he deserves, and don't fall prey to the Democrats' carefully planned attempts to inflate his authority. Steele learned the hard way a few days ago that the opposite extreme is also not true -- Rush is not a mere entertainer. One of his most important contributions to the conservative movement has been his ability to energize the base. This is particularly vital now given the recent election results. Someone has to keep the troops from giving up, and like it or not, for now that someone is Rush. It doesn't really matter whether he's a shallow thinker. What does matter is that he knows how to prod people into action. That's all well and good, but is it sustainable? What works for me and for the many other ""Rush babies"" out there may not work for our younger siblings. Thanks to the Obama campaign, new activists aren't going to be as easily attracted by witty aphorisms and wordplays as previous demographics were. President Obama's impressive rhetorical skills appeared to raise the level of public discourse during the campaign. As far as I can tell he didn't actually say anything new, but so many things sounded new when he said them. I don't think he changed the content of the age-old feud between right and left, but he did change the style, providing a stark contrast to the admittedly strident tones of some on the right. That's going to change the way young people all over will approach the political process; after all, 66 percent of the 29-and-under crowd voted for Obama. Rush's personal influence will decline because of this shift in rhetorical style, but we're not yet at the point where it is unimportant. The current crop of college students may not call themselves ""dittoheads,"" but their mentors and heroes within the movement still do, and that will continue to be significant for a while yet. Do we need leaders who can inspire the next generation of young conservatives? Absolutely. Is Rush the best man for that job? At this point, yes, though that will probably change in the next few years. One thing is likely -- the next big conservative leaders who do resonate well with the age group that favors Obama will cite Rush as a major influence. His work won't end with him. And that's as it should be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rachel Motte.",0.5319948,2033
240,"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Pier Silvio Berlusconi, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's eldest son and a top official in his media empire, says his father was ""always there for me."" Pier Silvio Berlusconi,  vice president of the Mediaset group, in Cologno Monzese, Italy in March, 2009. Berlusconi, 40, is vice chairman of Mediaset SpA, the Italian commercial television network founded by his father and now owned by the Berlusconi family through the holding company, Fininvest. He's held several positions at the company since joining in 1992, at the age of 23, following a serious motorcycle accident. He started in the marketing department of Publitalia, the company's advertising group. Four years later, he was appointed director of scheduling and program coordination for Mediaset's three channels. In an interview with CNN's Hada Messia, the younger Berlusconi says his father, Italy's longest-serving prime minister, was ""always a very present father"" even though there were periods he saw him more and times he saw him less.

""I never felt like something, or even more the father figure, was missing,"" he said. The younger Berlusconi, the prime minister's second child, says he grew up in a ""totally normal family ... at least until my father began to go into work in politics. It was a normal family, a healthy family."" Asked what makes a normal Italian family, the younger Berlusconi replied: ""A normal Italian family is where certain values are always very present. Some of these values are connected to being a family. Being closer to each other and respecting certain traditions, being there for one another."" Pier Silvio and Marina Berlusconi, the prime minister's oldest child and also a top official in his media empire, the billionaire entrepreneur's children with first wife, Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio. The couple divorced in 1985 and Berlusconi went on to marry actress Veronica Lario, with whom he had three more children. In May of this year, Lario announced she was filing for divorce after the Italian press reported the prime minister attended the birthday party of an 18-year-old Neapolitan model. Asked what he learned from his father, Pier Silvio Berlusconi said that as a young boy, his father taught him normal father-son things like ""how to swim"" and play tennis. The most important thing he taught him in life though, he told CNN, was ""respect for other people. I am impressed by how much respect he always has for the other person."" The younger Berlusconi said he got into his father's business by accident in 1992 after suffering a terrible motorbike accident. ""I had a very bad motorbike accident when I was 20 years old,"" Pier Silvio Berlusconi told CNN. ""I couldn't walk for one year. After that, I decided I wanted to do something more than just being in college."" He then joined Mediaset, which was not listed on the stock market at the time. Berlusconi says when his father decided to go into politics in 1994 -- something the elder Berlusconi says he did to stop the advance of the Left in Italy -- ""he totally disappeared."" ""In Mediaset, in our company, he was very very present and operative before and he stopped being here. He stopped existing basically,"" Berlusconi said. ""From there on, my job was a continuous revolution and I started looking into things I never thought I would have. In three or four years, I found myself completely into the veins of the company and having important responsibility."" He said his father ""never even knew exactly what I was doing or what my work was. I know this can sound strange, but it is the way things went."" Pier Silvio Berlusconi says he has no plans to follow his father into the political arena, however, saying politics is not something you can learn. ""You have it or you don't have it,"" he said. Asked to describe his flamboyant father in a few words, Pier Silvio Berlusconi replied: ""Positive energy."" ""He's like a battery,"" he said, ""full of energy always, always positive, towards people, towards things he has to do, towards problems which he always tries to do everything he can to resolve."" ""He is really unique in as far as how much passion and devotion he puts into what he does,"" his son told CNN. ""He did a lot as a businessman and now as a politician.""
