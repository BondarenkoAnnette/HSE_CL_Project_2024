0,"(CNN) -- Amber Easton has gone from $80,000 a year in salary to scrambling for work. At a time in her life when she should be scaling the corporate ladder, she has instead spiraled into a deep depression. She recently lost her car and now faces eviction from her apartment. Job fairs have been on the rise amid the nation's hard economic times. Just last week, the 35-year-old longtime working professional attended two job fairs with friends in the Detroit area. They stood in line for over three hours with hundreds of professionals of all types. ""It was a real eye-opener to see the caliber of people we were in line with -- very educated with vast skill sets,"" Easton said in an e-mail. ""Afterwards, we went to the restaurant located in the same hotel and it was filled with unemployed professionals sharing their story, from engineers to graphic designers to marketing professionals."" Easton's saga began in July 2007 when she traded in her job as a corporate compliance officer to attend law school, what she thought would help advance her career. But after a year of law school, she decided it wasn't for her. By then, her old job was gone and the job market had shrunk. ""It's hard not to be depressed during a time like this,"" she wrote iReport.com. ""I never imagined in a million years that I would be in such a situation at my age and at this point in my career. I am humiliated. I am praying for everyone else out there is who are facing the same problems."" She has applied to 70 different companies but gotten few leads. She recently went through a rigorous interview process for one job in another state, but to no avail. Share your economic survivor story . Every day, she searches for new job possibilities and every day results in more desperation. She estimates she's making $20,000 -- ""if that"" -- as a contract employee working from her home. ""I just haven't made enough to keep up."" Her Detroit neighborhood a couple years ago was booming, she said, but now ""it's like a ghost town around here."" ""It's bad everywhere, but it's so, so bad here,"" she said. Across the nation, people like Easton are feeling the pinch. Good jobs have evaporated. Former full-time employees are now working part-time contract positions just to get by. Nearly 2.6 million jobs were lost during 2008, the highest yearly total since the end of World War II in 1945. This week alone, major corporations have announced more than 80,000 job cuts, bringing this year's total to well over 200,000. Dr. Rosalind Dorlen is a clinical psychologist in Summit, New Jersey, an area she calls a ""Wall Street ghetto"" where formerly high-flying executives are out of work. ""Here, the people earn millions of dollars with bonuses that are astronomical,"" said Dorlen, who is also the public education coordinator in New Jersey for the American Psychological Association. ""There is a demoralizing aspect to having a huge salary and a huge bonus and then having to look for a job that is going to pay much, much less."" She added, ""What I'm hearing is a terrible sense of betrayal, anxiety and people experiencing lots of stress."" That, in turn, can lead to an increase in unhealthy coping behaviors, such as an uptick in alcohol consumption, unhealthy eating and worse sleeping habits. Dorlen has several tips for people out of work: . • Don't panic; . • Find a support group, even if it's just an informal group of friends; . • Seek employment counseling when available; . • Be professional in your job hunt; . • Network with other professionals; . • Take time to exercise during hard times; . • Spend valuable time with your family. On a practical note, she said people should contact their creditors to let them know the situation. She also advises people to do volunteer work and to cultivate a ""spirit of optimism."" ""Bad times pass, and it's sometimes hard to see that when you're in the throes of a terrible place,"" she said. ""I think we do need to hold onto a spirit of optimism and a sense of confidence."" See Top companies: They're hiring! ""I think we're getting mired in the gloom and doom, and we need to hold on to the fact that lots of people are working.""

In Delaware, Manoj Philip, 24, said he had a full-time job in 2007 with Agilent Technologies making about $55,000 a year, including all the perks and benefits that came with it. But in July 2007, he quit that job to pursue a career in real estate. ""I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I didn't think it would be this tough,"" he said. By September 2008, Philip needed a second income because of the withering housing market. He picked up a full-time contracting job and continues to do real estate about 20-30 hours per week. It was a shock, he said, to return to full-time work while putting his real estate dreams on hold. ""It took a lot for me to change that mental outlook. Because before I would've thought of it as something holding me back,"" Philip said. ""But I don't look at it like that anymore."" He's since learned the value of living within his means, budgeting and making every dollar he spends count for something. ""These are really important lessons to learn. I'm glad I learned it at such a young age."" In Detroit, Easton said she knows America will bounce back at some point, but ""in the meantime, people are losing everything."" ""That's what scares me,"" she said.",0.83331263,3371
1,"Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, Bob Crowley reports from Boston, Massachusetts. Hardware store owner Brendan Kenney says ""people who have money should go out and spend it."" BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Brendan Kenney has seen enough bad news about the economy. ""I'm also getting tired of being worried,"" he says. His family has been running a small hardware store in Brookline, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, for about 56 years. He says business has slowed down a little, but mostly because winter is normally the slow time of year for them. Though he hopes the stimulus plan will help his and other small businesses, he believes people shouldn't be afraid. ""I think the American consumer holds a lot of power,"" he continues. ""I think people who have money should go out and spend it."" Like many in the Boston area, Kenney doesn't want to hear more discouraging stories and sees that as part of the problem. ""It's just negative story after negative story, kind of creating a crisis of confidence.""  Watch Boston-area reaction to the economic slump » . South of Boston, Jose Nieto, from Plainville, has his own reasons to be discouraged. Between September and October of last year, he was laid off twice. Nieto, a civil engineer who works on road construction projects, had felt fortunate. After losing his job of 14 years, he was able to find employment after only being out of work for two weeks. After being on the new job for three weeks, however, he got called into the boss's office. ""I said, 'Oh, no. My God, not again.'"" He was faced with looking for work in an industry that traditionally slows down in the winter months. ""It's more than losing your job. It gives you a feeling of rejection,"" he says. Yet, Nieto feels this is a time to learn valuable lessons, especially for those who need to dip into their savings when unemployment checks don't cover all of the bills. ""I think a lot of people will learn from this situation, and, going forward, they'll try to save more money."" He has been trying to stay healthy, busy and positive. Passing the time working on projects in his basement workshop and taking yoga classes has helped him get through the rough spots, and his luck is turning. He was offered a job that starts in March. ""It is a relief, because I'm employed,"" he says, ""however, I'm taking a job for much less money."" Nieto believes that most employers cannot afford to hire at the salaries they could offer in the past. Like Kenney's hardware store, Sue Stein's American craft gallery, also in Brookline, is not seeing any major shifts in her business, yet. ""Our business has been certainly down, but not devastating,"" she says. Fire Opal, her gallery, sells everything from earrings to pottery to scarves, all made by artists from around the country. To keep her business healthy, she says, she is trying to make adjustments like buying less merchandise. But she is changing her approach to her customers as well. She says she tries to keep ""understanding that people are having a hard time and trying to find things that are more in their price range."" Like Kenney and Nieto, Stein is also trying to stay optimistic. ""I think if we all are very careful,"" she says, ""we'll sort of ride it out and then things will adjust.""",0.8056021,1817
2,"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on issues affecting communities across the country. County administrator Brenda T. Buck is trying hard to help create eight to 10 sawmill jobs for Jefferson County. FAYETTE, Mississippi (CNN) -- The odds are against Brenda T. Buck, and she knows it. So she counts on what she calls the Sandwich Philosophy: ""Take it one bite at a time."" Buck is the county administrator in Jefferson County, a rural area in southwest Mississippi dotted with small churches, modest homes and markers noting a Civil War skirmish. ""It is a great small town, and everybody knows everybody,"" Buck says. If you look through the statistics, three things jump out: . • The Census Bureau lists the population of Jefferson County as 86 percent African American, the highest percentage of any county in the United States. • It is the fourth-poorest county in the United States, with a median income of $15,037. • The unemployment rate in August was 18.6 percent, the highest of Mississippi's 82 counties. ""It has not always been this way,"" says Angelia Shelvy, a single mother of three who is among the unemployed. ""I think we are forgotten."" Shelvy had a job making $10,000 a year as a teacher's assistant, but she left it to take a job paying twice as much, signing on with a union that provides workers to nuclear power plants. Her parents agreed to care for her children when she had to travel, for months at a time, as far away as Arizona. Shelvy thought it was the right thing to do for her family, but phone calls to home at bedtime proved otherwise. Her 4-year-old, especially, had a rough time adjusting. ""I'm like, 'You have Granny.' He's like, 'No, I don't want Granny; I want you to hold me,' "" Shelvy told us. ""I missed Mother's Day twice; for two years I missed it. ... So I decided that it was more important for me to be here with my children."" Back home now, she has been searching for work since March, looking as far as 90 minutes away from Fayette. ""I did Internet searching, different jobs, hospitals, different schools,"" she said. ""They're not hiring. They either say they are not hiring, or I'm not qualified. I don't have enough years of experience. 'We'll call you later.' 'Get back with us.' And it's been stressful for me."" Buck spends hours a day trying to help, and most of her time with the Board of Supervisors is spent debating economic development ideas. At home, too, she is reminded of the bleak local jobs market. Her husband isn't there. He's working 900 miles away, at the moment, in Indiana. ""He works with a company that has been going into a lot of the car plants"" during refittings and downsizing, Buck said. ""We have four kids. ... He is here basically maybe a total combination of, maybe, two months out of the year."" The county got a modest amount of federal money to buy new police cruisers. But its requests for stimulus money to improve its roads have been ignored, at least to date, and as Buck continues to press those requests, she also is pushing smaller economic development grants. Reliable Mat LLC is her current obsession. The screeching hum of a giant saw greets visitors, and inside the warehouse are dozens of pallets of neatly stacked firewood, waiting to be loaded on 18-wheelers and distributed across the country for the coming winter. On the grounds, there are 10 workers, some running giant logs through the saw, others stacking and wrapping the wood for shipment. On average, the men make about $100 day, and Paul Southerland, the company's general manager, says the noise and activity attracts others who are down on their luck. ""I see a lot of people come by looking for jobs, yeah,"" Southerland says during a tour of the grounds. The company's main product is giant wooden mats used to create flat surfaces to provide access -- on foot and in vehicles -- to oil and gas fields. All of the work has shifted to the firewood production because orders for the mats have dropped dramatically. ""Mississippi is always last to feel the effects of a recession, and most of the time it is the last to pick back up,"" Southerland said. ""It hit us about June. .. It really hit us hard, too."" Still, Southerland expects orders to pick up early next year. He hopes to expand the business by then if the county secures an economic development grant to help him buy a bigger sawmill. ""If we had that sawmill, we would be able to add eight or 10 more folks,"" Southerland said. Eight or 10 more jobs might not seem like much in many places. But Jefferson County's population is just shy of 9,000, and when nearly one in five are unemployed, Buck invokes her Sandwich Philosophy. ""My short term goal is to get that grant, to get those eight people working,"" she says. ""My philosophy, when I walk through the doors in the morning, just like a sandwich: take one bite at a time."" She also sees a bigger gain than just eight or 10 jobs. ""Just imagine, eight people, if it were eight men making $10 to $11 an hour could actually come home and be home at night with their families,"" she said. ""The impact that it would make not just from the economical standpoint but from the social standpoint. ""That father's presence there in that household and not having to travel so far. I mean you have a double whammy. It's a win-win for any family.""",0.7934911,6437
3,"AURORA, Colorado (CNN) -- In her best year as a mortgage broker, Laura Glick says she made ""six figures."" This week she was one of more than 1,200 people attending a job fair and applying for one of 150 jobs paying between $7 and $12 an hour at a new Kohl's department store in a Denver, Colorado, suburb. Laura Glick says she has a good resume but even getting an interview is difficult. She has been out of work for seven months and never thought it would take her this long to find a job. It's not the kind of job she thought she would be applying for, but she has a case of the jitters just the same. ""Your heart starts to race, and you get nervous even though it is not some big job like you used to have,"" she said. ""I'll take anything at this point."" Glick is not alone. Many other people have lost their jobs in this tough economy. A record number of jobless claims was set last month, when first-time claims hit a 26-year high of 589,000 claims in one week. Last week's claims also broke the half-million mark, 524,000, according to a new government report cited on CNNMoney.com. Glick, 29, has been living on about $1400 a month in unemployment benefits, barely enough to cover her rent and health insurance. To get by she has stopped eating out, given up cigarettes and has stopped taking her pets to the vet for regular checkups. ""Its feels very degrading, some of the places I'm applying,"" Glick said. ""It's really difficult, and its hard to stay positive, but that's the only way you're going to get something is staying positive. And I'm hoping everything happens for a reason and the doors that have been closed are going to be the ones that lead to open ones.""  Watch could you be an entrepreneur » . Job seekers have been pouring into a hotel ballroom all week for one of the prized jobs. They fill out paperwork and then are taken up to a hotel room in groups of ten or so. The beds have been removed from the room, and they sit in a circle while store managers holding clipboards ask questions. Most are told they will hear back within three weeks. But some get word right away. ""Hey guess what. I got the job,"" exclaimed Rebecca Erickson, speaking to her mother on her cell phone. When the other applicants filed out the managers asked her to stay behind and offered her a job. She was so excited she forgot to ask how much the job pays. ""It's only part-time, but I'll take it. There's always room for advancement, and with it being a new store opening you never know, a full-time position may open up,"" she said. Erickson, a 31-year old single mother of three, has been unemployed for about two months and has been supporting her family on about $1400 a month in unemployment benefits and food stamps. ""It's awesome; It's great; I love it,"" she said. ""To know that I got a job and they have had over a thousand applications come in for this job, and to know that I am the one to get it is just awesome."" A store opening such as this one is rare. With unemployment at 7.2 percent nationwide and retail sales down for six straight months, there are more going-out-of-business signs than grand-opening signs. Most of the applicants came alone, but a set of identical twins came here as a team. ""Where ever he goes, I go,"" said Jeri Hines, here with his brother Jerell. The 23-year-olds seem to always have a smile on their faces and insist on working together. They have spent the past year doing odd jobs such as raking leaves and shoveling snow while working on a comic book. ""Its about a girl running around looking for treasure,"" Jerell said. As the Hines twins make their way up to the interview room, their strategy is simple. ""Be really energetic and be sure they know everything they can about you,"" Jerell Hines said .

4,"(CNN) -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of his newly rented Bailey, Colorado, home, thankful for his Good Samaritan landlord and worried that his previous home, parked in the driveway, wouldn't get him to work the next day. John and Katie Spieker stand next to their camper with baby son, Jacob. His 1977 Toyota Dolphin camper, which Spieker rescued from a salvage yard, had carried him, his wife, Katie, and 4-month-old son, Jacob, from Florida to Colorado earlier this summer, a cross-country sojourn in search of work. He was uncertain it could handle the 14-mile commute the next morning, but he'd make do. ""I'm gonna get up extra early every morning like I have been, and if it [the camper] doesn't get to work, I'm gonna hitchhike,"" Spieker said last week. ""I have a wife and a son to support."" Spieker had been making $12 an hour plus commission at his information technology job in Trenton, Florida. Katie was working part-time in a candle shop, and between them they pulled in a little more than $2,500 a month. But Katie, 21, quit to have the baby, and they moved into a bigger, more expensive house to accommodate their larger family. As June approached, Spieker, 36, was told his hours and commission were being cut as Florida's economy sank. ""It got to the point where $6.50 an hour with a house just ain't gonna happen. I was trying to do good for my family, but what can I do?"" he asked. His last day of work in Florida was June 30. With Florida's unemployment rate at 10.6 percent in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, he investigated where prospects might be better, settling on Colorado (7.6 unemployment), and if things didn't work out there, North Dakota (the nation's lowest unemployment at 4.2 percent). The Spieker family prepared for the trip by holding a yard sale a few days before they were set to leave Trenton, a town of 1,800 near Gainesville. They dutifully cleaned up the home they rented but could no longer afford. ""You're not going to pay the rent, you get out of the house, you know?"" Spieker said. They hit the road with $1,000 in cash, a cell phone, some food and what clothing they could fit. The rickety old camper required some minor repairs along the way: a new battery strap after being bounced around on a rough Alabama highway, some brake work after one stuck near St. Charles, Missouri. Spieker said he sold wire art in taverns during the journey to earn extra money. He was teased by opportunities that didn't pan out. ""I never actually saw this before, but some towns are actually putting billboards up that say 'This town has jobs,' "" he said of his travels through the nation's heartland. ""I actually went to check it out,"" he said. ""They've got a couple jobs, but nothing really great. They've got some jobs I'm not qualified for, in the medical field,"" he said. Still without work after arriving in Colorado, the Spiekers lived ""out in the woods"" for a few weeks. They didn't consider themselves homeless, John Spieker said, ""just camping."" Using computers at a local office supply store and the library, Spieker and his family have been able to tap private and public assistance to care for themselves. A local church has taken care of some day-to-day needs. ""I went down and talked to them and said, 'Hey this is what the situation is, if there's any help available.' They said they could probably help us out with food, baby needs,"" Spieker said. ""And we're actually going to apply for medical assistance."" As for food stamps, Spieker said he'd rather the program be used on the infirm than someone like himself who could provide -- no matter how meager the fixings -- for his family. ""I'm sure there's other people out there that don't have the motivation or the ability [to work] that can use the food stamps,"" he said. Katie doesn't fret about the family's circumstances either. She said she leaves ""all the financial details up to John."" ""My main job is to take care of Jacob,"" she said. Life got a bit easier on July 20, when Spieker landed work at an auto parts store. A person he connected with through an online forum offered the Bailey house for $350 a month rent, a $400 discount off the normal price. The home's owner is working a temporary contract construction job on the other side of Colorado, Spieker said, enabling the deal. But the ""For Sale"" sign out front and real estate agent's lockbox on the front door remind Spieker about how temporary his lodgings may be. While he's grateful for the auto parts job, nothing is certain there either. A national chain is trying to take over the independent retailer, he said. ""It's a struggling company,"" Spieker said. ""At the same time, he's busy enough to where he needs three people behind the counter."" He's making $10 an hour. But he knows that won't keep his family housed when the cheap rent goes away. ""At this point we have a place to stay for two or three months. He said 'maybe three, probably two,' "" Spieker said, recounting his landlord's words. ""I like it here. I just need something better-paying,"" he said. If he didn't find something soon, he said, ""At this point, I'll be right back into the same scenario."" But for the moment, the Spiekers are enjoying what they have. ""The house is great. It's a one-bedroom, it kind of looks like somebody decided to build an A-frame. It has a really, really nice view,"" Katie said. Drinking in the surroundings on the back porch, John Spieker agrees. ""I have the most awesome view,"" Spieker said, looking at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. ""I can't bring myself to walk off the back porch.""",0.77856755,5391
5,"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- It was supposed to be just another day at work. Job losses suffered by Linda and Chris Metzger have had a ripple effect on other businesses in their community . In early March 2008, 31-year-old Linda Metzger went to the New York office where she had worked as an assistant vice president in the marketing department at Lehman Brothers for about a year. Only 15 minutes into her work day, Metzger was called into her manager's office, where a representative from human resources was waiting. ""They told me that the company was having economic difficulties and that they had to make budget cuts,"" Metzger said. ""They were afraid that they were going to have to let me go and that it was not due to performance."" Metzger says that would be her last day at Lehman Brothers. She was given some time to collect her composure, gather her belongings and head home. She was out of a $90,000-a-year job and was getting married in three months. Metzger says it was a chance for her and her fiancé to refocus, relocate and start a new life. Within a few weeks, they both found jobs near Phoenix, Arizona, earning close to what they were making in New York. They bought a home and two new cars and got married. But the good feelings suddenly and dramatically ended in October when Metzger, who was four months pregnant, showed up to work at Lumension, where she was a marketing manager. Metzger says she was called into the office, and it happened again. She was laid off from her second job in less than a year.  Watch Linda talk about getting laid off » . ""I was so overwhelmed and so shocked that I just immediately burst into tears."" She thought about how she and her new husband, who had just moved across the country, were going to be able to afford their new life and all the bills that came with it. A week later, Chris Metzger was called into his manager's office at the job placement agency where he worked. He was told that because of the economy, his office was closing, and he was out of a job. Now he had to break the news to his wife. ""I just came home, and she was upstairs,"" Chris Metzger said. He tried to find the best way to tell his wife that they no longer had an income. ""I walked upstairs, I gave her a hug, and I said, 'I lost my job today.' "" ""I immediately fell to the floor and just started crying,"" Linda said. Within 10 days, Chris was able to find a new job, but Linda had no such luck. The economy was taking its toll, and very few companies were hiring. They looked at their budget and started to eliminate all the extras, including dining out and gym memberships. Vacations were put on hold; furniture purchases had to wait; fine meals out were now home-cooked meals. The Metzgers' story is playing out all across America as businesses and communities feel the ripple effect of the recession . ""When jobs get lost, demand falls for a whole bunch of businesses. You're not going to buy new shoes; you're going to put new soles on them,"" said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent group that studies recessions. Restaurants where the Metzgers used to dine are now closed. The furniture store where they hoped to fill their home is having a liquidation sale and is closing in three weeks. ""You've pulled back from all your spending except paying your mortgage and putting food on the table,"" Achuthan said. It's a sign of the times. A drive down the Phoenix streets and strip malls are filled with vacant office space . Chris and Linda Metzger are expecting their first child in April. This month, they had to decide between making an expensive COBRA insurance payment or the mortgage payment, and they may have to start asking family for help.

With three teenage daughters, that can be a big challenge, but these days it's more difficult than ever. Keith and Vickie Murdock retrained for new jobs after suffering layoffs. But they remain unemployed. Vickie and Keith are both out of work. They live in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, a tiny mountain town about an hour's drive northeast of Asheville that has lost more than 2,000 jobs since 2003. That's a devastating number, given that Mitchell County's 2000 Census population was only 15,687. Keith was laid off in 2001, when a textile mill closed. He had worked there for 13 years. He did what all the experts say to do: He went back to school, got his GED and retrained to be an auto body mechanic. After graduation, he found a job at nearby Altec Industries. But again, he was laid off in January. Today, he spends his time looking for work. Keith said ""everybody you talk to"" tells him, "" 'well, we're not hiring. We ain't got nothing open right now.'

She decided to retrain and will graduate from the local community college in May as a certified medical assistant. Vickie hopes to get a job at a local clinic, but jobs are hard to come by in this area.

It may not be the food you want to give them, it may not be the food they necessarily prefer, but we give them something."" Community leaders are hoping a focus on promoting mountain crafts and tourism and a growing second home market will spur an economic revitalization. Keith Holtsclaw runs Blue Ridge Regional Hospital, one of the area's largest employers, and heads the county's economic development commission. ""I just don't see manufacturing coming back into the community,"" he said. ""We have to work with what we've got. We have lots of artists here. We are great, we're on the Blue Ridge Parkway, we're on the Appalachian Trail ... so we need to play to our strengths."" Until that economic revitalization happens, Vickie and Keith Murdock are living off unemployment benefits and hoping to find work soon. Vickie tries to calm her anxiety about the everyday costs of life. ""We think that when we get to worrying how we are gonna pay for this,"" she said, ""it's like the Lord makes a way.""

8,"(CNN) -- Jack Borden would like you to consider working well past retirement age. As a 101-year-old attorney, he has the credibility to encourage it. Attorney Jack Borden, 101, says he's never thought about not working. ""What would I do?"" he said. Borden, who has been practicing law for the better part of 70 years, still spends about 40 hours a week at his office in Weatherford, Texas, handling estate planning, probate and real estate matters. Retire? Not while he's able to help folks. ""As long as you are capable, you ought to use what God gave you. He left me here for a reason, and with enough of a mind to do what it is I'm supposed to be doing,"" said Borden, who also has been a district attorney and Weatherford's mayor. He arrives at the practice he shares with his nephew at 6:30 a.m. He goes home for lunch at 10:45 a.m., rests in bed for 45 minutes -- doctor's orders after pneumonia a few years back -- returns to work by 12:45 p.m. and stays until at least 4. Not everyone who works past 65 does so because they want to. In a survey completed last month, 38 percent of respondents working past the age of 62 said they may have to delay retirement even further because of the recession, according to the Pew Research Center's Social and Demographic Trends project. But in answer to another question in the same survey, 54 percent of workers 65 or older said they're working now mainly because they want to. Seventeen percent said their main reason was money, and 27 percent said both factors motivated them. ""Some of them enjoy it, and some of them need the money. But even if they need the money, they also enjoy the work,"" said Cynthia Metzler, president of Experience Works, a nonprofit that helps low-income workers ages 55 and older acquire new job skills. The group, which operates in 30 states and also uses federal funds to pay participants a minimum wage to work community service jobs while they look for other work, last month named Borden as America's Outstanding Oldest Worker -- a title it bestows annually to a worker over 100. Last week, Borden was in Washington to participate in events the group was holding to mark National Employ Older Workers Week. When it comes to putting off retirement out of desire, Borden is hardly alone. Preston Brown, 70, is a police officer in Yakima, Washington. He's enjoying the challenges that come with patrolling streets full time, and the experiences are relatively fresh: The former marketing worker and real estate broker didn't join the force until he was 51. He was attracted to law enforcement as a teen but was told he was too short. The height requirements eventually changed, and after some friends persuaded him to go on a patrol ride-along, he began a process that landed him a job with Yakima police in 1990. Whatever is required, from report-taking to chases, he's up for it. ""From time to time there will be a physical confrontation ... and we can get involved in foot chases and vehicle chases. Usually the vast quantity is on night shift more than [my daytime shift], but still I'm involved in those,"" Brown said. Nineteen years later and still in good shape, he has no plans to stop. He likes the pay but he doesn't have to work: His wife of 53 years has a pension. He could be doing other things, such as playing racquetball and motorcycling with friends, but because he gets four days off after working five roughly 11-hour days, he already has time for that. ""When I wake up and prepare to leave for work, I'm looking forward to it,"" he said. ""It's challenging and exciting."" In Anderson, South Carolina, customers at a Chick-fil-A restaurant might see 88-year-old Frank Childers fixing a door. His wife, Gertrude Childers, 88, might be carrying a tray to a table or refreshing someone's beverage. When Frank Childers retired from his insurance sales job in 1985, he looked forward to free time and fishing. ""I stayed retired for five years. I got tired of sitting around,"" he said. Frank Childers, who had some mechanical experience before working in insurance, took some jobs to stay busy. In 1998, Jon Holmes, the owner-operator of three Anderson Chick-fil-As, asked him to lead his maintenance staff, and Childers has been working there since. Gertrude Childers, a former mill worker, also was hired in 1998 to be a dining room hostess at one of the restaurants. She works 20 hours a week; her husband works about 30. They each said they enjoy the work and the people they've met. They don't have to work for the money, they said, but the pay doesn't hurt. ""It's nice to have your own money, because when I want to go shopping, I don't have to ask nobody,"" Gertrude Childers said, laughing. Experience Works says many low-income workers 55 and older need to find jobs but can't, in part because of the recession. It points to the age group's unemployment rate: It was 6.8 percent in August, up from 2.9 percent three years earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's still better than the rate for all age groups, 9.7 percent in August. Lynn Dusenbery, 62, faces many more years of work out of necessity. The Ashland, Wisconsin, resident sold her floral business four years ago to cover medical bills. Once hoping to retire at 65, she now has no savings, is uninsured, and -- living in a rural area with perennially high unemployment -- still hasn't found full-time work. ""I was a florist for 40 years. I came out with no skills that would get me by in the outside world,"" Dusenbery said. Dusenbery enrolled with Experience Works three years ago and has picked up computer skills and other training and part-time jobs with the group. She's looking for full-time work. As for Borden, work is still energizing and rewarding. ""If I were to quit, I might last a year, but probably not over six months,"" said Borden. ""I have to use a walker because of old age, so there's not much else I could do except sit in my house. Why do that when I can not only enjoy life, but help some people?""",0.7596699,7282

10,"Decatur, Georgia (CNN)  -- LaShonda Durden had just given birth to her second child. She was two weeks back from maternity leave when her supervisor called her into her office. ""You need to be trying to find other employment,"" her manager said. A bereavement coordinator and chaplain at an Atlanta, Georgia-area hospice, Durden suddenly found herself coping with the grief of being unemployed. Sixteen months later, she's still out of work. ""It's a vicious cycle,"" she says. Durden is not alone. She is among the 16.5 percent unemployed African-Americans -- almost twice the rate of unemployment for whites. The figure was included in a new report released Wednesday on the state of black America by the National Urban League. The report presents other sobering statistics on the nation's racial divide on economics, education, health, civic engagement and social justice. Among them: . The median household income for blacks stands at $34,218; for whites, it's $55,530. Less than half of blacks own a home compared to three quarters of white families. Blacks are more than three times as likely to live in poverty. In addition, black-owned businesses represent a paltry 5 percent of privately owned companies, and the study says more are needed to help spur job growth in minority communities. The Obama administration, the study suggests, has taken measures to improve the gap between whites and blacks, although it says more is needed. The report says legislation needs to focus on minority job training, tax incentives and extensions for unemployment benefits. Andrew Grant-Thomas, the deputy director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, says he believes the statistics for unemployed black Americans is far greater than what's being reported. The figures don't include people not actively seeking employment or people with higher education degrees forced to take jobs for which they're overqualified. ""The disparities are definitely huge and that number understates the size of the disparity,"" he says. ""You want to take that number and double it."" ""This recession is even bigger than Katrina hitting New Orleans,"" he adds. ""Yes, everyone got hit, but not everyone was hit equally as hard -- and shouldn't we invest in those hit the hardest?"" The faces of the statistics . On Tuesday, Durden went to Java DeLight Cafe, in a predominantly African-American suburb of Atlanta. She goes there to network and search for jobs via the Internet over its WiFi connection. The cafe  is owned and operated by Patricia Setzer, an African-American who opened the establishment in 2008. She says she can relate to many of her customers. Days after she opened her business, her husband was laid off. It took him eight months to find a new job. ""We literally just went without for awhile,"" she says. Setzer hopes her cafe can serve as a networking hub. She calls it ""the cultural meeting place."" If her regular customers don't return for weeks, she wonders if they've succumbed to hard times: ""When they're not here, I'm thinking about them."" ""We want people to come here and meet and enjoy themselves,"" Setzer says. To that end, she's organizing a job club at her cafe -- a place to host unemployed Americans (of any ethnicity) and give them hands on training, from resume help to how to dress for interviews. Barbers and hair stylists will be on hand for those who need fresh cuts. As a business owner, Setzer is a minority in a minority: Just 5.2 percent of small businesses in the U.S. are black-owned. ""We're all struggling, whether you're white, black or green,"" says Setzer as she flips turkey patties. ""You've just got to hold on."" On this day, Diane Ridley Roberts, president of a management consulting firm, worked from her laptop inside the cafe. Unlike other businesses that aren't hiring, she says she's having trouble finding qualified people. Ridley Roberts, an African-American, says there is no homogenous state of black America. ""To say we're all in one boat is a little naive, I think,"" says the owner of Global Evaluation & Applied Research Solutions. But she adds that there are common experiences that only black Americans can fully relate. Even in 2010, she says, she feels she has to doubly prove herself when she is awarded a contract. ""There are certain judgments, ideas and perceptions about me when I walk into the door as someone's consultant,"" she says. ""It is what it is."" An unexpected job interview . Sipping coffee at a table in the cafe, Durden talks about all manner of difficulty -- from her work as a hospice chaplain to her own layoff and struggle. She's turned her joblessness into action: She volunteers monthly to help the homeless. It's a reminder, she says, that her family ""could be worse off."" ""And that's the blessing for me -- just knowing that I am sustained,"" she says, ""that even if the bottom falls out, God still has us in His hands."" She sends out her resume at least three days a week. She attends job fairs about every two weeks. Those get discouraging, she says, with 400 people jockeying for one position. She holds a sociology degree from Georgia State University and went on to seminary school. At this point, she'll take anything to help her family. And that's another part of the job hunt. She's overqualified for many positions and often wonders: ""Do I dumb down my resume?"" ""I have a passion to help people do better than they're doing now, regardless of where they are in life,"" she says. ""I just love people."" As for her African-American roots, she says, ""It means I expect to excel in what I do because I know who my foremothers and forefathers are. ""Being black in America right now, for me, it means hope. It means keeping that hope when some others may not be able to."" Durden piqued the interest of one person in the cafe. Overhearing Durden's story, Ridley Roberts asks if she has a resume. Durden pulls out her flash drive and downloads a copy. The two then leave the cafe. The impromptu job interview is Durden's best lead in a while. That's the life of the jobless: Networking and constantly searching, even on the fly.

11,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A crowd of about 10,000 came to Dodger Stadium on Saturday, but they weren't there for a baseball game. Job seeker Eric Clardy, right, shakes hands with recruiter Raul Mendez from L.A. County Probation Department. While the Dodgers were in Arizona for spring training, more than 80 employers set up employment booths in the parking lot just beyond the center field fence. To those who turned out, finding a job would be a home run. Participating companies included Coca-Cola, Lowe's and Union Bank. And government agencies including the FBI, the Social Security Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers  were there, too. All had one thing in common: They were hiring. And that was music to the ears of 30-year-old Eric Clardy. It has been a rough couple of years for Clardy. He was laid off from his job as a loan processor when the real estate market started to tank. Then, after finding work as a project manager for a plumbing company, layoffs struck again. ""It's kind of like, get the job now so you can pay your bills, then start towards the career that you really want,"" he said. Clardy said his goal is to make contact with at least 10 potential employers a day via phone, letters and the Internet. Being unemployed is hard work, too.  Watch how Clardy goes about trying to find a job » . ""It was a scramble,"" Clardy said. ""I was selling insurance, doing temp jobs, going to job fairs."" The city of Los Angeles and the California Employment Development Department organized Saturday's event, which they said drew about 10,000 people. Earlier this month, a two-day job fair to fill some 500 part-time jobs at the stadium during baseball season drew about 7,000 applicants. California's unemployment rate is 10.1 percent, a full 2 percentage points higher than the national rate. The state's Employment Development office estimates that nearly a half-million state residents have lost their jobs in the past year. ""We are not seeing as many job opportunities as we saw a year ago,"" said Gloria Bratton Moore, who runs the state-funded Work Source job center in Los Angeles. Nonetheless, she said, ""There are jobs available."" But at Dodger Stadium, it was clear that competition for those available jobs is stiff. Applicants were often stacked four and five people deep in front of employer tables, and there was little chance for most of the 10,000 job seekers to make much of an impression. But organizers worked hard to pump up any flagging spirits. ""Yes we can. Yes we can,"" Los Angeles School Board member Monica Garcia chanted over a loudspeaker. State lawmaker Kevin deLeon told the crowd that they are among the nation's hardest-hit in this economic downturn, but he exhorted them to not give up. ""We will get out of this economic funk,"" he said. ""We will recover soon. We've got to have hope."" Garcia and deLeon's comments echoed the campaign slogans of President Obama, who recently won approval of a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus package. Recruiters from the government agencies present at the job fair said that money will start creating jobs within the next few months. The Army Corps of Engineers told applicants that it is hiring for a wide variety of positions, including those for engineers, heavy-equipment operators and environmental field workers. The Commerce Department is adding more than 1 million jobs in preparation of the 2010 census, and other federal agencies are hiring as well. All of that was good news to Clardy, who left resumes and filled out applications at a number of the 80 booths cluttering the stadium's parking lot. But he remained realistic about this day's activities leading directly to a job. ""It seemed like a couple of years ago, the job fair was really your first interview,"" he said. ""Now it doesn't seem like that. Some companies are not even taking resumes at the job fairs anymore.""",0.7329085,2018
12,"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on issues affecting communities across the country. Pope McLean Jr. tells CNN's John King that a lot of farms are hurting because of the global recession. LEXINGTON, Kentucky (CNN) -- Crestwood Farm is tucked into the rolling hillsides of Kentucky's legendary bluegrass country. Kipling and Unbridled Energy are among the stallions critical to the reputation -- and the bottom line -- of the McLean family business. And just how do the stallions prove their value? ""When their progeny does well on the race track,"" Pope McLean Jr. said. ""Can't bluff that. That's when they prove what they are worth."" Pope McLean Sr. got into the horse business in college and took over Crestwood Farm in 1970. His son worked on the farm while growing up. After college he took a job in the financial sector, but in 1991 he returned to Crestwood. His brother Marc returned a few years later, and their younger sister Grandison joined after she graduated from college. ""It's been pretty much a family business since that point,"" Pope McLean Jr. said during a tour of the 1,000 acre property. Kentucky is to horse racing what Michigan is to the domestic auto industry. Racing and breeding thoroughbreds is a multibillion-dollar business in the state and the source of some 100,000 jobs. But ""The Sport of Kings"" is hardly exempt from these painful economic times, and in fact is taking a severe blow in the global recession. ""It's truly an international industry, so we have people, a lot of buyers, from Europe come in. And they have dialed back,"" McLean said. ""Domestic buyers have dialed back their participation, as well. The good horses are still bringing decent money, but everyone has to lower their expectations."" At this year's Keeneland September Yearling Sale, which McLean calls the horse industry's version of the NBA draft, the gross was down more than 41 percent from last year, the largest year-to-year drop in the 66-year history of the auction. ""The prices are down, and our production costs increased with commodity prices going up and so forth, so it definitely puts a squeeze on commercial breeding operations,"" McLean said. ""A lot of farms are hurting. And then you have the credit squeeze that has hurt a lot of farms, too."" McLean sees another lean year next year, and then hopes for a rebound because of an odd twist to the laws of supply and demand. In 2008, when the stock market was plummeting, 30 percent fewer mares were bred, so the supply of horses available at auction the year after next will be smaller. ""I think people just decided to pull back,"" McLean said. ""So the supply of horses available at auction will be reduced and that should start to help market conditions."" At Crestwood, McLean predicts an ""about even"" year. ""We're down at bit,"" at the moment, he says. ""I feel pretty sure there will be quite a few farms that will go out of business."" Out of business is an all too common theme in Hazard, a coal country town in Eastern Kentucky's Appalachia region about 120 miles away from Lexington and horse country. Statewide, the unemployment rate in Kentucky is 11.1 percent. Hazard is the county seat in Perry County, where the jobless rate has been on a steady climb and is 12.7 percent. On Main Street, a clothing and novelty store is closing down, along with an adjacent print and copying shop. Fallout, locals say, from the closing of a uniform plant that had employed more than 140 people, and then a Weyerhaeuser lumber facility that employed 180. Joanne Caron knew there were problems when Weyerhaeuser canceled weekend shifts, ""but we didn't think it would be that drastic."" The bad news came suddenly in March when workers were told their jobs were being eliminated immediately. ""They called us in the conference room and said due to market conditions, you know, they had to shut us down."" Caron has been looking for work for seven months. Nothing. Her unemployment check is $746 every two weeks. She cashed in her Weyerhaeuser 401(k) and, despite the long-term risks, allows herself a small slice of that money every month, as well. ""My daughter likes to eat, and she likes clothes,"" Caron said with a shrug. ""And we like heat and air conditioning. That's the choices we have to make."" Her 19-year-old is enrolled at the local community college, where Joanne also plans to take classes in hopes of improving her job prospects. Two older daughters completed college over the past two years, one in Florida and other here in Kentucky, but neither has been able to find work. ""So everything I told them as they were growing up: go to college, get a degree so you can get a good job, it's just not working out that way."" Caron tries to keep her spirits up, dryly joking that ""you get to see everybody during the day because nobody's at work."" But the long search can be demoralizing. ""I worked all my life and now I'm collecting an unemployment check. I feel real uncomfortable about that, but there's no jobs available."" When Caron returned to the Weyerhaeuser plant for the first time, it made her feel sad. ""The last shift I worked was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Twelve hour shifts,"" she said as she looked through the fence, chained and padlocked shut. ""Sad to see it like this,"" Caron said. ""I made a lot of good friends working there. We had good times working in there. It wasn't a glamorous job, but we had fun and we got along, and I miss seeing those people every day.""",0.73119104,7721
13,"(CNN) -- Miriam Brown has always wanted to visit Cape Cod, but when she recently began to plan a trip and found out she would have to pay $200 or more a night for lodging, her dream vacation seemed out of reach. Miriam Brown and her husband bartered their services for room and board on Cape Cod. Brown, who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an accountant. Her husband is a home renovations contractor. Like many people dealing with a soft real estate market and high food and gas prices, they just don't have that kind of extra cash for a trip. ""I have traveled a lot in prior years, but after [Hurricane] Katrina, there's just no money for traveling,"" Brown said. So she still plans to go, but she won't spend any cash at all on lodging. Brown has joined the growing ranks of Americans who are bartering -- trading goods and services without exchanging money -- as a way to cope with tough economic times. Brown posted an ad in the barter section of the online community Craigslist last month, offering to trade her accounting skills and her husband's knack for home repairs in exchange for room and board on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. She has lots of company. There were some 142,000 listings in the barter section of Craigslist in July, or almost double the number posted during the same month last year, according to Craigslist spokeswoman Susan MacTavish Best. ""When the economy turns unfriendly, Craigslist users become far more creative to get their everyday tasks done,"" Best said. Swapping 'to get by' Other Web sites that put Americans in touch with like-minded people who are willing to trade everything under the sun have also seen a boost in traffic. SwapThing, which lists almost 3.5 million ""things"" available for trade, reports its customers are bartering for different reasons than before. ""I think a few years ago it was more for fun,"" said Jessica Hardwick, SwapThing founder and CEO. ""But we've seen a real shift in the last year, and especially an increase in the last few months, where I think people are really doing it to get by."" Some of the most popular items to trade for late this summer were school uniforms, which some parents found they could not afford to buy for their children, Hardwick said. Experts aren't surprised Americans are becoming more financially creative during an economic downturn. ""Historically, when times get tough, you see a 50 percent-plus increase in bartering as a way for people to be able to buy things or get things and do it economically,"" said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group. The company talks with thousands of consumers every week to gauge their spending habits and attitudes. A couple of years ago, many Americans had $500 to spend at the end of the month, but that money has evaporated because of rising prices, Beemer said. ""We've never had a time, at least in my lifetime, where you have food and fuel going up at the same time. So it isn't a question of buying things, it's a question of buying nothing,"" Beemer said. Breast implants and a horse . Businesses have long recognized the benefits of bartering, and there are hundreds of barter networks set up across the country to fill their needs. They use barter credits as currency, so a plumber in need of a filling doesn't need to search for a dentist's office with plumbing problems to make a deal. He can fix a leaky pipe for one member of a network and use the credits he earned for that job at any other. Since all kinds of companies are members, the trades can be all over the map, said Michael Krane, president of Green Apple Barter Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His company has brokered everything from breast implants to college tuition to a horse. ""Really, there are no limits to it. We trade for just about anything you can think of,"" Krane said. Bartering on this scale is also robust in tough economic times. Krane said his exchange has seen a 20 percent rise in barter transaction volume in the first six months of this year. A longtime client is Thomas Forrest, an orthodontist in suburban Pittsburgh who barters his services for everything from office improvements to stationery. His practice hasn't been affected by the economic downturn, Forrest said, but some of his patients seem glad to be able to visit him under the barter arrangement. ""I think if you have a business owner who has children in need of braces, I sense a gratitude that that's available,"" Forrest said. Barter exchanges must carefully document all trades, since the Internal Revenue Service considers income from bartering as taxable. However, a barter exchange ""does not include arrangements that provide solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis,"" according to the IRS. In New Orleans, Brown and her husband are getting ready to go to Cape Cod after finding a taker for her bartering offer on Craigslist. The couple will work five hours a day in exchange for staying in ""a beautiful three-bedroom house right in the center of it all,"" Brown said. ""We can do a lot more if we don't have to pay for room and board,"" she added.",0.7311522,7489

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in December the South recorded one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country at 7 percent. According to Careerbuilder.com, the nation's largest online job site, the South continues to see growth in the oil and gas industries which means more job opportunities in related fields like engineering.

Sean, Brooke and Courtney with their parents, Donna and Robert LeBlanc, in a 2008 Christmas photo. (CNN) -- Donna LeBlanc gave her husband, a former restaurant manager, the stark ultimatum: become a pizza delivery man or their family ""wouldn't make it."" The Lafayette, Louisiana, family of six was struggling with $45,000 of mounting medical debt from Donna LeBlanc's unexpected case of pneumonia and tonsillitis a year earlier. The family savings account had dwindled to $100. ""It's embarrassing for my husband to take a job he is overqualified for, and I know he feels ashamed at times,"" says Donna LeBlanc, a 35-year-old mother with four children. ""But this is what we have to do and we're going to make the best out of it."" She watched her husband, Rob LeBlanc, 35, load Domino's pizza boxes into their family car and deliver orders until near dawn for $10 an hour. The family first told their story of falling on hard times on iReport.com. Share your economic survivor story with CNN. Until last summer, Rob LeBlanc had worked as a manager at a truck stop restaurant, making $55,000 a year. He lost that job to the falling economy. Rob LeBlanc says he noticed business at the truck stop getting sluggish a year ago. Then the spike in gas prices last summer exacerbated the restaurant's dire circumstances. Many penny-pinching truck drivers avoided his restaurant altogether, he says. Rob LeBlanc filed for unemployment compensation immediately after he lost his job. More than 4.6 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits as of early January, according to the Labor Department. In Lafayette, a quiet city of about 114,000 tucked away in southern Louisiana, many of the jobs center around servicing the oil and gas industry, but Rob LeBlanc was unwilling to work offshore and away from his family. When he applied for other jobs, he was told he was either under-qualified or had too much experience. After several weeks of searching, he took the only job he could get -- a Domino's pizza delivery man, a job that would cover the family's expenses. ""I had to swallow my pride and take whatever I could get,"" Rob LeBlanc says. ""I kept telling myself one of these days something better will come along."" He spent nearly five months delivering pizzas at Domino's. He admits he fell into depression during that time. But the family received good news Friday, when a private security company hired Rob LeBlanc to be a security officer. He says the company offers many opportunities to move up to a managerial position. ""My first thought was to tell my wife right away,"" he says. ""I could hear the relief in her voice."" Taking a job as a pizza man wasn't the only sacrifice he's made for his family -- he's also selling his beloved 2003 Kawasaki motorcycle. Donna LeBlanc earns a few hundred dollars a week exterminating mosquitoes for a bug control company. Before her husband lost his job, she had talked of going back to school to pursue a biology degree at Louisiana State University. The LeBlanc family lives lean in their five-bedroom, three-bathroom house with its $440 a month mortgage. The couple is teaching their children about budgeting and bargaining while relying on coupons and sales. They no longer eat out and no longer have cable TV. For entertainment, they attend free movies at a church. Donna LeBlanc takes pride that they have no credit card debt. Their children Brooke, 9, Christopher, 14, and Courtney, 13, no longer receive allowances. Soon after her father's job loss, Courtney started cleaning houses and baby-sitting and earned enough money to buy a dress for her first school dance -- off the clearance rack. The LeBlancs' oldest child, Sean, 16, who attends high school, still hasn't found a job. He says the competition has gotten stiff, with many older workers in the area out of jobs. ""I'm trying,"" said Sean, who has been looking for a job since October. ""There are just no openings."" The LeBlancs have found some unexpected happiness. Donna LeBlanc says her husband now spends more time at home. Not being able to leave the house for entertainment has brought the children closer together over books, games and conversation.

19,"(CNN) -- Surviving economically in downtrodden Elkhart, Indiana, may require doing some things you don't want to do. Elkhart, Indiana, has become the poster child for the nation's economic downturn. ""Here in Elkhart, I've never seen things as bad as they are,"" lifelong resident Yvonne Sell said Tuesday. ""When you open the newspaper, unless you want to be a topless dancer, there's nothing."" Elkhart became the poster child for the nation's economic downturn when President Obama visited there Monday and then mentioned it several times during his first White House press conference. Unemployment in the Elkhart-Goshen, Indiana, area was 15.3 percent in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, the fourth highest of any U.S. metropolitan area. Elkhart's unemployment rate has spiked more than 10 percentage points in the past 13 months. But is it really that bad in Elkhart? According to Sell and several other business owners and workers, it is. Sell and her four co-owners are in the process of selling Blessing Music Co., which has sold, rented and repaired musical instruments for school bands since 1916. ""We're not making money. It's just too tight,"" Sell said. The company has high overhead and a ""considerable"" high-interest loan, and credit continues to be a problem, she said. Sell said she isn't hopeful that any government plan will kick-start commerce in Elkhart or elsewhere. The banks, which started the mess, have already been bailed out, she said, but ""I'm not seeing them loosening their purse strings."" Small businesses as well as individuals need credit -- not government spending -- to keep the economy churning, she said. Take, for example, recreational vehicles, one of the town's knotted lifelines: Sell said she knows plenty of people willing to purchase RVs, but they can't without a bank loan. ""People won't buy them because they're too scared,"" she said. ""I don't personally see how spending the amount of money [Congress is] talking about spending is going to stimulate the economy."" Robert Dunlop runs a different kind of business, but he agrees with Sell. ""Unfortunately, when you drop a ton of money to pay billion-dollar bonuses on the East Coast, it kind of sucks on the Midwest,"" said Dunlop, president of J.A. Wagner Construction Co. in Elkhart. ""If banks can free up a little bit of credit so that people can buy products and get people back to work, that would be good for this area."" People in Elkhart who were interviewed said they don't have much confidence in the government's ability to resolve the crisis, though Dunlop said he thinks tax relief would help some. ""Unfortunately, you still have to have a job to have relief from the tax burden, and a lot of these people are behind in house payments and, quite frankly, it's a vicious cycle: You don't have a job, you can't make your house payment, you're not out buying anything. Even if you reduce the tax burden to those people, they still need to have some sort of income. When that occurs, they start buying things, which creates more jobs, which then starts the cycle back up again."" Elkhart Mayor Dick Moore echoes that view. He said people need jobs so they have money to spend and support industries such as RVs. The Democrat supports the stimulus plan Obama was touting in his town Monday because it will get residents to work quickly. ""It's jobs, jobs, jobs,"" Moore told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday.  Watch what Elkhart's mayor says about the president's visit » . ""We have 16 shovel-ready projects ready to go ... These are not pie-in-the-sky items; they're not pork. ... These are projects we will have to do,"" Moore said. But gift shop owner Joanie Smith said she thinks government programs are no solution. ""I think that the government and the banks are the biggest problem, because we have checks and balances to make sure what happened didn't happen, and obviously it didn't work,"" she said. ""They've already bailed out the banks; I don't know why the banks aren't lending money or offering the assistance that most businesses run with."" Smith saw traffic at her gift shop start dropping off at the end of 2007. ""I have a store that is full of wonderful things, but nothing anybody needs,"" Smith, owner of The Picture Show for 27 years, said with a tense laugh. ""We're just in a real reality-check area right now. It's hard not being negative."" Smith has survived in retail by being financially conservative -- she doesn't have any loans to repay and has cut hours for her two employees, she said. Several years ago she downsized her shop from more than 4,000 square feet to a cozy 1,200. Smith said she feels protective of Elkhart and its image. ""It's a real entrepreneurial city,"" she said. ""We still manufacture here. We still create here. And unfortunately we've lost so much of our diversity of businesses here to China."" Despite these lean times, Smith said she is determined to stay in business. ""Women love to come in here and shop, and we want to be there for them.""",0.7174705,2909
20,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Samuel Welsh's chances of landing a job before this economic downturn were already slim. Samuel Welsh, laid off since 2006, has found solace in his faith. ""You got to keep God in your heart,"" he said. Now, as a disabled worker, the 29-year-old is competing with thousands of nondisabled job seekers going for jobs once allocated for the disabled population. Welsh was laid off from his job as an executive assistant in 2006. ""I did mortgages, refinances and purchase deals. I was dismissed from that job and after that I was sent over to the Bobby Dodd Institute to do my vocational rehab counseling,"" he said. The Bobby Dodd Institute in Atlanta provides job training and rehabilitation for people with disabilities. Meg Godfrey, an employment specialist with BDI, has been handling Welsh's case. ""He came to us originally looking for a position in administrative clerical type work. We have lowered his goals to greeting and ticket-taking, but those are the first jobs that go in this type of economy,"" she said. As part of her job, Godfrey seeks potential employers who will allocate some of their positions for people with disabilities, but as unemployment has soared, competition has gotten fierce. ""Usually, we can get three to five jobs a month. Lately it's been one or no jobs each month. There are some employers I have talked to about hiring our clients. It's in a restaurant-type business and they have people coming in and putting applications that have previously worked at Morgan Stanley,"" she said. For Welsh, the competition and the wait have proven too long. He recently started a home cake-making business using cooking skills he learned from his grandmother when he was growing up in Alabama. He gets orders from local clients and delivers the cakes with the aid of public transit for the disabled. He gets about three orders a week, at an average price of $15 per cake. Welsh said he evaluated his skills and abilities before starting his business. ""I know that I can bake cakes. I know that people like cakes; people like to eat a little something sweet, "" he said. He added that he has not lost hope about finding a job. Wayne McMillan, CEO of BDI, says job numbers for people with disabilities show little hope. ""It's terrible to be without a job in this country. It's tragic to have a disability and be without a job. We are having people come through the programs that we are not being able to place. Last year we placed 171 folks; during the month of December zero; January two. This is a real crisis for us,"" McMillan said. For the first time, the Department of Labor in February released a report tracking unemployment rates among disabled job seekers. The survey found a 14 percent unemployment rate among disabled workers -- almost double that of the nondisabled population. And only 21 percent of the available working disabled population is employed, compared with the 65 percent of nondisabled workers. ""It is not at the top of most people's minds,"" said Megan Rutter Branch, director of communication for BDI. ""They are seeing family members go off and have the dignity of work, and earn a paycheck, and the only expectation that is had of them is to sit at home, watch TV and stay out of trouble."" She emphasized that disabled workers have one of the highest retention rates in the industry, 82 percent to 87 percent, according to BDI figures. ""Our folks wouldn't want to leave. They had to overcome all these hurdles to get a job."" According to the U.S. Census, people with disabilities comprise the largest minority group, approximately 20 percent of the population. Robin L. Shaffert, senior director of corporate social responsibility with the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), says it is critical for this group to be included in economic recovery plans. ""It is very important for our society that we are using all the productive force of our society. It is important that we are also looking at people with disabilities and make sure we are looking for solutions for them as well,"" Shaffert said. AAPD research shows that President Obama's economic stimulus package has allocated funds to help people with disabilities, such as increased Medicaid help, vocational rehabilitation, help with independent living and specialized education. Until that help comes, Welsh, who suffers from spina bifida, says he is holding onto his faith. ""You got to keep God in your heart.

Stories like Shows' are more common these days. The unemployment rate was at 7.6 percent in January, and, strange as it may seem, at least one travel company, an airline and a travel-bag maker are now catering to the layoff crowd -- both the recently let go and the future unemployed. For those who buy a plane ticket before they get the ax, JetBlue is offering to refund fares. The JetBlue Promise promotion is good for customers laid off on or after February 17 and applies to ticket purchases made between February 1 and June 1. The program is designed to appeal to people who haven't been downsized but worry they might be, said Alison Croyle, a spokeswoman for the airline. ""It's something that we felt would provide an advantage to customers who otherwise might be too stressed to book future travel plans,"" she said. Then there's the already-laid-off demographic. On some packages, Intrepid Travel is giving a 15 percent discount to people who've recently been let go. The deal, with the tongue-in-cheek title, ""Laid off? How about taking off?"" has gotten a few dozen takers in the two months it's been offered, said Leslie Cohen, spokeswoman for the travel company. Cohen said the discount is designed to give people a chance to clear their heads during a tough transition. Some of the deals start at less than $1,000, she said. The company is ""not suggesting you use your life savings,"" she said. ""It's really just a chance to catch your breath and see something else and come back in a little bit of a different frame of mind."" For those looking to hit the skies on the job hunt rather than escape it, SkyRoll, maker of a $149.99 garment bag, says it's giving a discount. ""If you recently lost your job and need to travel for an interview, we will take 50 percent off the price of a SkyRoll to help you arrive looking your best,"" the company says on its Web site. To get the discount, SkyRoll requires customers to e-mail the company a layoff notice. Travel discounts like the one from Intrepid may be great for unemployed people who have hefty savings accounts or large severance packages, but the program also could prey on the unemployed, said Madeline Hughes, who runs a consulting and outplacement group in Denver, Colorado. The cost of a big trip ""could be lunch money for somebody for the next six months,"" she said. Hughes tells her clients who are laid off they need to come up with a career plan -- and quickly -- because the job market is so competitive. If a person truly has a thick enough checkbook to afford a post-layoff vacation, Hughes said she would tell the person to send out plenty of resumes before hitting the beach. ""If you really do want to get away, then at least get somewhat of a plan so when you're on vacation you're not fretting about what you're going to do when you get back,"" she said. ""People can't relax if they're afraid and they don't have a plan and they're sort of panicked."" Daphne Domingo, a life coach in Seattle, Washington, said people who've been laid off should take vacations so they have time to reassess their lives -- but they should gauge the scope of their travel on their savings account. ""Be a tourist in your own town"" if you don't have the money to travel, she said. ""That way, you can save money on accommodations."" Domingo and Hughes said all job seekers should weigh their situations individually. Jonathan Hagelstein, a 32-year-old from New York, plans to use Intrepid's package to travel to Africa and Europe for nearly a month. This is the second major trip he's taken since being laid off from a finance job in June. But Hagelstein says he's a ""compulsive saver"" and wants to make use of the free time while he has it. ""Time is something that you can never get back. You can always earn more money,"" he said. ""I'm not getting any younger. ... This is an opportunity -- I feel -- of a lifetime."" With each trip, he hopes the job market will be better when he returns. He said he has no leads on a job. Shows -- the man from Ohio, who first shared his story on iReport.com, CNN's user-submitted content site -- took off on a road trip as a way to reanalyze his life. See Shows' story on iReport.com . He said he hadn't taken a substantial trip during the decade or so he worked in information technologies at LexisNexis, a database and information company. So he saw the layoff partly as a gift of free time. Shows said he has a stable enough income since he is also a retired police officer. But he said his car trip was relatively cheap. The adventure took him to six states and cost less than $1,000, he said. Plus, it helped him reconnect with his passion. ""If I could do anything I wanted to do in life, it would be to take the camera out and go out to talk to people and get stories,"" he said. Shows said he plans to take photojournalism classes at a local community college this spring.",0.7112346,8450

23,"ASHLAND, Ohio (CNN)  -- An Ohio bakery shut down in October is bustling again, with 60 eager employees who had expected a Christmas on the unemployment rolls. Cookie production has resumed and some workers are back on the job at the Archway factory in Ashland, Ohio. Some 300 workers lost their jobs when the Archway cookie factory in Ashland, Ohio, was suddenly closed by the private equity firm that owned it. The workers also were left without benefits like health insurance. But then Lance Inc., a Charlotte, North Carolina-based snack food company, purchased Archway at a bankruptcy auction. And last week 60 workers were asked to return immediately, with perhaps more coming back in the months ahead. Kathy Sexton, a worker at the bakery, had been preparing her children for a very modest holiday.  Watch the holiday brighten for workers » . ""They said they understood,"" Sexton recalls. ""They said, 'That's all right, Mom.' You always want to give them more, but ... I didn't think I would be able to."" Now she can. Tiny Ashland has been  struggling. Ohio has lost 200,000 jobs over the past eight years. The recent presidential campaign saw both candidates visiting frequently. The outlook in Ashland became especially bleak when the Archway plant closed. Workers at the bakery said they felt betrayed when Archway at first said there would be more work in a day or two, but then changed the locks. Rita Devan remembers. ""They just kept taking and taking until there was nothing left to take,"" Devan says, ""and they didn't care that they were putting 300 people out of work."" Things are different now. When it promised to reopen the bakery, Lance gave all 300 former Archway workers a $1,500 prepaid debit card. ""I was crying,"" Devan says of the gift. ""I am like, 'What are these people doing? They don't know me. They don't know us. They don't know any of the Archway people. And they are giving each and every one of us $1,500.' "" Sexton -- the woman who'd been preparing her kids for a meager holiday -- says of the $1,500 gift: ""It was awesome. My first thought was, 'I can give my kids a Christmas.' "" David Singer, CEO of Lance, says the gift cards were a way of letting Ashland know the new owners are different. ""We wouldn't do it willy-nilly,"" Singer says. ""We do want to make money. But this is the pool of folks that we intend to hire. We just wanted to let them know who we were."" The 60 workers rehired so far are earning their previous salary and retained their seniority. They also were provided health insurance from day one. The bakery now produces Lance cookies that are sold to big chains like Target and Wal-Mart. But production of Archway cookies is scheduled to resume soon. Lance has told the employees that it hopes to have the plant fully operational by the end of 2009 -- that is, five lines of cookies being produced simultaneously. The new owners say that if new orders keep flowing in, more jobs will follow. Terry Mowry is another worker rehired by Lance. He says what has happened is hard to describe: ""You just saw life being breathed right back into the face of these people."" And Devan says with a laugh: ""I walked into the garage last night, and my husband says, 'You actually smell like a cookie again.' "" ""He said, 'Boy, I missed that smell.' """,0.7042584,6396
24,"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences covering the news. Here, CNN Anchor Rick Sanchez describes spending some time with day laborers for a report that will air on 'Out in the Open' tonight at 8 ET. CNN's Rick Sanchez, pictured center, visits a street corner where many people gather to seek manual labor jobs. PALISADES PARK, New Jersey (CNN) -- For four hours Friday morning, I joined about 200 immigrants -- legal and illegal -- at a day-laborer site at the corner of East Columbia Avenue and Broad Avenue in downtown Palisades Park, New Jersey. My goal was not to find a job; rather it was to see how day laborers go about finding one themselves. Dressed in jeans, running shoes and a short-sleeve shirt, I looked like one of them. I also carried over my shoulder a bag containing a hidden camera. Day laborer sites like this one have sprung up all over the country. The laborers -- mostly immigrants, mostly men -- come to them to find jobs in construction or masonry or painting or landscaping. Some communities encourage the formation of these sites. In others, they have become lightning rods of controversy. In Palisades Park, they have become fixtures. At the site I visited, the last thing the folks there needed was more competition for jobs, but they nonetheless welcomed me into their group. They gave me pointers about how to get a good job. ""Always ask how much,"" one man told me in Spanish as he prepped me in the art of negotiating for a days' wage. Another said it's better to be paid by the day instead of the hour. That way you're assured of a decent payment even if the work is cut short or the job is finished early. The guys I met told me they come here seven days a week. They wait and wait and wait for work. ""Sometimes there's no work, sometimes there is work. Not every day,"" one man said. It gets worse when winter comes. ""When it's cold, there's no work,"" another told me. A good week, they said, is one where they get offered jobs on two days for about $90 a day. That's a weekly salary of $180. It's barely enough to put food on the table, but it's better than the alternative. Life in Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, they said, offers little in the way of income -- about $5 a week for manual labor. ""We don't have a choice but to try to save a little bit and go back to our country,"" a 23-year-old Guatemalan man told me. The routine is simple: Show up early and wait for hours until a prospective employer shows up, if one shows up. As more people flock to these sites the competition for jobs gets intense. ""There are a lot of people ... and I mean a lot of people at the stop here. So you no longer get a lot of work,"" the Guatemalan said. On Friday, I was there for 3½ hours until I finally witnessed a job offer. It came from, ironically, another immigrant. He was from the Ivory Coast, Africa, new in America himself, and delighted to provide work for fellow immigrants. He was looking for someone to help him move furniture and other belongings. These immigrants -- the African with a job and the Latinos seeking work -- negotiated the job terms in broken English, with African and Spanish accents swirling in the air. ""I need two,"" said the African employer referring to the number of workers. ""Two dollars is not enough,"" responded the Guatemalan. After much arm waving and false starts, they eventually figured out what the other was saying and a deal was struck. Many of the men here have a love-hate relationship with the United States. They miss their home countries but feel compelled to stay here out of economic necessity. ""All you get in this country is bitterness, sadness and loneliness,"" one man told me. ""But money,"" I interjected. ""Of course, that's true,"" he responded. ""First place is ... the money, that's why we come."" E-mail to a friend .

25,"(CNN) -- Amanda Mezyk had developed a close bond with her employers' children as their live-in nanny, which is why it was so painful when her bosses told her she was being laid off. Amanda Mezyk, 20, lost her live-in nanny job when the recession forced her employers to cut the family budget. ""I started crying and they kept repeating, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'"" Mezyk, 20, said about the day last November when her employers -- a Miami, Florida, plastic surgeon and a part-time dermatologist -- delivered the bad news. ""They sat me down in the living room -- where we usually would sit and talk about the kids -- and they told me that business was slow and they had to cut expenses."" As Mezyk began to realize that life as a virtual member of her employers' family was ending, she thought about the little girl and boy -- Delaney, 6, and Landon, 4 -- with whom she had grown so close during the past 2½ years. Later, Landon found Mezyk crying in her bedroom and asked her what was wrong. ""I told him I had to go away for a little while, and that I would come visit,"" she said. ""I was sad because I had to let the kids go,"" she said. ""I love them like they were mine. And I want to be a part of their lives for the long run."" Her job as a live-in nanny at a lavish home in an upper-class, upscale private community came with many perks that suddenly had disappeared. The insured car provided by her employers for personal and professional use was gone. Without a steady income, Mezyk wondered how she would pay her mounting $8,000 credit card debt. There would be no more accompanying the family on all-expenses-paid vacations to the Bahamas, Italy and China. The layoff also put an end to Mezyk's annual paid weeklong vacations. To survive, Mezyk has moved in with a great-aunt and uncle until she can decide on her next move. iReport.com: Tell us what are you doing to survive bad economy? Industry leaders said Mezyk is just one of thousands of nannies who've been swallowed up by the shifting landscape in the U.S. child care industry, one that is affecting not just nannies, but baby sitters and day care centers as well. The economic booms during the late 1990s and from 2004 to 2007 made it possible for more middle-class and upper middle-class American families to employ nannies, said Genevieve Thiers, founder of Sittercity.com. ""Now that we're back in recession, families are unfortunately having to cut back on their nannies' hours or unfortunately having to let go of their nannies, and it's not a good situation."" In a poll of parents who use Sittercity.com, 17 percent said the economy is forcing them to end their time as a stay-at-home parent and return to work. Twenty-seven percent of the parents in the survey said the economy was forcing them to work more hours at their current jobs. ""Business is down a good 45 percent,"" said Jennifer Winter, 37, owner of Nannies in Miami, a nanny placement agency. ""The wealthy are still hanging on to their nannies, but the economy is forcing middle-class parents to make cuts."" Annie Davis, who launched Annie's Nannies Household Staffing in Seattle, Washington, in 1984, described the current recession as ""the weirdest time I think I've seen in my lifetime."" She's seen about 10 percent of her active nanny roster laid off since last October. ""There are nannies being laid off in families where both parents work and one parent has lost their job,"" said Candi Wingate of nannies4hire.com and babysitters4hire.com. Baby-sitting 'a godsend' in recession . The recession also is forcing more non-working parents in single-income families to take jobs outside the home. As a result, many formerly full-time nannies are taking what they can get -- which often are part-time child care positions, said Wingate. Katie Heath, 30, a self-employed health consultant and part-time baby sitter listed with Sitters to the Rescue in Indianapolis, Indiana, has been taking advantage of the increased demand to augment her income. ""I'm baby-sitting more than I'm working my regular job,"" Heath said, adding that she's caring for children between 12 to 16 hours a week, while devoting five hours weekly to her business. ""Baby-sitting is a godsend for me."" During a recession, said Thiers -- a self-described 30-year-old ""super-sitter"" -- ""everybody suddenly realizes, 'Wow, caregiving is a really great gig.' "" ""Increased numbers of recent college graduates are posting resumes on the Web site for jobs as nannies or baby sitters, because they're not finding full-time work in other fields,"" Thiers said. Not surprisingly, with a rising supply of available baby sitters, the pay rate is falling. The standard baby-sitting rate nationwide is $10 to $12 per hour, according to most agencies. This can drop by at least a dollar per hour in some markets, due to economic pressures. According to its survey, 26 percent of Sittercity.com's sitters and nannies said their pay has decreased from last summer. For full-time nannies, a typical Miami salary in past years was $700 per week, said Winter. ""Now they're getting more like $400."" In the two months since her layoff, Mezyk has been accepting baby-sitting jobs to survive -- working sporadically about 20 hours a week for various clients. ""It's nowhere near what I'm used to making,"" said Mezyk. ""Baby-sitting is not the same thing as being a nanny. It's not promised, it's not guaranteed. My goal is to have a steady income."" Many parents who have laid off their child care helpers find themselves wracked with guilt because they're getting rid of nannies they love, said Thiers. ""They're trying to move heaven and earth to get them a new position,"" she said, including using online chat rooms and message boards. Nanny sharing: Pros and cons . Agencies are touting the benefits of what's called nanny sharing, when two families share the talents of a single nanny. Nannies4hire.com, which boasts of helping more than 500,000 U.S. and Canadian families since 1987, said the addition of nanny sharing has boosted business by 15 percent. ""One family has the nanny for two days, the other has the nanny for three days,"" said Wingate. Nanny sharing might save a family as much as 30 percent on what an exclusive nanny might charge, she said. Nanny sharing has its drawbacks, including logistical problems, said Winter. ""What happens if the nanny gets sick? Different parents have different demands and both families suffer,"" she said. ""Nannies think it's too stressful and a lot of them won't do it."" Wingate agrees that nanny sharing can be complicated and said for this reason, good communication between the nanny and both families is critical. Faced with few employment options, Mezyk said she would consider a nanny-sharing situation, despite the idea of having more bosses. Her personal crisis has brought Mezyk's young career to a crossroads, as she considers pursuing a degree in pediatric nursing. Meanwhile, she still keeps in touch with her former employers and with little Landon and Delaney. ""I know the kids really enjoy me,"" she said. ""When the nanny leaves, it's really the kids that get hurt the most.""",0.7007619,2246
26,"MORROW, Georgia (CNN) -- Jobless for nearly a year, Michael Rivers was about to walk out of his house a few weeks ago to catch the bus for another daylong employment hunt when a radio announcement stopped him. With Ludacris at her side, single mom Joya Montgomery, 26, proudly displays keys to her car Sunday. ""This is Ludacris, and I'm giving away 20 free cars. ..."" The famous rapper was pulling an Oprah in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. The rapper announced that if listeners were able to pay the taxes, registration, tags and insurance, they should go to his nonprofit Ludacris Foundation Web site and write 300 words about why they deserved new wheels. ""And make it good,"" Luda warned.  Watch Ludacris talk about his ""stimulus"" plan » . Four thousand people took him up on his challenge, and in a few days, more than 2,000 essays poured into the Nissan South dealership in Morrow, Georgia, that had teamed with the rapper on the used-car giveaway.  See and hear the winners tell their stories » . Rivers' essay was among them. ""I didn't even wait; I just continued out that door to the community center, sat at a computer and let all my emotions come out,"" he said. Rivers described riding the city bus with his 14-year-old daughter to make sure she arrived safely at school and how he recently celebrated the small victory of getting his 17-year-old autistic son, who can't tolerate crowds, to stand calmly for a few moments outside the bus stop. He doesn't live near a grocery store so he has to bring home the food he can carry on the bus. Rivers was laid off from his job as a court clerk in the summer of 2008, and making job interviews on time isn't easy when the bus is often late. But on Sunday afternoon, Rivers was giddy, slightly bouncing as he spoke. He stood shoulder to shoulder among the 20 winners and their friends and families waiting to see their cars. ""I don't care what it is,"" Rivers said. ""I'm grateful for any car with four wheels because it beats two heels."" Winners received 30 days of free gas, which will be a big help to Joya Montgomery, a 26-year-old single parent of a 4-year-old, 8-year-old and 3-month-old. She has been waking before 5 a.m. and walking to the bus stop, while it's dark, with her children to begin a long journey to her job and to drop them off at school or a friend's home. ""It was scary at times,"" she said. ""You don't even know who's out there. I was always looking over my shoulder. ""I just can't believe I won. I'm real happy."" In the parking lot, the crowd was dancing. But the bass of Ludacris' latest single blasting from the dealership's loudspeakers was secondary inspiration for one Atlanta grandmother. Fifty-one-year-old Vermelle Jackson was so excited to have a 2005 Mercury Sable to drive around grandchildren, nieces and nephews that she swiveled her hips around and dipped it shockingly low to the ground. ""Lord Jesus. ... He brought this car to me, baby!"" she shouted, arms raised. ""This is God's work!"" Actually, the giveaway idea came from Chris White, the jovial, hand-shaking manager of Nissan South. ""I knew someone who knew someone who knew Luda and, you know, we just made it happen,"" White said. The concept seemed like a winner for everyone. Like many dealerships, Nissan South has not yet been reimbursed for the money it spent upfront during the federal government's Cash for Clunkers program that allowed customers to trade in older cars for $3,500 or $4,500 credit. When the popular program ended August 24, the car dealer didn't want to turn away customers who kept streaming in, expecting to get the same discounts. So Nissan South continued giving customers identical low rates and taking their used cars. The Cash for Clunkers program and the continued discounts totaled nearly $800,000 in the hole for the dealership, said owner Scott Smith. ""We're grateful for the Clunkers program because it really helped business, but it's a lot of money to be without,"" he said. At the end of the year, the cars given away under the Luda program, which were not technically acquired during the Clunkers program, may be eligible as charity tax write-offs. ""We like to think of it as not being about the write-offs,"" White said. ""It's more like we had a chance to do something positive in the community that is going through a really hard time right now."" White helped place a few radio spots and within two days, more than 2,000 essays had been sent in. That number quickly shot to close to 4,000. Ludacris and his mother, Roberta Shields, who directs his foundation and helped give away the cars Sunday, and the rapper's foundation staff of about a dozen helped read the essays. To validate the stories they found most compelling, they made phone calls and interviewed people who knew the finalists. ""We ended up calling a homeless shelter to reach one gentleman whose cell phone had gone out, and he was recharging it,"" Shields said. ""We didn't know if we'd get ahold of him, but we finally did. All he wanted was a car to help him go out for job interviews."" Ludacris was particularly moved by the story of a Sudanese refugee who has experienced every hardship imaginable, the least of which was a broken-down car. The two sat down Sunday and had a long talk. ""That's one of those stories that really had me like, man, I thought I had faced some adversities in life,"" the rapper said in a quiet moment away from the crowd. ""But I've not faced adversities at all compared to what he's been through. I cannot imagine going through what he's gone through and still be that strong."" Mading Duor, who escaped civil war and was providing for his four children on a school maintenance worker's salary, was crossing a street in Decatur, Georgia, when a driver ignored a crosswalk and hit and killed his 4-year-old son. Karen McCrea, who attends church with Duor, wrote the winning essay. ""I don't expect anyone to understand [what I have been through], but I know that people come to me with a good heart now,"" he said. ""I couldn't believe it when she called me to tell me. I said, 'You are kidding! It cannot be!' "" Neither McCrea, from Atlanta's affluent Buckhead area, nor Duor, neatly dressed in a shirt buttoned to the collar, seemed like Ludacris' demographic. They nodded their heads to his music anyway, smiling. ""Oh, I know his music, I know it, yes,"" Duor said. ""I will play it [in my car].""",0.6963817,8284
27,"Editor's note: This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles CNN is doing about economic survival in this time of financial crisis. Married couple Lindsay  De Vore and Eliot Kohan on their delayed honeymoon to Orlando, Florida. (CNN) -- At age 23 and fresh out of college, Eliot Kohan was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia. He was told he had four months to live. He survived. But the disease left him and his wife, Lindsay De Vore, who live in St. Paul, Minnesota, saddled with thousands of dollars of medical bills on top of their student loans and daily expenses. But their struggles taught them an important lesson in saving money. ""When you have medical issues, it's easy to spiral into some sort of depression,"" the 26-year-old a technology analyst for a private contracting company in St. Paul said. ""My goal was to keep moving forward. I wanted to create some stability for our us."" All of that hard work saving for the past few years has paid off. The couple is elated to be closing next month on their first home in St. Paul, thanks to the troubled economy. De Vore and Kohan first told their story on CNN's iReport.com. Share your economic survivor story with CNN. The timing couldn't have been better for the couple to purchase a modest three-bedroom, one-story stucco house. De Vore and Kohan locked into a historically low mortgage rate of 4.9 percent this month. The couple selected a foreclosed home, slashing nearly $20,000 off the final price. ""We wouldn't have been able to buy this house if the economy weren't the way it is,"" said De Vore, 25, who works in the financial aid office at a private college in St. Paul. ""We were in the perfect position."" There were more than 300,000 foreclosure filings reported nationwide in December, marking a 17 percent increase from the previous month and a 41 percent increase from December 2007, according to RealtyTrac, a foreclosure listing service. Meanwhile, unemployment continues to climb to rates unseen in decades. Yet the rocky economy is having a positive effect on some Americans, who are finding it the ideal time to buy a home. Similar to many married couples, Kohan and De Vore envisioned owning a house perhaps two or three years down the road, they say. Soon the couple says they noticed interest rates and home prices dipping so low that they found themselves nabbing a home as soon as they could afford the down payment. But the couple's ability to afford their first home is a story about fiscal responsibility, patience and determination. De Vore and Kohan, who met in their freshman year at St. Paul's Hamline University in 2002, moved into a two-bedroom apartment during their last year of college. For the past five years, they have remained in the same collegiate apartment, furnished with Craigslist finds and family hand-me-downs. ""Money was a reason we've stayed here so long,"" Kohan said last week, bundled up with his wife because their apartment's heater broke. ""But at a certain point, we felt like we were growing out of it in more ways than just physically. We wanted a change of pace."" The couple says they've always been tight with money, keeping credit card usage limited to emergencies and being picky about what they spend their money on. But they became more ""money-conscious"" in June 2006, when Kohan was diagnosed with leukemia. He needed a costly stem cell transplant, and the couple did not have enough money. The sickness was evident in his frail face and bruised body. Luckily, when he went on leave from his job, his employers offered to hold his position until he recovered. Back in his hometown of Fergus Falls, a small city in western Minnesota, Kohan's family and friends threw a benefit, raising $12,000 toward the costly medical bills. He soon recovered, but the experience forced him to refocus his goals in life, including buying a house.. The couple began saving in small ways. They bring their lunch to work and eat out only once or twice a month. They cut extra expenses that many couples in their 20s enjoy, such as nights at bars with friends and date nights to the movie theater. To save on gas money, Kohan takes public transportation, a 45-minute bus ride each way, to downtown Minneapolis for work. ""The house was a big motivation,"" says De Vore, who tracks their expenses meticulously each month. When the couple married a year after his leukemia diagnosis, she opted for a small, intimate wedding. That helped cut costs too, she said. They waited nearly nine months before heading on their honeymoon trip. Instead of a grand trip abroad, they settled for a smaller trip to Orlando, Florida. Knowing that higher education would help her earn more, De Vore is taking night classes to earn her master's degree in student affairs. Her tuition is free because she chose to attend the university where she works. By December, the couple began to realize all the saving had amounted to a down payment on a home. They wanted to invest in a home for at least 10 years, they say, so they can try to build equity. De Vore found the home through a real estate agent on her lunch break one afternoon in early January. It was ""nothing fancy,"" she says, but the 1960s ranch-style house had a spacious kitchen and a small yard with enough space for a dog that they want. She knew instantly that it would be their new home, she says. ""We worked hard. We didn't cut corners,"" she said. ""We did everything we did to get here, and it's worth it, to our opinion.""",0.6961768,2994
28,"(CNN) -- Cheryl Bradshaw shivered under a big brown coat as she made her way through a line of people waiting along an icy road in Wilmington, Ohio. She was among about 5,000 residents who accepted food from the nonprofit Feed the Children. The nonprofit Feed the Children delivers boxes of food and other items to families Thursday in Wilmington, Ohio. ""A lot of this people in this town ... it's day to day, dollar to dollar,"" Bradshaw said of the town of about 12,000 between Cincinnati and Columbus. Wilmington is still reeling from news that delivery giant DHL would close its hub there. About 3,000 of the 8,000 people who faced layoffs lived in or around Wilmington. One in three families in Wilmington had someone employed at DHL, according to an economic task force created by Mayor David Raizk. A crowd gathered Thursday as 12 loaded semitrailers cautiously parked on slippery roads. Each family got two boxes. One had 25 pounds of canned food and vegetables. Another contained 10 pounds of personal care items.  Watch as townspeople describe tough times » . Bradshaw said she appreciated the help. She got laid off in December from ABX Air, a Wilmington-based air cargo services company that worked with DHL. ""We are raising two grandkids, and we only have one income, so it's a big, big blessing,"" she said. Tony Sellars, the nonprofit's director of communications, said, ""This is the largest distribution we have had in such a small town."" Sellars said the organization is monitoring layoff conditions in various cities and identifying critical locations where it can be of assistance. ""We have been around since 1979, and this is unprecedented in terms of need,"" Sellars said. ""In Wilmington, the residents are proud and confused; they are resilient and trying to solve their problems on their own, but they don't know where to turn."" Feed the Children distributed the food and other items in conjunction with partners that include Avon Products and the local Sugartree Ministry Center. Larry Jones, founder and president of Feed the Children, urged communities to reach out to one another. ""If we are going to solve the problem, it's not going to be the government; it's going to be churches and charities and colleges, literally everyone working together,"" Jones said. ""We are not the total answer, but we are part of the answer, and hopefully when people see us doing what we are doing, they will join in to help."" Ohio is facing one of the highest jobless rates in the country -- 7.8 percent in December. The nation's unemployment rate is 7.6 percent. DHL's decision to close its hub in Wilmington has had a ripple effect. Sharon Testa, 48, who owns the Mediterranean Restaurant in downtown, has lived in Wilmington for 20 years. ""Our business opened two years ago because we had a lot of international people coming in to work for DHL or companies affiliated with them,"" Testa said. ""Everyone is concerned. We don't want our city to shrivel up; people who still have jobs are trying to come in to keep the business running."" Helen Keech, 50, who works at the Arby's near where DHL was located, said that the restaurant used to open early for the DHL employees. She said there were many businesses in that building, including ABX and DHL, and now that there are less employees, things will change. ""It's gonna be a ghost town I can tell you that,"" Keech said.

29,"WEST POINT, Georgia (CNN) -- A community that seemed on the road to becoming a ghost town has taken a turn toward prosperity despite the recession, thanks to an automaker. A roadside sign in West Point, Georgia, expresses support for Kia's new factory. Korean car manufacturer Kia plans to open a sprawling automobile factory in tiny West Point, Georgia, by the end of the year. The boon has already spurred economic growth -- and just plain excitement -- among residents, said Mayor Drew Ferguson. ""We jokingly call it Kia-ville,"" said Ferguson, a 42-year-old dentist helping to oversee expansion of West Point, population 3,500. The announcement is drawing workers and businesses to the community about 80 miles south of Atlanta. ""The revitalization of the community is touching every aspect,"" Ferguson said. ""We have infrastructure projects, new subdivisions going up, hotel professional services that are all needed to support the massive manufacturing."" The plant, which will make Kia's Sorento sport utility vehicle, has hired 500 workers. By the time the factory opens, Kia hopes to hire 2,000 more. A smattering of Kia supply companies will eventually employ 7,500 additional workers.  Watch the town's excitement about the new factory » . ""A lot of people feel that we are the savior for this area, which I hope we will be,"" said Randy Jackson, director of human resources for the manufacturing plant. ""We got 43,013 applications; 75 percent of those applications came from Georgia, and about 20 percent came from our neighboring state of Alabama."" Some of those applications are coming from auto workers around the country, including Detroit, Michigan, Jackson said. Overall, West Point stands to gain 20,000 jobs as a result of the factory during the next five years, Ferguson said. Georgia's 9.7 percent unemployment rate reported in May is about the same as the June national average of 9.5 percent, according to federal statistics. The U.S. Department of Labor reported unemployment in a five-county region including West Point at 8.6 percent. To secure the $1.2 billion Kia plant, state and local officials helped assemble land from a former cattle farm to create a 2,200-acre industrial park. They also locked in about $400 million in tax breaks and other economic incentives. ""We think the investment will pay off big time,"" Ferguson said. ""We're already seeing it. But it's not only in the dollars, but in the hope and opportunity, and the ability to create new jobs."" Ruthann Williams invested her life savings to buy and open the Irish Bred Pub on West Point's Main Street. Now she commutes to work 45 minutes a day from her North Georgia home. ""I came here because of Kia,"" Williams said. ""We jumped in with both feet and have not looked back one time."" 'My little town was gonna die' Plans for the new factory have transformed a community that during the past ten years has been becoming a ghost town. Textile mills that once defined West Point shut down in the 1990s, leaving many out of work. Debbie Williams, co-owner of the popular Roger's Bar-B-Que, was worried her business would go under. ""We'd go downtown and there was nothing there,"" Williams said. ""I thought my little town was gonna die."" Margaret McManus was laid off last year when the textile mill she worked for closed. The 52-year-old went back to school to study information technology. In April she landed a job as a trainer with Daehan Solutions Georgia, a parts supplier for Kia. McManus said she didn't think in a million years she'd be making car parts. ""The job that I used to do for a long time, we thought we'd retire there,"" McManus said. ""It feels good to go to work everyday and have something to do."" The signs of transformation in West Point are everywhere. There's new construction, including the city's first new subdivision in 25 years. And businesses that once struggled are feeling the uptick. Williams recently replaced her restaurant floor because of all the new foot traffic. ""We see a lot of people we don't know now. They want to see where the Kia site's gonna be built,"" Williams said. ""We always say if we can get them in here one time, we can get them back, and they come. They're coming back."" Tom Oswald, owner of West Point Shoe Outlet, said last year was his best year ever. ""Once Kia announced they were opening we've sold mostly steel-toed shoes for construction workers,"" he said. ""Now we're selling wingtips for men and heels for ladies."" And Malcolm Malone, who runs M&M Car Wash, said business is booming. ""It's been up at least 70 percent,"" said the 44-year-old West Point native. ""It's like Christmas."" Or perhaps a little divine intervention deserves credit, as a West Point sign pointed out: ""Thank You Jesus For Bringing Kia to Our Town."" New flavors . On Main Street, residents are sampling new flavors that have come to West Point since the announcement. Asian restaurants and businesses are popping up. The old Pizza Hut has transformed into a Korean Bar-B-Que, and the southern staple KFC is now a popular Korean eatery called Young's Garden. Resident Christy Magbee said West Point is starting to feel like a melting pot. ""You got the culture coming in. You don't have to travel to Atlanta anymore. It's starting to come here,"" she said. ""The old downtown is new again. It's an exciting time,"" Ferguson said. ""For us there's a light at the end of the tunnel."" CNN's Alina Cho contributed to this report.",0.68653333,6459
30,"Marietta, Georgia (CNN) -- In this tough economy, a steady paycheck is a big blessing. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Americans are finding new ways to help each other out. For many, it's through their faith. ""We did say our prayers,"" Patricia Mulroney said. ""I pray to St. Joseph even now. He is our patron of workers. I still pray to him every day."" Yet believers like Mulroney are doing more than praying. They're getting help in their job searches from houses of worship. And religious institutions are answering the call: Houses of worship nationwide have offered job-finding help. Mulroney has looked for help in finding a job through a network created at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Marietta, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. The church has reviewed résumés and arranged meetings between job-seekers and company representatives. It also has hosted speakers who have discussed financial planning and interview techniques. Similar programs have received attention in places such as Arizona, California and Michigan. St. Joseph's started helping unemployed members last year after a priest contacted Art Eyzaguierre, a parishioner with a background in career management. Eyzaguierre says the priest told him, ""we've been getting a lot of phone calls from people that are unemployed and really hurting ... and we'd like you to come to a council meeting to talk about what we should do."" By May of last year, St. Joseph's Career Community Network was born. ""When you're helping people ... they're getting what they need,"" Eyzaguierre said. ""They're getting jobs, the hope they need. ... I feel replenished."" Patrick Brennan, another founding member, found himself out of work in the early part of 2009. His involvement with the Career Community Network paid off, literally, with a job. ""It's through these different networking opportunities ... through your churches ... you get to meet people ... and potentially get positions,"" Brennan said. ""That happened to me, where I was networking and actually found a position ... as a result of meeting people through the career network."" Brennan says church-based career networks like his reach out in both a spiritual and practical sense for the unemployed, the under-employed and those seeking to re-enter the work force. ""We offer review of résumés ... the opportunity to meet with department leaders or heads of companies ... discuss with them where individual career goals can go,"" he said. ""We also have featured speakers who help with financial planning, retirement funds, health benefits and also interviewing techniques ... looking at different market shares."" Caroline Rittenhouse helps organize biweekly sessions. When she signed on, Rittenhouse was a stay-at-home mom looking to re-enter the work force. She's now employed and using her job skills in training and instructional design to help others find work. ""My motivation was seeing how tough the job market was and how many people across every industry, every income level, were feeling the job loss and the unemployment situation,"" Rittenhouse said. She says networking opportunities, like those offered through St. Joseph's Career Community Network, are key, and houses of worship may offer a more comfortable environment. ""There is something about going to a church,"" Rittenhouse said. ""Personally, I feel like it's more welcoming."" Americans overwhelmingly support government funding for religious groups to provide social services like job training. Nearly nine years after former President George W. Bush unveiled his faith-based initiative, 69 percent of Americans say they favor the idea, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Sixty-eight percent believe that people providing the services through houses of worship would be more caring and compassionate. Mulroney not only supports the idea, she got involved a few months ago at St. Joseph's as both a volunteer and a job seeker. ""My last position, I was in for seven years and not really comfortable with networking, so I thought the church would be a great place to start ... and get contacts to possibly help me find employment,"" Mulroney said. Since then, Mulroney has moved to Florida. She says she's taking the hope, faith and job skills St. Joseph's Career Community Network provided and will probably join another job networking group at a local church, in her ongoing search for a steady paycheck.",0.6857352,9112
31,"This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles by CNN about economic survival in this time of financial crisis. Leah Bird and her husband Ed Wright stand in front of their new home: a 1974 Airstream trailer. (CNN) -- They bid farewell to their beloved trips to the opera and museum, the beach and Buddhist temples. They ate one last time at their favorite restaurants serving Indian curried chicken and warm bowls of Vietnamese pho. Leah Bird and her husband, Ed Wright, have traded their comfortable two-bedroom apartment and jobs in Beverly Hills, California, for life in a trailer on a five-acre Oregon farm. No longer do the couple hear roaring fire trucks in the street or chatter from patrons dining at outdoor cafes. On this farm, the dominant silence is occasionally interrupted by the sounds of frogs and crickets. ""It's not necessarily a lifestyle that has ever seemed attractive to me,"" says 28-year-old Bird, between tending to the farm animals: two sheep, two Nubian goats, miniature horses and geese. ""I always saw myself as more of a metropolitan person, but you know, without money, this was our best option."" The couple's drastic lifestyle change -- one they chose -- came last October when Wright, 48, lost his job managing life insurance portfolios for millionaires at a private firm in Beverly Hills. His niche company, which relied heavily on capital flow, had felt the pain of the credit crunch. Once making over $100,000 a year, Wright soon joined the growing number of Americans facing unemployment in the economic downturn. iReport.com: Tell us how you're surviving . With meager savings, Bird and Wright knew they couldn't maintain their costly Los Angeles lifestyle in an area where, they say, image is everything. Even if they had stayed in Beverly Hills, they would have needed to move into a smaller apartment and rely on Bird's modest salary as a financial manager. Exhausted from the rat race, Wright decided they needed another option. ""I've been in Los Angeles for a long time and I've had to start over before,"" Wright says. ""You spend two or three years getting back on your feet and then what? It's a struggle if you aren't making a lot of money."" Then Wright's parents offered to let the newlywed couple live on their family farm in rural Douglas County in southern Oregon until the couple bounced back. Wright agreed immediately. He says he wanted to move there to help his elderly parents manage the sprawling property. His wife, however, was more reluctant because she still had her job. But Bird says she soon agreed to move to the farm because it was the fastest way to cut expenses. ""I did it out of immediate necessity,"" says Bird, who grew up in more of a suburban setting near Tucson, Arizona. ""I don't think I was ready to leave L.A."" While Wright wanted to make the move north, he wasn't ready to move in with his parents. At Christmas, the couple purchased a 1974 Airstream trailer, shaped like an oblong silver bullet, from Craigslist for a few thousand dollars. The trailer living quarters are cramped, with about 300 square feet, a major downgrade from the couple's 1,400-square-foot apartment in California. iReport.com: From Beverly Hills to Hillbillies . The couple moved to Oregon in mid-January, after a two-day drive from Los Angeles, hopeful the farm would give them the needed break from city life and a chance to focus on finding new careers. In Los Angeles, they lived in a neighborhood with about 20,000 people. Now, the closest town has fewer than 20,000 people. ""We're not going to lie to you and say everything is hunky dory,"" Wright says. ""It's hard being out here."" ""I feel like a fish out of water,"" Bird added. ""I'm so out of my element."" Their mornings now begin at the crack of dawn. They clean the living space for the animals, pick up manure and fix the landscaping. Afternoons are spent job hunting, a challenging feat in a region where lumber and nursing are the two dominant fields. For now, they are spending their savings until they find employment. Their trailer's bedroom has just enough room to stuff in a queen-size bed. A narrow window by the bed looks out on the farm, where they can see deer roaming the land in the mornings. There is no dining room, a difficult adjustment for the couple, who once enjoyed entertaining guests over dinner and wine. The living room furniture consists of colorful pillows piled against the wall on the floor facing the television and a desk for their laptops. Their new kitchen has just enough space for one person to stand and work. There is one toilet , which is currently being remodeled, and no shower. The couple bathe at Wright's parents' house; they admit that they only shower a few times a week now. Most of their belongings from Los Angeles, expensive furniture and art accumulated over the years, remain in storage. While the couple miss these things, they say their new lifestyle will help them survive the troubled economy. They also hope it will teach them to live simpler lives. In many ways, Bird and Wright are enjoying the serenity of their slower-paced lifestyle. They are spending more time together, and Bird says she is getting closer to Wright's parents. After the initial culture shock in the first month, Bird says she is slowly adapting to farm life. She learned how to build a fire pit, and she plans on growing a fruit and vegetable garden in the spring. She wants to buy more productive animals like cows. With the garden and some cows, she says, the couple won't have to purchase vegetables or milk from the grocery store. Her husband is remodeling their trailer by adding amenities to the kitchen and bathroom. Wright, who has always been interested in philosophy and religion, says he sees his unemployment as a time for ""soul searching."" The couple are still mulling their career options. Wright, who is also an amateur musician, is looking at new job opportunities for the future. He has dabbled with the idea of starting his own bar since he knows so many musicians in the industry, he says. He and his wife are thinking about joining the Peace Corps together, or maybe building a log house on the farm. The options are limitless, they say. A few weeks ago, surrounded by giant pine trees in the cold winter air, the couple walked outside and looked up. For the first time in a long time, they could see the stars shining brightly in the dark sky. CNN's Shirley Zilberstein contributed to this report.",0.6825041,2305
32,"(CNN) -- It may have a fairy tale ending -- a story of perseverance and second chances that's playing out live on the public stage of online networking. Brianna Karp's trailer now sits outside a friend's home near Los Angeles . But 24-year-old Brianna Karp's story started as a nightmare. In a rocky economy, Karp was laid off from her Irvine, California, job as an executive assistant in July 2008. She got by for a while on temp jobs and unemployment benefits. But when her savings dried up, she was no longer able to afford her rent. The only answer she saw then was a trailer she'd inherited from her father -- a man she barely knew who had recently committed suicide. ""I was left with a truck and this camper, which I was going to sell but coincidentally this happened to me,"" she said. ""I thought, 'Well, I have this.' "" Karp, who writes that she is also estranged from her mother, ended up camped in a Los Angeles-area Walmart parking lot. ""The first night, I think, in the Walmart parking lot was the scariest,"" she told CNN. ""I was panicking, and I was just afraid."" For comfort, she had her mastiff named Fezzik. And she had her laptop computer. As she spent five months looking for jobs and blasting out resumes, often spending hour after hour at a coffee shop to take advantage of its free Wi-Fi connection, she also started blogging. The result, the Girl's Guide to Homelessness, chronicled the ups and downs of her new life. She reminisced about adopting her dog, named for a character from the movie ""The Princess Bride,"" and mulled the pros and cons of having a pet while homeless. She recounted details from failed job interviews and offered tips for other homeless women. ""I was trying to stay positive and cheerful,"" Karp said. ""I started writing the blog in a tongue-in-cheek way to kind of laugh about my circumstances, keep them chronicled. I didn't think anyone would actually read it.""  Watch CNN's Ted Rowland's report on Brianna. » . But people did, including Matt Barnes, formerly homeless himself and running a Web site about his own homelessness issues in Scotland. He asked her to write for his site and would eventually become Brianna's boyfriend. Another big break came through a shot at the weird world of reality television. Karp applied for a show that would offer contestants the chance at a job with Elle magazine advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. She was granted an audition for the show and, by her own account, totally botched it. ""I went back and blogged about bombing the interview and made fun of myself,"" she said. On a lark, she then wrote to Carroll via her column. ""Dear E. Jean: I'm currently homeless and living in a Wal-Mart parking lot,"" her e-mail began. ""I'm educated, I have never done drugs and I'm not mentally ill. I have a strong employment history and am a career executive assistant. The instability sucks, but I'm rocking it as best as I can."" She told Carroll about her poor interview for the show and finished the note with the question, ""How does one get another shot when one screws up a job interview? -- Homeless, but Not Hopeless."" Carroll said she was floored by the note. ""[The phrase] 'I'm living in a Walmart parking lot' hooked me,"" she said. ""I thought, she's so ready to work, obviously she can write, she's got some skills."" Her response appeared in the August issue of Elle -- she offered Karp an internship and a chance to write a fashion blog for the magazine. ""I think she's a new voice,"" Carroll said. ""She's a voice we haven't heard, and I'm excited for her future."" Not that all of her troubles were instantly over. Last month, she wrote, Walmart finally had her trailer towed, and she has now parked her mobile home at a friend's house outside Los Angeles. She's also still seeking that elusive full-time job, while hoping her newfound high profile will help spread the word about homelessness, and how it can happen to the most unlikely people. ""If you saw me walking down the street, you wouldn't assume I live in a parking lot,"" she writes on the blog.

And that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood. ""We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,"" says Heywood. MR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops. ""We're trying to thrive, not just survive,"" Heywood said. MR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network. ""We looked at our social lives, and we had black friends, Asian friends, Latino friends, white friends. We would do a lot of things socially together, but when it came to getting our hair cut, we would all split up,"" Walker says.  Watch Walker talk about the difficulty of starting and running a business » . The two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track. Among other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly. ""We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,"" Walker says. Giving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago. ""All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,"" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago. Imagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area. That was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921. But on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. ""People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' "" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. ""We evacuated. They were destroying everything."" The death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials. The riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered. ""It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,"" says Walker. Wess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, ""We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box."" His advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it. ""Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,"" Young says. Walker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him. ""I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,"" he says. ""I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.""",0.67863756,5322
34,"(CNN) -- For anyone yearning to forget about the recession by escaping to a tropical paradise or relaxing on a cruise, finding great travel deals right now isn't hard. Deciding whether to take advantage of them is another matter. Katie Parker and her husband, Damon Fodge, are going to India soon, but she had second thoughts about the trip. For many Americans, spending money on a getaway may not be a priority, a possibility -- or even the right thing to do -- amid thousands of layoffs, plunging home prices and shrinking portfolios. The general misery is even causing some who can afford a big trip to stay put. Take ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Brian Williams, who told the blog TVNewser this month that he and his family would skip a vacation in 2009 because it wouldn't seem appropriate during a time of hardship for so many people. ""We were going to try to get away, but it didn't feel right this year,"" Williams told the blog. Other Americans are jetting off, but they're having lots of second thoughts and are watching their wallets closely. Katie Parker, a Web designer who lives in Washington, is going to India next month to meet her husband on the last leg of his international business trip. Parker, 33, said she's excited about the vacation but apprehensive about spending $1,600 for her plane ticket in addition to lodging costs and other expenses during the two-week stay. ""Although I think my job is probably safe, you never really know,"" Parker said. ""Part of me thinks maybe we should have waited on this trip."" She added, ""But I also feel like it's a once in a lifetime thing. I don't know when I'm going to get another chance to go to India so we're just going to do it."" Parker and her husband, Damon Fodge, are usually frugal while traveling, staying in hostels and other inexpensive lodgings, she said, but they will be especially careful about spending money during this journey. Parker recalled feeling devastated after a layoff several years ago and said the possibility that it might happen again would be on her mind. Fear factor . The fear over what could happen is causing many people to put their lives on hold and hunker down because they don't feel in control, said Nancy Molitor, a clinical psychologist who practices in suburban Chicago, Illinois. ""There's a huge psychological component to any recession and this one, I think, in particular ... because it's gone on for so long,"" Molitor said. ""Anxiety is contagious."" She also has heard from patients and friends who are affluent but who feel embarrassed about spending a lot of money on travel right now. Some have ""survivor's guilt"" and are downplaying their vacations instead of feeling excited about them, Molitor said. Brian Morton, a manager at a movie studio in Los Angeles, California, said talking about his travel plans with friends who are already unemployed -- and for whom travel is out of the question -- can be uncomfortable. ""You don't want to seem like you're bragging,"" he said. Morton, 37, is planning to spend at least $3,500 on a weeklong trip to Aruba this summer, even though there have been layoffs in his industry and he's not entirely sure his job is safe. ""I don't think I'm going to stop vacationing just because of the recession,"" he said. ""[But] I scrutinize my budget a little bit more. ...

For sea lovers, cruises are among of the best values this year, Shaw Brown said, though she urged people to consider the additional money they might have to spend on shore excursions, alcohol and other extras. Depending on where you go, the current travel discounts and incentives can mean that a vacation that might have cost $4,000 a year ago now costs $2,500, said Rey Alton, leisure marketing director at Travel Leaders/Almeda Travel in Houston, Texas. ""Some people say, 'I'm going to have to hold off until next year or maybe the year afterward,' but [those who want to travel now] are really the ones who are finding deals,"" he said. Mexico and the Caribbean are the biggest destinations on sale right now, he added. Molitor urged people to be mindful of their budgets but to try to avoid thinking they're stuck and have no options. ""If they get away to a vacation that they could afford, that could be very good for them,"" Molitor said. ""Some people are so down that they're missing opportunities.""",0.6739403,1823
35,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Summer excursions seem out of reach to many struggling young professionals, and the faltering economy isn't helping. But one New York City company, offering trips aimed at the young and thrifty, is capitalizing on the urbanite's desire to get away -- and finding success despite the downturn. A group of Urban Escapes NYC hikers stops for a snack during an expedition in New York's Harriman State Park. As a slightly broke young professional myself, with a taste for adventure but living in a very expensive city, the idea behind Urban Escapes NYC was intriguing. The company offers an array of activities -- from short hiking, sky diving or canoeing trips to international journeys that combine various activities. On the company's user-friendly Web site, I scrolled through the offerings. There were trips ranging from one-day hiking or fruit-picking excursions priced at around $60 to $800 weeklong international expeditions. The average trip includes ground transportation, the cost of the activity, guide fees, equipment rental and meals. Jumping out of planes put the company's founder and CEO, Maia Josebachvili, 25, on the path to becoming a business owner. While attending Dartmouth College, Josebachvili developed a passion for sky diving. To pay for the pricey dives, she began to lead trips for her friends and her friends' friends. Soon she realized that the people she was guiding were outside of her original social network, and an idea began to emerge. After graduating from Dartmouth and working as a trader on the New York Stock Exchange, Josebachvili decided working in the concrete jungle was not for her. At 24, Josebachvili started a business out of something she had been doing for years during college -- leading outdoor adventure trips. The company launched in early 2008, just months before the economy tanked. ""I started to wonder if this is really going to work,"" Josebachvili said. But with trips designed with budget and value in mind, the suffering economy did not stunt the business. Josebachvili said the company was able to break even within six months. The business relies on social networking avenues for promotion, and word spread rapidly. It also quickly developed a reputation as a great way to meet people and make new friends. ""I was the market,"" Josebachvili explains, ""My friends were the market. Anyone just out of college working on Wall Street didn't have the time to plan and research the trips. There is no shortage of those kinds of people in New York."" After perusing the site, I rather nervously picked a $59 six-mile hike. This may not sound so cheap, but after factoring in the planning of the trip, transportation, gas, experienced guides and a post-hike discount at a local restaurant, the value becomes apparent. I hadn't been hiking in years and still am sadly out of shape. My imagination ran wild with images of young, sporty folks racing up high peaks as I huffed and puffed behind. Terrifying. After a rainy start to the morning, our upbeat guides for the day, director Bram Levy and guide Roget Lerner, drove a group of 12 north of the city to Harriman State Park. They encouraged us to get to know each other and joked that we would be quizzed on it later. Waiting to get into the van, I asked a man standing next to me why he was on the trip. ""I moved from San Francisco a year ago,"" public relations professional Michael Lindenberger said. ""I need some trees."" After an hourlong drive, we arrived at our hiking destination. Levy and Lerner checked our sneakers, water supply and told us a bit about how the day was going to unfold. And then we began the hike. Throughout the day, there was lots of laughing, squealing and helping each other over rocks and through slick patches of mud. I was surprised how quickly a team mentally developed among the group. We were all strangers, but after a day of hiking, I knew everyone's name, profession and a good deal more. And this was no accident -- the guides were deliberately networking and bonding us together. Jen Badali, a city transit planner, was on her third trip with Urban Escapes. ""I went by myself my first hike,"" she said. ""It was fun to get away and do something different."" She said she still keeps in touch with people she met on the other excursions. ""I made some good friends out of it,"" she said. At the end of the day, sweaty, sore and smiling, I realized why Urban Escapes NYC was defying the recession. With a plethora of affordable outdoor excursions, cheerful guides and a youthful mindset, the company was the ideal destination for an urban professional with a slim wallet.",0.6628226,4963
36,"Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, All Platform Journalist Jim Spellman reports from Denver, Colorado. Hari Dallakoti says business at his UPS store in Denver, Colorado, is down 25 percent. DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- The conventional wisdom here in the Mile High City is that Denver entered the recession early and is pulling out of it ahead of the rest of the country. Time and again I have heard politicians, journalists and business people tell me that it isn't so bad here, that Denver is poised to lead the nation in an economic recovery. Maybe, but the signs on the ground are a little harder to read. Down on Broadway I stop by a UPS store a couple of times a week. The owner's name is Hari Dallakoti. Dallakoti always has a smile on his face and seems to know all his customers by name -- he was calling out to me by the second time I entered the shop. People drop by to ship out packages, make copies and pick up deliveries. There is always a crowd when I have been in, but Dallakoti tells me business is down 25 percent this month versus the same time last year. ""Finally it's hitting in this area, and I believe that people are afraid of spending money,"" he says. ""It's like a ripple effect, and I think I am feeling it now."" Dallakoti says customers who once sent birthday presents across the country are now only sending cards. Also, eBay-related shipping is down, and he has seen a falloff in people sending mortgage-related documents. He has five employees and says he hasn't had to let anyone go, but he has had to cut back their hours. He agrees that business is better in Denver than in other parts of the country and is confident he will weather the economic storm, but it may be a while before things get better for him. ""In my opinion it's going to get worse for the next couple, three months, and I'm hoping it will turn around after June,"" he says.  Watch how the downturn is affecting Denver » . A block up Broadway is a little guitar store called Music Gear Guys. I play guitar, and this was one of the first businesses I stopped by when I moved to Denver in January. I have been in the shop four or five times and have been surprised that every time I drop by, the place is packed. ""The recession affected us a little last year but overall -- knock on wood -- it hasn't really affected me too much,"" says owner Gregory Decker, who thinks the recession may actually be helping his business. ""I have a feeling that people are looking for hobbies or different forms of entertainment that aren't too expensive,"" Decker explains. His store is crowded with new and used guitars, amplifiers and accessories. He says guitars based on designs from the 1960s are the hot items in the store. Like Dallakoti, the UPS store owner, Decker seems to know all of his customers by name. He says that in this economy you have to focus on customer service to stand a chance. He doesn't advertise, instead relying on word of mouth, and keeps overhead low: He is the sole employee. ""Relationships are what make my business thrive. Without them I wouldn't be as successful,"" he says. But even here in a relatively successful small business there are signs of the hard times other people have been experiencing. Beginning last year more customers started coming in to sell Decker their guitars in hopes of making ends meet. ""A lot of people are selling their gear due to job layoffs and needed the money,"" he says. The recession started with free-falling housing values and, in this respect, the signs are harder to read. Over the weekend I took my dog for a walk through my neighborhood near Sloans Lake in Northwest Denver and decided to count how many houses were for sale. In a six-block walk, I counted two houses for rent and 13 for sale, including the house next door to me. These homes sit like ghosts in the neighborhood. There are open houses on Sundays, but few people come by. The houses are all well-maintained, though most of them appear to be empty. My neighbors hope these places don't fall into foreclosure; they are worried the neighborhood will fall apart if they do. I'll be keeping my eye on the house next door, and keeping my fingers crossed that my new hometown will be back on track soon.",0.6624529,1876
37,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Jennifer Thomas was looking at life with renewed energy: She had just survived a serious operation, and she was at a crossroads in her career. After 20 years as a producer in the stressful business of TV news, the challenge wasn't there for her anymore. For eight weeks, as she recovered from the removal of a large noncancerous tumor from her uterus, Thomas thought about her next steps. ""I told myself I was going to work to do the things that I enjoy, things that are related to the news,"" she said. Thomas had recently conducted news production workshops for kids, so she already knew that she ""loved people and talking to people about the news. That made me start thinking that if I could do it all the time and get paid for it, I'd really enjoy it."" Within a year, Thomas had left her job at CNN's HLN network to start a Georgia-based media consulting business with clients such as singer/actress Jennifer Holliday, former Bell Biv DeVoe singer Ron DeVoe, actor Boris Kodjoe, actress Nicole Ari Parker and former supermodel Beverly Johnson. During her journey, Thomas learned that working for yourself often requires scary first steps, generous friends and mentors, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. She's the first to say that her story is not typical in any way, as she seemed to meet good luck at every turn. After her surgery, Thomas, who also had worked at CNN and NBC, began saving money and planning her business. As if on cue, HLN offered her a buyout to leave the company as part of a downsizing. ""It was my light bulb 'a-ha' moment,"" Thomas said. ""I was excited because in the back of my mind, it was what I had been praying for."" An opportunity to write a blog for a popular local women's magazine got her some local attention. A journalist friend e-mailed Thomas, saying that he had connected with Johnson and suggesting that they meet. ""She called out of the blue,"" Thomas said. "" 'Hi, Jennifer! It's Beverly -- the model!' I was shocked."" Johnson needed no introduction. Thomas was very familiar with the first African-American model to win a cover on American Vogue magazine. In that year, 1974, Thomas said Johnson's beauty and status spoke volumes to her as a role model. ""When she called, I was like, 'shut up!' We were all like, 'no way!' I didn't think anything would come from it, but eventually, she said she would love to be my client."" Thomas made short work of helping Johnson successfully pitch her women's health campaign to CNN, NBC and ABC. ""It was huge for me,"" Thomas said. ""It showed me that the skills I may have taken for granted were very valuable to others. Here I was doing what just came natural to me -- working with the media -- and I'm helping an iconic figure. It gave me such a feeling of gratification, and it gave me so much more confidence."" But snagging Johnson as her first client wasn't easy. She had to start with smaller steps -- and the first step was a doozy: dealing with the fear. ""For me, it was fear of failure,"" she said. ""Anyone who has worked with me knows I am driven to succeed, and failure is not an option."" ""But I'm a woman of faith,"" said Thomas, a preacher's daughter with strong ties to her church. ""Friends told me that 'faith will give you the wings to fly when you jump off that cliff.' "" One way new consultants can boost their confidence is by compiling a list of experience and skills they've gained during the past five years -- including successful projects, implementations and innovations. Experts recommend referring to that list whenever confidence dips. Thomas said she chose an area of consulting that was based on what she enjoys. ""Ask yourself, 'What would I do if I had to work for free?' "" she says. Another tip: Find a mentor. ""Identify someone who's successful and ask for practical advice,"" she says. ""I found my mentor at my church."" Set aside time and money for a vacation, and guard it like gold, Thomas advises. Also, she says, determine how much income you need to stay afloat each month, and focus on that target like a laser. To be safe, experts advise aspiring consultants to start small, as a side business, while continuing to work elsewhere full time. But during a recession, keeping a full-time job and easing into consulting work isn't always possible. Unemployment has prompted many experienced professionals to launch consultant operations simply to survive. ""With the way the market has gone recently, there's no shortage of people who are now saying that they're consultants -- and many of them are not qualified to be consultants,"" said Les Rubenovitch, president of Toronto-based Winning Edge Consultants Inc. ""Working for a company as an employee is very different from working for a company as a consultant. The credibility factor is critical if someone is going to engage you."" Those looking to quickly build credibility or credentials to accompany work experience may consider offering to do speaking engagements at a local college or university. Thomas showed her initiative by teaching herself to organize and lead an online seminar -- a Webinar -- aimed at showing doctors how to better communicate on TV. Financial planning is key to the success of a new consultant operation, according to experts. Thomas set aside savings to live on during the initial phase of her business. It took well into her first year for her business income to fully support her, Thomas says. That's better than most new consultant businesses, experts say. It's not unusual for new consultant businesses to take three years to make a profit. Thomas says she's still not making as much money as she did in TV news, but she expects to reach that mark this year. She works about the same number of hours now as she did as a journalist -- about 40 per week, if not more. ""The big difference is, the hours aren't straight through -- they vary."" That's not to say that Thomas hasn't made mistakes. ""Don't assume that things will come right away,"" she advises. ""Realize that the opportunities that come to you may not be in the form of money -- but they're still valuable."" Also worth keeping in mind: Don't overwork yourself. ""I'm still learning this,"" Thomas said. ""I jumped in with both feet in the fire. Don't burn yourself out."" If she were launching her business all over again, she says, she would build more ""me"" time into her schedule. ""I may take a day at the beginning of the week where I don't take clients and do paperwork -- or I just get a massage."" What's the best thing about being your own boss? Thomas laughs sheepishly. ""I can sleep in if I want to -- and schedule an appointment for lunch instead of early morning.""",0.6616847,9566
38,"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents and producers share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Soledad O'Brien and Stan Wilson visited San Quentin for ""Black in America: The Black Man"" which rebroadcasts tonight at 8 p.m. ET. ""I want to have everything that an average American would want,"" said Chris Shurn who served time in prison. OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Chris Shurn walked out of San Quentin Prison in June after serving four years of hard time for possession of crack cocaine and a weapon charge. He joined at least 3,000 men paroled each year in Oakland, California, where the recidivism rate is more than 50 percent. When our documentary team first met Shurn inside San Quentin in 2008, he considered himself one of the lucky ones. At 21, he entered prison with a fourth-grade education, but left with a GED certificate and was only a few semesters short of earning an associate degree. Shurn told us there were few role models around him as a kid. He said his father left home before he entered the first grade, his mother was a crack addict and he was surrounded by a lot of violence. Ironically, San Quentin is where Shurn met the kind of role models he said he needed to break the cycle of incarceration. His hard work and determination to change caught the eye of Everett Highbaugh, who runs a program called Project Choice. Twice a week, Highbaugh goes into San Quentin with the goal of transforming men like Shurn from drug entrepreneurs to business entrepreneurs. Upon his release, Shurn replaced his dreadlocks and prison uniform with casual attire and a neatly manicured haircut. He said he felt relieved after the harsh conditions of prison life, but said he struggles every day in his Oakland neighborhood to resist the temptations of making easy money by selling crack cocaine. ""I want to have a family. I want to own a house. I want to have everything that an average American would want; a good-paying job, a career,"" he said. But the odds are against him. Nearly 1 million black men are behind bars, an especially crippling blow to black communities, where one in three black men will have a prison record in their lifetimes. They leave behind communities filled with fear, broken families and a generation of vulnerable children. After Shurn left San Quentin, Highbaugh was in contact with him twice a week and helped him land a part-time job at Goodwill Industries. At Goodwill, Shurn spent 30 hours a week in a labor-intensive job, stacking goods and preparing them for shipment. ""I remember reading a lot of these very same books in prison,"" said Shurn as he was busy working. He was grateful to have a job, but frustrated because it paid so little, $7 an hour. That job lasted only a few months. When we caught up with him in January, he had been unemployed for a while. As he sat in Oakland's Oracle Arena watching the inauguration of President Barack Obama, he wondered how he was going to help support his girlfriend and her daughter and earn enough tuition money to continue working toward his degree. Shurn has moved a few times, but is still hoping for success, still fighting against long odds, particularly in a severely debilitated job market. He's hopeful that his hard work and the skills he learned through Project Choice will be a much better alternative than making easy money on the street -- a certain pathway back to prison. ""Every day of my life, with or without work, I feel vulnerable,"" said Shurn. ""Instead of waking up every day and going to a 9-to-5; I used to wake up and go outside and sell some drugs and have my money for a whole week."" ""It crosses my mind, but I got to a point where I'm disciplined and don't need to venture into it."" A few weeks ago, Shurn was hired as a courier for a local printing business. The job pays $9 per hour; $2 more than his previous job. He says the new job won't be enough to pay all the bills, but his goal is to build a résumé so future employers will take a chance on an ex-convict who's trying to recover from a mistake that cost him four years of his life.",0.66130614,1949

Watch Demmellash talk about her childhood » . Nearly a decade later, Demmellash and her mother reunited in Boston, Massachusetts. But Demmellash found her mother wasn't living the American dream she'd envisioned. ""I [thought] I would find my mom in a beautiful mansion with trees [and] gold everywhere,"" recalls Demmellash, now 29. ""I was shocked when I found her in her tiny apartment ... working very, very hard."" Her mother had worked as a waitress during the day and a seamstress at night to earn money to bring her daughter to the United States. Watching her mother sew beautiful gowns for low profits, Demmellash thought there had to be a way for her to increase what she was making as a seamstress. ""Even though she had the skills, she did not necessarily have the business skills,"" she says, adding that her mother's pricing ""was completely off."" Still, her mother worked tirelessly to keep her daughter adequately fed, clothed and in school. Demmellash was later admitted to Harvard University, which she was able to attend with the help of ""wonderful financial aid."" At Harvard, Demmellash and classmate Alex Forrester discussed what their generation could do to alleviate poverty on a local level. They set out to learn what resources people needed -- or as Demmellash says, ""to find people like my mom."" In 2004, the pair started Rising Tide Capital (RTC) to help those who had ideas and abilities but needed the education and support to launch or grow their businesses. ""You hear a lot of talk about Main Street and Wall Street, but no one really talks about how exactly you go about helping the Mom-and-Pops,"" says Demmellash. The group runs the Community Business Academy, an intensive training session coupled with year-round coaching and mentorship to help individuals ""really work on the hands-on management side of their business,"" Demmellash says. The organization supports underserved populations, including women, the formerly incarcerated, minorities, unemployed and working poor, and immigrants and refugees. Demmellash and Forrester -- now married -- have helped 250 entrepreneurs and small-business owners in New Jersey so far, 70 percent of whom are single mothers. RTC raises money from corporations and works with local governments for funding in order to provide classes and support its participants at affordable costs. Participants pay a small materials and registration fee based on their income range: either $100 or $225 for the course that Demmellash says would cost thousands of dollars otherwise. The organization has also built partnerships with micro-lenders, so when students are ready, the lenders provide financing. ""The ability to become self-reliant, to have economic hope, [that is] the fabric of this country and we have to fight for it,"" Demmellash says. Many of RTC's students use the increased earnings from their new business to supplement their wages, allowing them to better provide for their families and transform the face of their communities, according to Demmellash. ""There are thousands of entrepreneurs, millions across this country, who do incredible things and make money to put food on the table, to pay their bills, and to save for the future and their children,"" she says.

Jean Lindsay records a video telling people to get out of their nightgowns and look for work. (CNN) -- Jean Lindsay, a spunky 67-year-old with two masters' degrees, panicked after she failed to land a job in the garden center of a Lowe's home-improvement store. She started to wonder whether a woman of her age ever would be able to find work. She worried about her debt, and weeks of unemployment were turning into months. After the job interview, she stayed up most of the night in the fits of an anxiety attack -- vomiting and huddling under the bedcovers with her two dogs. ""God, I felt like I was falling off the ends of the earth,"" she said. A few days later, though, she tossed on a red sweater, plopped down in front of her computer, flipped on her Web camera -- and, suddenly, while streaming her story onto the Internet, things seemed OK.

""It's a great way of being able to network with people who are either in a similar situation or who may have some resources to help you,"" she said. The number of people who need this help is on the rise. Some older people are delaying retirement because of the economic recession; and, according to an analysis by the AARP Public Policy Institute, those who are looking for work typically search for about a third longer than people younger than 55.

The same goes for her job search. ""This has really invigorated me,"" she said of her forays with a virtual persona. ""It's something where I've had success.

41,"GOLDEN, Colorado (CNN) -- Sometimes the best way to roll with the punches is to roll the dice. Jerry Goldsmith was one of hundreds of people who turned out this week to apply for a casino job. That's Jerry Goldsmith's attitude. The Colorado man lost his engineering job of 29 years -- and the six-figure salary that went with it -- and is now applying for a casino job dealing craps, blackjack, roulette and poker.

The applicants were going after 90 spots in dealer school. Earlier on Wednesday, Goldsmith had interviewed for a job as a cable TV installer. They were his first job interviews since losing his job. He says that, at first, he spent a lot of time on the Internet looking for work. He also contacted executive headhunters but was unable to find any leads in the engineering field. So he decided to expand his search into other areas. Goldsmith says he nailed the casino job interview and thinks he would make a great dealer. ""When you've been working hard all your life, quitting is just not an option, so I'll take on any opportunity I can,"" he says, adding with a laugh: ""Hopefully there will be some exchange of gratuity in the business so I make something."" In a November referendum, Colorado voters approved a measure to expand betting limits at casinos in Colorado from $5 to $100 and to add the games of roulette and craps. The new rules will also allow the casinos to stay open 24 hours a day. They currently close at 2 a.m. and open at 8 a.m. The state hopes to benefit from the increased tax dollars, a portion of which will help fund community colleges, but before the first new tax dollar goes into state coffers, the casinos need to staff up. ""Twenty-four-hour gaming adds a whole extra shift every day, seven days a week. You're adding an extra shift in every department of the casino,"" says Jef Bauer, who runs three casinos in Black Hawk, Colorado, for Golden Gaming: the Golden Mardi Gras, Golden Gates and Golden Gulch. ""We're looking to hire initially about 90 people into our dealer school, which we're offering free to learn how to deal craps, roulette and blackjack."" Golden Gaming currently employs about 400 people in Black Hawk and anticipates adding another 100 by July 2, when the new rules go into effect. Black Hawk is a former mining town tucked into the Rocky Mountains about 35 miles from Denver. Black Hawk and its next-door neighbor, Central City, became casino towns in the 1990s. For years the towns flourished, but Bauer says times are tough now. ""We have just been through 12 months of declines in gaming revenues and head counts,"" he says, adding that he hopes the increased bet limits, new games and extended hours will bring the gamblers back to the tables. Before the hiring event even started, more than 100 people were lined up, waiting for an interview outside of a bar in Golden, Colorado. The would-be croupiers filed in, filled out applications and were assigned a number. They were photographed and then sat down for a 3-minute job interview. No experience was necessary for the casino jobs. Applicants who make the grade will attend a casino-run, part-time dealer school for three months, where they will learn the complicated games and qualify for a Colorado gaming license. The jobs pay between $40,000 and $80,000 a year, depending on tips. So who would make a good dealer? ""Mainly what we're looking at is personality and an ability to entertain, and intelligence that can be proven in dealer school,"" says Bauer. ""Most will probably never have dealt cards before."" That seems like just the ticket to Andrea Pitts, whose only casino experience has been on the other side of the table. ""I'm a high roller,"" she says with a laugh. ""I've never dealt cards before, but I love to play blackjack and I'm pretty good at it."" Pitts, 41, spent 12 years working in the trucking industry. But the bad economy has taken its toll, and now she has been forced to look for any kind of work. Like most of the other casino applicants, she never pictured herself dealing cards. But she says she is ready for the change of pace. ""You have to keep yourself motivated. It would be easy to sit at home and feel sorry for yourself, but that's not going to get you anywhere,"" she says. ""I'm not afraid to take challenges -- that's what life is all about."" Casinos are big business. According to the American Gaming Association, some 360,000 people work in 467 commercial casinos across the country, accounting for $13.8 billion in wages including benefits and tips. The industry paid $5.78 billion in gaming taxes in 2007. Alan Meister, an economist and the author of ""Indian Gaming Industry Report,"" says there were 346,000 people directly employed by 423 Indian gaming casinos in 2007. State governments often look to casinos as a quick source of tax income in difficult economic times. According to Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting firm that monitors the gaming industry, at least 15 states have recently expanded or are currently considering expanding gambling.

He says that when the industry was booming he was making a salary in the ""low six figures,"" drove a new BMW and lived in a house in the tony Cherry Creek section of Denver. But since the market tanked, he has been making adjustments. He sold the BMW and bought a used 2001 Jeep. He sold the house in Cherry Creek and bought a smaller house on the outskirts of Denver. Now all he needs is a job, and he thinks being a casino dealer might be a good fit. ""Real estate was a great job, great income,"" he says. ""But you have to do what you have to do in this economy and make the adjustments to where the job you have pays the bills.""",0.65827864,1952
42,"SANTA BARBARA, California (CNN) -- Barbara Harvey climbs into the back of her small Honda sport utility vehicle and snuggles with her two golden retrievers, her head nestled on a pillow propped against the driver's seat. Californian Barbara Harvey says she is forced to sleep in her car with her dogs after losing her job earlier this year. A former loan processor, the 67-year-old mother of three grown children said she never thought she'd spend her golden years sleeping in her car in a parking lot. ""This is my bed, my dogs,"" she said. ""This is my life in this car right now."" Harvey was forced into homelessness this year after being laid off. She said that three-quarters of her income went to paying rent in Santa Barbara, where the median house in the scenic oceanfront city costs more than $1 million. She lost her condo two months ago and had little savings as backup. ""It went to hell in a handbasket,"" she said. ""I didn't think this would happen to me. It's just something that I don't think that people think is going to happen to them, is what it amounts to. It happens very quickly, too."" Harvey now works part time for $8 an hour, and she draws Social Security to help make ends meet. But she still cannot afford an apartment, and so every night she pulls into a gated parking lot to sleep in her car, along with other women who find themselves in a similar predicament.  Watch women who live in their cars » . There are 12 parking lots across Santa Barbara that have been set up to accommodate the growing middle-class homelessness. These lots are believed to be part of the first program of its kind in the United States, according to organizers. The lots open at 7 p.m. and close at 7 a.m. and are run by New Beginnings Counseling Center, a homeless outreach organization. It is illegal for people in California to sleep in their cars on streets. New Beginnings worked with the city to allow the parking lots as a safe place for the homeless to sleep in their vehicles without being harassed by people on the streets or ticketed by police. Harvey stays at the city's only parking lot for women. ""This is very safe, and that's why I feel very comfortable,"" she said. Nancy Kapp, the New Beginnings parking lot coordinator, said the group began seeing a need for the lots in recent months as California's foreclosure crisis hit the city hard. She said a growing number of senior citizens, women and lower- and middle-class families live on the streets.  See how foreclosure filings are up 75 percent » . ""You look around today, and there are so many,"" said Kapp, who was homeless with her young daughter two decades ago. ""I see women sleeping on benches. It's heartbreaking."" She added, ""The way the economy is going, it's just amazing the people that are becoming homeless. It's hit the middle class."" She and others with New Beginnings walk the streets looking for people and families sleeping in their cars. The workers inform them about the parking lot program. New Beginnings screens people to make sure they won't cause trouble. No alcohol or drugs are allowed in the parking lots. ""What we are trying to do is we pull bad apples out, and we put good apples in the parking lots and really help people out,"" said Shaw Tolley, another coordinator with New Beginnings. Most of the time, the lots are transition points. New Beginnings works with each person to try to find a more permanent housing solution. ""It saddens me when they live in their vehicles,"" Tolley said. ""It is not the most ideal situation for senior citizens and families, but it is reality."" He added, ""We need to engage this problem. This is reality."" John Quigley, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said the California housing crisis has left many middle-class families temporarily homeless or forced them to go to food banks to feed their families. ""Part of the reason why it's so painful in Santa Barbara is, there's so little in the way of alternative housing,"" Quigley said. ""If there were alternative low and moderate housing and rental accommodations that were reasonably close by, you can imagine it wouldn't have this desperate look to it as people living in their cars."" At the only lot for women in Santa Barbara, it's a tough existence. There are no showers or running water. On the night CNN visited, a half-dozen women were in the parking lot before nightfall. Linn Labou, 54, lives in her car with four cats. She used to be in the National Guard and is on a waiting list for government housing, but the wait is a year long. ""I went looking for family, but I couldn't get them to help me,"" she said. As for Harvey, she begins each day by walking her two dogs before going to her part-time job. She leaves the dogs in her car with its windows cracked while she works. It's another chapter in her life that she's certain she'll get through. Her 19-year-old daughter moved in with friends to avoid being homeless. Her other children live overseas, and she didn't want to tell them about her living status. Even if her children offered to help, she said, she wouldn't accept it. ""They know me well enough to know that I will get through this."" ""My daughter especially is very unhappy. Sometimes she'll cry, and she'll call and say, 'Mom, I just can't stand it that you are living in a car,' "" Harvey said. ""I'll say, 'You know what? This is OK for right now, because I'm safe, I'm healthy, the dogs are doing OK, and I have a job, and things will get better.'

43,"(CNN) -- Luis Caplan served the poor of the South Bronx for decades out of a small medical office. His leg was amputated after a bout with cancer in 1990, yet he continued to work for another five years. Luis Caplan, 71, asks of the stimulus package: ""What happens to the real middle class?"" Now, his savings have nearly been wiped out because of the economic crisis. At the age of 71, he faces losing his apartment if things don't change soon. The government bailed out the big institutions, but ""what happens to the little people?"" he asks. ""What happens to the real middle class? What happens to me?"" he says, choking back tears. ""It's awful. It's really awful."" With Congress working to pass the $800 billion stimulus bill, millions of  Americans -- especially those with homes they're trying to sell or about to be foreclosed on -- are asking the same thing: What's in it for me? Caplan says most of his equity is tied up in his 800-square-foot apartment that he purchased in 1985. He wants to sell it to move to Seattle, Washington, to be near his daughter, who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But his place has sat on the market for three months without an offer. Located in a tony neighborhood in Manhattan's Upper East Side, apartments used to sell in a matter of weeks. Caplan has dropped $50,000 from the original asking price of $625,000 and may have to drop the price again. He says he can barely afford maintenance fees and other monthly costs associated with his place. He hopes to make enough money to pay off the reverse mortgage he took out to supplement his Social Security payments. ""I don't know how much more I can go through like this,"" he says, sobbing even more. ""I'm going crazy with this."" His son, Danny Caplan, says, ""He's collateral damage. He has equity and could sell it and walk away and have enough to live comfortably. But [he can't] because of the economic situation."" America's housing crisis has become a key issue for Washington policymakers. Millions of Americans are in foreclosure or facing foreclosure; others are out of work trying to sell their homes in a down economy. And there are elderly people, such as Caplan, who want to sell immediately to help stabilize their finances. Send us your thoughts on the stimulus plan . President Obama on Tuesday told people at a town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Florida, that he plans to announce in coming weeks ""what our overall housing strategy is going to be."" Secretary of Treasury Tim Geithner made the rounds in Washington on Tuesday to push the stimulus bill, including the need to jump-start America's housing market.  See stimulus bill provisions » . ""Homeowners around the country are seeing the value of their homes fall because of forces they did not create and cannot control,"" he said. ""This crisis in housing has had devastating consequences, and our government should have moved more forcefully to help contain the damage."" At one Senate hearing, Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, said ""decisive action"" is needed to address the housing crisis. ""I think the message should come through clear from all of us, you have to move aggressively, clearly, and to start working,"" Reed said. ""I agree with you,"" Geithner responded. ""Our objective is, and our hope is, that our program meets that test."" The stimulus bill does sweeten the pot for potential homebuyers, which supporters say could help spur the economy. Critics charge that letting housing prices stabilize on their own is healthy for the economy. The Senate's version of the bill offers a $15,000 tax credit to anyone who purchases a home in the next year, more than double the tax credit offered by the House. Dwight Jaffee, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of California-Berkeley, says the housing market is the ""perfect instrument in leading the economy out of recession because housing is such a big-ticket item."" ""We will not turnaround this economy until we start to turn around housing. I hope people in Washington are hearing it,"" he says. In the case of Luis Caplan, Jaffee says, ""What it means to him, if they did carry out this program, then the government would be stimulating the demand -- the buyers -- for his apartment to sell it at a fuller price and much sooner."" Caplan says that would be a good thing. He needs all the help he can get. Born in Argentina, Caplan came to the United States as a legal immigrant in 1964 to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor. He eventually became a naturalized U.S. citizen and opened his medical office to help treat the Spanish-speaking poor of the South Bronx. He believed his calling was to help ""the poorest of the poor"" get decent medical treatment, rather than pursue the more high-paying lifestyle of other doctors. Most of his patients were on Medicaid, so he got paid at a rate much less than other doctors. He beams with pride at the lives he saved. ""I caught cancers very early,"" he said. ""I'm not the savior of humanity. ... I just did what I could to help poor people."" In June 1990 at the age of 53, Caplan started having pain in his left leg. It turned out to be a malignant tumor and his leg was amputated. Yet his passion and commitment to helping others kept him going. Even after losing his leg, he went back to work for another five years. When he retired, he got another shocker: Social Security initially rejected him -- a man without a leg -- for disability. He says he scraped and saved money along the way, ""a very small amount that has practically disappeared."" He now scoots around his apartment in his wheelchair hoping for better days. As far as he's concerned, the big Wall Street institutions can ""burn in hell."" ""I don't have a Rolls-Royce. I don't have a Cadillac,"" he says. ""The government ... isn't trying to help everybody: People like me that went through this, people who did something good for the community, people who didn't buy an expensive painting for their office."" Caplan pauses. ""This is what I'm left with: an apartment that can hardly sell."" His son is proud of his father's accomplishments, yet he's frustrated that his dad is in such a financial pinch during a time that's supposed to be the Golden Years of his life. ""He bought the American dream and paid for the American dream,"" says Danny Caplan. CNN's Jackie Adams contributed to this report.",0.65459955,8793
44,"(CNN) -- Segway scooter inventor Dean Kamen freely admits it: He often suffers sleepless nights wrestling over whether to quit a project that's not panning out. Knowing when to quit a fruitless project is difficult, says the father of the Segway, Dean Kamen, left. ""You end up lying there saying, 'I'm not stopping. It would be an act of shallow cowardice. Or you decide to quit and you say, 'This is one of those ideas that just isn't going to work,' "" said Kamen, speaking by phone from his home office in Manchester, New Hampshire. When to quit -- said Kamen, also the inventor of health care technologies and the Slingshot water purifier -- is ""the toughest question there is"" for any entrepreneur who survives on creativity and instinct. ""It's not nearly as glamorous as people think to keep working on something and to keep hitting roadblocks and to keep going,"" he said. Stubborn, delusionally optimistic, creative, fearless, flexible and focused are some of the ways psychologists and business people describe the personality of an entrepreneur. Surprisingly, another word is ignorant.  Quiz: Do you have the right stuff for entrepreneurship? » . ""You need to be in denial or in ignorance about the huge challenges you face,"" laughs Guy Kawasaki, a former Apple executive and entrepreneur who's starting the self-described ""magazine rack"" alltop.com. ""You have to believe that it wouldn't be hard for you to succeed."" Research by Harvard Business School psychology professor emeritus Abraham Zaleznik has unveiled a darker side to the entrepreneur's psyche. ""Entrepreneurs tend to have a singular weakness that allows them to do things without checking their conscience,"" Zaleznik said. ""Juvenile delinquents act and then try to sort things out afterward. I think entrepreneurs have this tendency."" Another academic researcher on the topic, professor Kelly Shaver of the College of William & Mary, told Forbes magazine in 2002 that successful entrepreneurs ""really don't care as much"" about what other people think. ""They're just happy to go ahead and do what they're doing."" In a recession that has forced employers to eliminate 2.6 million jobs in 2008, people who might otherwise start a business at a time of their own choosing find themselves being pushed into entrepreneurship. ""More people often become self-employed in tough times like this,"" said John Challenger, CEO of a top employment firm for executives and middle managers. Between 5 percent and 7 percent of clients at Challenger, Gray & Christmas are choosing to start their own businesses, he said. Workers are more open to starting a small business in the dot-com era, Challenger said. ""I think we're in a more entrepreneurial period than we were in the '80s and '90s,"" he said. Recessions can be ""crucibles"" for at-home start-ups. ""Some of the best new businesses start in recessions because what they have really makes a difference if the market is interested in it,"" Challenger said. ""There's not a lot of easy money to go around, and they have to fight their way forward."" Great entrepreneurs, said Kawasaki, do more than just fight hard to win their market share. They have vision. They ask what he calls the ""fundamental question"": Wouldn't it be neat if ... ? Kawasaki said Apple would have failed without the unique contributions of its co-founder, Steve Jobs. ""He asked the question, 'Wouldn't it be neat if people could carry all their music with them wherever they went?' "" Result: the iPod. Psychologist Lynn Friedman, whose clients often include entrepreneurs, said many of them are ""tuned into consumer needs."" They tend to grow up in nurturing families and learned to value the concept of trying new things. Jobs described fond memories of his California childhood during an 1995 interview with the Smithsonian Institution, saying his father ""spent a lot of time with me . . . teaching me how to build things, how to take things apart, put things back together."" But obviously, Kawasaki said, everybody's not always right about the ""wouldn't it be neat"" question. He cited Webvan, the online grocery store that served as many as 10 U.S. cities before going bankrupt in 2001. ""Somebody asked the question, 'Wouldn't it be neat if I could buy lettuce online and they'll deliver lettuce to my house?' "" Webvan failed with sales of $178.5 million in 2000 partly because it was buried in $525.4 million in expenses, according to a 2001 CNNMoney.com article. ""They went about it in a grand way,"" Kawasaki said. ""Sometimes it helps to start small."" Webvan entrepreneur Louis Borders, who stepped down as CEO in 1999, told the San Francisco Chronicle four years later, ""I get the strategy set, the operation running, the team in place. That's my role as an entrepreneur."" According to Friedman, entrepreneurs ""live in the world of action,"" and they ""often need help with slowing down and thinking several steps ahead."" Kamen, who works hard to inspire future innovators with his FIRST program to promote high school math and science, said every entrepreneurial innovator he's ever seen shares a few characteristics. ""It's not that they're brilliant or well-educated,"" Kamen said. ""They work all the time. They don't let failure demoralize or destroy them. They pick themselves up and keep going and eventually, every once in a while, one of your ideas actually breaks through and works, and it makes all that stuff seem worthwhile.""",0.654515,9552

46,"(CNN) -- Erika Preuss gave a worried glance over rows and rows of empty cars packing the Wal-Mart parking lot at 3:30 a.m. Sean Blake said he met Black Friday campers in Houston, Texas, who call themselves the ""Best Buy family."" She was 30 minutes early at the sprawling store in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, where she had arrived to take advantage of Friday's 4 a.m. post-Thanksgiving clothing deals. But there were no tents, no campers, no eager shoppers waiting to spend their dollars. Preuss said she expected to wait in a line to get service, but people were already inside, and the store was filled with frenzied shoppers. She captured video to document her experience. ""So apparently Wal-Mart did take pity on the poor souls standing outside in the cold and let people into the store early,"" Preuss said. ""Here's how they handle it: They shrink-wrap all the goodies in plastic wrap, so all the good sale items are wrapped in black Saran wrap, and no one can touch them until 4 a.m."" As a self-described ""Black Friday virgin,"" Preuss says, she has lots to learn about the proper technique for this holiday weekend ritual. ""I discovered that I was very unprepared for Black Friday, not dressed properly, as you need more padding to avoid all the shopping carts ramming into you,"" she said. ""I feel like that song, 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,' only the reindeer had a Wal-Mart sign on it."" She decided to see what the hype was about while visiting from Lake Delton, Wisconsin. ""I have three kids, and money is tight,"" she said. ""I'm a single mom. This year, I decided I was going to give it a try and see if I could get some bargains."" Preuss said the lines of people searching for discounted merchandise said a lot about the shape of the economy. Many people were fighting over kids' clothes and other essentials, but she saw much less effort being expended on video games and TV sets. She said she came for the $4 kids' track suits and $8 winter coats. iReport.com: See footage of the shoppers packing the store . Inside the packed store, she began to realize she needed a new strategy to beat the crowds. She decided to grab a bunch of clothing from which to pick. ""I ditched the cart and went in with my bare hands,"" she said. iReport.com: Huge crowd in Puerto Rico . Although Preuss got lucky and immediately entered the toasty store, others across the country were willing to wait in the freezing cold just to get merchandise. Barbara Rademacher woke at 2 a.m. to see the shopping scene and found shoppers huddling outside a Best Buy in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Some had sleeping bags, blankets and winter wear. Chilly hands held lists of the items they planned to buy. ""Laptops! We have lists!"" exclaimed excited shoppers waiting to get into the store. iReport.com: Watch Arkansas customers wait in the cold . Rademacher watched a lengthy stream of people cram through the doors when the store opened. ""It's something fun to experience, because you can only do it once a year,"" one of the aspiring customers said to the camera. Rademacher headed for the nearby Kohl's and found a similar scene as massive queues of people started running into the store. iReport.com: Virginia shoppers join Santa at mall .

47,"TAMPA BAY, Florida (CNN) -- Judging by her proud expression as she left the parking lot in her 1991 Honda Accord for the first time, Jessica Ostrofsky could have been driving a brand new sports car. Susan Jacobs' Wheels of Success program helps low-income workers get their own cars. ""I'm so happy,"" she said with a laugh. ""Having this [car] is going to change my life drastically because it's going to make me totally independent."" Ostrofsky, 31, a single mother of three, had been leaving her house before dawn -- toting a stroller, car seat, diaper bag and purse -- to catch a bus. She would go first to her children's baby sitter and then to work. The trip took up to three hours. But on Labor Day, the St. Petersburg, Florida, resident and 19 others received their own cars, thanks to Susan Jacobs' Wheels of Success program. Since 2003, Wheels of Success has refurbished 280 donated cars for low-income individuals and families and helped another 280 clients with vehicle-related services. ""Receiving ... the car is more than just the car,"" said Jacobs. ""People literally see how it's going to change their life"" by knocking down an obstacle that had gotten in their way due to lack of transportation. Jacobs would know. The 59-year-old Tampa resident lost access to reliable transportation more than a decade ago when she ended a relationship and left her car behind. While staying with a friend who lived far from a bus line and across town from Jacobs' evening job, she had to hitch rides to work. That did not last long, Jacobs said, thanks to a used car dealership owner who loaned Jacobs three clunkers while she saved the money to buy her own car. But soon she saw others in a similar predicament. In 2000, as the manager of a staffing agency, Jacobs was struck by the high number of clients who lost jobs in which her office had placed them because they couldn't always get there. Others turned down positions and promotions because limited public transportation kept them from early or late shifts. Jacobs was laid off from her job at the staffing firm in 2001 and turned it into an opportunity to figure out how to ""keep working families working."" She founded Wheels of Success in 2003 with two donated cars. The organization gives low-cost, donated and refurbished vehicles to qualified full-time workers or those with job offers. Employers or social service agencies refer the applicants to the group. Once they receive their vehicles, they must make low monthly payments based on their personal budgets. Those contributions average $40 and go toward repairing cars for other recipients. ""These are used cars. They're not going to last forever,"" said Jacobs. ""What I tell people is, 'This probably isn't your dream car, but hopefully it's going to get you to your dream.' "" Jacobs' group is able to restore donated clunkers to roadworthy operation by partnering with local companies and corporations that help provide auto body work at significantly discounted rates. Wheels of Success cars come with a free, one-year membership to the American Automobile Association. The organization also helps clients with ongoing repair, licensing, insurance and replacement of a car when it dies.  Watch how Jacobs and her group provide working wheels for families » . Clients are required to complete a car maintenance class and donate three volunteer hours to Wheels of Success per month. This helps the group serve more clients and gives each recipient the ability to ""pay it forward,"" said Jacobs. On any given day, Jacobs reports about 100 qualified recipients on the waiting list for vehicles. About 60 new requests come in every other month. ""We would like nothing better than for there not to be a need for us,"" she said. ""But that isn't realistic in the near future and might not be realistic even long-term for people who have three children and day care."" And recipients agree. ""Susan Jacobs is actually saving my life [because] she's saving my job,"" said Ostrofsky, who had been consistently late arriving to work because of the inconsistency of her bus's arrival. ""In turn, she saves my apartment and saves me taking care of my children.""  Watch Ostrofsky receive her Wheels of Success car » . For Jacobs, seeing the results of her work inspires her.

48,"Editor's note: Peter Bregman is chief executive of Bregman Partners Inc., a global management consulting firm, and the author of ""Point B: A Short Guide to Leading a Big Change"". He writes a weekly column, How We Work, for HarvardBusiness.org. Peter Bregman says good times persuaded people to sacrifice what they loved for money. NEW YORK (CNN) -- I started my consulting business 11 years ago with a laptop computer in a living room. It grew quickly. The first year I made more money than I had in the previous three combined, the second year I doubled that and by the third year I began to fantasize about retiring within the decade. Then everything crashed; the dotcom revolution, the financial services industry and my business. I had a large number of subcontractors and a small number of employees who had become friends. I also had a bad feeling things wouldn't turn around quickly. My wife and I were in a tough spot. We had one child and another on the way, bills that were accumulating and hopes for the future that were moving out of reach. However bad it was then, these days it's worse. Back then the recession hit certain sectors and left other ones alone. Home prices were going up, so people felt protected, and there were loans to help. Today, everything's been hit, nothing's going up and credit is frozen. Many have already lost jobs, homes, self-identities, luxuries and necessities. And there's more to come. That's especially true for many older Americans, who might not have 10 years to recover and who don't have sources of income other than their savings -- which have dwindled dramatically. They don't deserve to live with the fear they now feel. I'm still living in a rental apartment because I didn't want to take out a loan I couldn't pay back. I saved money. Invested it. And now my investments are down 70 percent. But it is what it is. And when we wake up in the morning we are left with the question, ""Now what?"" It's actually a great question, because in a situation in which we've lost control, it gives us a little back. ""Now what?"" means we have a choice, in this moment, to do something. What's it going to be? I think it's a mistake to try to rebuild what we've lost. We have less now and I think we can do better with less. Having less forces choices. And consciously making those choices can bring us closer to the things we care about. Which can make a poorer life richer than a rich one. Because the research is clear. Above a basic threshold, more money doesn't make us happier. But we think it will, so we do all sorts of things that make us unhappy in order to get it. A senior leader in an investment bank called to tell me she was leaving her job. She realized she wouldn't make much money in the next few years and didn't want to miss her children growing up. Did you get that? She was willing to miss her children growing up if the money was good enough. People act in ways they'd rather not in order to make money that doesn't make them happy. Maybe, if we do this downturn right, we can get out of that cycle. So, what makes you happy? Is it spending time with people you love? Working on a pet project? Having the time to exercise? Being part of a community and feeling cared for? Knowing the answer enables you to make decisions that will prioritize those things. Of course, losing money can break people apart; we fight about money, people lose jobs and get depressed; tension rises as mortgage bills sit on the kitchen table unpaid; resentment builds when one person doesn't live up to his own and others' expectations. But I am also seeing the opposite. Losing money can bring you closer to your values; can actually bring people together. It's hard to appreciate in the midst of our loss, but embracing the forced reduction in lifestyle can be positive. I know of a couple whose marriage was saved when they moved from a bigger house into a smaller one and actually began talking to each other again. Last weekend, two people had a beautiful wedding in Central Park surrounded by family and friends, months before they had planned, avoiding thousands of dollars of expenses and all the tension that goes with it. Why? Because she lost her job and needed to get onto his health insurance. Friends of mine held their daughter's bat mitzvah at another friend's house, avoiding tremendous expense while creating the warmest community celebration, filled with gratitude and tears, that I have ever seen. In 2003, after my business crashed, my wife and I decided to move to Savannah, Georgia, where she grew up and life was much cheaper. Had my business continued to grow we could never have afforded to make that choice. When the business crashed, we couldn't afford not to. While there, we spent priceless time with her family, had another child, made lifelong friends and rebuilt my business -- this time very differently. I love consulting and writing and speaking, but the bigger the business became, the less I did those things and the more I managed others doing it. Eventually we returned to New York. Now I'm back to a laptop in a living room and I love it again. It's smaller, more sustainable and a lot more fun. And I have the time to spend with my family and friends. My fantasy is no longer to retire; it's to keep doing what I'm doing for as long as I can. Life is not a linear path of increasing wealth, accumulation and achievement. Don't let the money crisis draw you apart from people you love and things you love to do. Use it to draw you closer.

50,"(CNN) -- The homeless Florida woman who made a tearful plea for help from President Obama earlier this year is still jobless and struggling financially. President Obama greets Henrietta Hughes during a town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Florida, on February 10. Henrietta Hughes caught the nation's attention in February when she cried for help during one of Obama's town hall meetings. After her plea, Hughes was given a free home to live in temporarily, but she is still struggling to find a job and might soon lose that home, CNN affiliate WINK reported Thursday. Hughes, who is in her 60s, faithfully goes to an employment center in Fort Myers in hopes of finding a job. ""It's almost our second home,"" Hughes told WINK. She and her son have taken a computer class at the center to help land work. Hughes said she has applied for as many jobs as possible but has struck out. Her son has had no luck either. Now Hughes says she feels time is running out. The home she lives in was donated by the wife of a Florida lawmaker, Chene Thompson, who has been trying to sell the vacant home in the Fort Myers suburb of Lavelle since 2006. Once the house sells, Hughes will have to leave. But Thompson told CNN that she will do everything in her power to make sure Hughes is not back out on the streets even if her house sells. ""I've told Miss Hughes ... she will never again be homeless, even if I have to personally assist her with her rent,"" said Thompson, who is a longtime advocate of the homeless. Thompson said Hughes reminds her of her grandmother and that she and her son are ""upstanding, good-hearted people."" ""Her concern is that she doesn't want to be a freeloader,"" Thompson said, but Hughes and her son have helped deter vandals who have targeted vacant homes in the area. ""They really are a blessing for me,"" Thompson said. But Hughes told WINK that she worries that she could end up living in her truck again if she has to move without a job. Her plea to Obama came as he promoted his economic stimulus plan at a town hall meeting in southwest Florida. After talking about the plan, the president opened the floor to questions from the crowd. ""I have an urgent need -- unemployment and homelessness, a very small vehicle for my family and I to live in,"" Hughes said at the time. ""The housing authority has two years' waiting lists, and we need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to. We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom. Please help."" Hughes said her son had lost his job, leaving them homeless. Obama gave Hughes a kiss on the cheek and a promise: ""We're going to do everything we can to help you, but there are a lot of people like you.""",0.6374367,3212

Need to catch a bus? Don't try on evenings or weekends. The city has cut that service, too. And when the sun goes down, Colorado Springs is going to look a little bit dimmer. Crews are removing a third of the city's streetlight to save money on electricity and light bulbs. Watch city's PSA on streetlight deactivation . It's this conservative city's way of closing a $28.5 million budget gap. ""You can cry about the fiscal situation ... or you can take it as an opportunity to change, reinvent yourself and innovate and that's what were going to do in Colorado Springs,"" City Councilman Sean Paige said. Other governments are considering higher taxes to avoid such cutbacks, but in the state of Colorado, there is a taxpayers' bill of rights. It prevents state and city governments from raising taxes unless such a measure is approved by the voters. ""We put it on the ballot last fall, and they said 'no,' "" said Paige, a Republican. ""They declined to write the city a blank check, and they said, 'City, tighten your belts. We're tightening ours. You need to do the same.' ""We're going to respect that,"" he added. ""I'm not going to cry about that."" It's not a new concept in Colorado Springs, touted on some Web sites as a ""libertarian paradise."" The city's garbage collection, zoo and philharmonic are all privately funded. The city is even auctioning off its police helicopters on the Internet. Want to place a bid? The latest budget cuts could be felt at community centers like Meadows Park, which is bustling with after-school programs for kids, as well as exercise classes and hot meals for seniors. Unless the center can find private funding, Colorado Springs is slated to shut it down at the end of March. ""I'm hoping that some sort of a miracle will happen so we can keep the centers open,"" said Sheryle Nix, 56. Every day, Nix eats a $2 lunch at the center because she can't afford to eat in a restaurant and has trouble preparing her own food. ""I have a traumatic brain injury, so this really helps keep me on schedule to eat lunch,"" she explained. Jeanie Schweitzer, 55, returned to Colorado Springs to take care of her grandmother Elsie, who suffered a stroke. She brings Elsie to the center to get her out of the house. ""I don't think they should be shutting it down. There should be enough money,"" Schweizer said. ""It's not that much in the big picture to keep it open."" The center is a lifeline for parents who work and cannot pick their kids up after school ends in the afternoon. Lindon Jackson, who is 13, has been coming to the Meadows Park after-school program since she was 3. When asked what she'll do if the center shuts down, she said, ""Nothing."" ""I'd just be home doing nothing."" Whether the government should continue funding Meadows Park and other community centers like it strikes at the heart of the political argument over the role of government, particularly during an economic downturn. ""The model of governments, from the federal government down to municipal governments, don't work anymore,"" according to Chuck Fowler, chairman of City Committee, an alliance of local businesspeople set up by Paige. ""They don't take in as much money. They can't possibly provide the same amount of services, pay their employees, pay their pensions. Something's got to give."" Fowler believes that the solution may be in weaning people off of government services. ""The larger the government is, the more conditioning with certain people that they don't need to take personal responsibility of their life,"" he said. The budget cuts, according to Fowler, ""could really recondition people's ideas about what government should be doing."" ""Should it be doing all of these things, or should it really be focused on the vital things that clearly have a public interest?"" But Brian Kates, who runs Meadows Park Community Center, says the people affected by the government cutbacks ""are pawns in the game."" ""These aren't people trying to be lazy and live off the system,"" Kates said. ""These are hard-working, intelligent and bright [people], and they're not asking for much. We're giving them just the very basics.""",0.63691413,8840
52,"(CNN) -- It was the best of times in 2004, when attorney Dave Dineen graduated from Boston University School of Law and landed a job at a top Massachusetts corporate firm, Foley Hoag LLP. Attorney Dave Dineen at his new job at Greater Boston Legal Services. By 2007, the National Association for Law Placement was reporting the most promising year in two decades. Nearly 92 percent of graduating attorneys were employed, and the median starting salary at private practices had increased by $13,000 --to a total of $108,500 a year. But times have changed. In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the legal industry is taking an unprecedented beating from the sputtering economy and housing meltdown. Dineen, 37, lost his job as layoffs and salary freezes have spiked at law firms across the country during the past three months.  See the law firm layoffs for the past year » . Rather than just hand out a severance package with the pink slip, Foley Hoag gave Dineen an option. He could work for Greater Boston Legal Services, a legal aid group serving people living in poverty. The firm agreed to pay Dineen about a quarter of his former salary for a year. Dineen, who needed to support his wife and a newborn daughter, accepted. ""This gave me a chance to do something different with my legal career, and help out people who generally don't  have access to public service,"" said Dineen, who now works on foreclosure cases helping victims of predatory lending. Foley Hoag is among many megafirms across the country using the economic slump as an ideal time to lend a hand to cash-strapped public interest and legal aid firms. The massive corporate layoffs and program cuts could redirect thousands of young graduates and experienced attorneys from corporate firms into the public sector, legal experts say. Once insulated, law firms are shedding young and mid-career associates at extraordinary rates. This is especially true at large corporate firms that overestimated their growth and extended too many offers to associates last fall. White & Case LLP, a leading global firm with headquartes in New York, made a second round of cuts last week. In addition to about 70 associates laid off in November, the firm last week let go of another 400 people, including 200 attorneys. Other well-known firms such as Heller Ehrman LLP and Thelen Reid & Priest LLP on the West Coast have gone bankrupt in recent months. At least 2,149 attorneys have been laid off in 2009, bringing the total to 3,045 since January of last year, according to Lawshucks.com, an industry Web site tracking the slump. Hundreds more associates set to start jobs this fall are bracing themselves for rescinded offers and deferred start dates. Some students are finding their summers wide open as law firms like Luce Forward, based in California, have canceled internship programs. Amid all this dark news, there might be a silver lining. It could transform the legal profession. ""There is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity coming out of a difficult situation,"" said Esther Lardent, president of the Pro Bono Institute in Washington, who began discussions this month with at least 15 corporate firms nationwide about placing unemployed attorneys in public interest firms. The project will get under way in a few months, she said. Other firms have already encouraged attorneys to go into the public sector. Just last week,  one of the largest firms in the country -- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- announced it will pay deferred associates graduating in 2009 a $5,000 monthly stipend for one year if they secure a job in the public interest field. International law giants Latham & Watkins LLP and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP offered incoming associates who defer employement until October 2010 a $75,000 compensation package. While working in public service isn't mandatory for Latham & Watkins associates, the firm said there was a ""sincere hope"" the deferred associates would ""use the intervening period to pursue a community service or other public advocacy projects of their choosing."" Such deferral plans can save the companies about $100,000 per associate, and law experts expect the list of firms enacting deferral programs to grow geometrically as the economy worsens. ""Firms are doing this to be flexible and regulate their labor force because there just isn't as much work anymore,"" said James G. Leipold, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement. Corporate giants are also scrambling to find work for mid-level attorneys in the public sector. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, a major New York-based law firm, introduced a yearlong public service fellowship program this year that would pay current attorneys $60,000 a year to work in areas such as social service, community development or academia. The company hopes the program will alleviate ""significant budgetary constraints."" ""You aren't just throwing somebody out there,"" said American Bar Association President Tommy Wells, who requested funding in President Obama's stimulus package to help pay attorneys to work in the public sector. (The proposal was rejected.) ""You're meeting a real need in these tough times where you have more of a legal need and fewer resources,"" Wells said. Encouraging laid-off and deferred attorneys to go into public service is filling a desperate need at public interest firms. Public interest and legal aid firms serving the underprivileged have long been under-funded and overwhelmed with cases even in a good economy. Tightened state budgets and a decline in donations have further stretched resources for the public interest firms, forcing them to make staff cuts at a time when demand for their services is greater than ever before. At Greater Boston Legal Services, the public interest firm where Dineen arrived in January, the effects of a sick economy are apparent. Robert Sable, the public interest firm's executive director, has already reduced staff. The agency, which handles 15,000 matters a year, expects to make more staff reductions in the coming months because of a $2 million funding shortfall. ""We're burning through our reserves right now, so it's nice to have extra help,"" said Sable, who is talking to another local corporate firm this week about taking in subsidized attorneys. Some attorneys and law students worry that paying corporate attorneys to work in public interest firms may displace those who actually wanted to work in the public sector in the first place. Jocelyn E. Getgen, who works with students at Cornell Law School, said strained legal aid organizations and nonprofits will want to take in the ""free"" labor. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the economic free-fall is changing the ways current attorneys -- and a new generation of young attorneys -- view the field. Traditionally, law students have equated best jobs with highest-paying jobs, career counselors say. Students saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt find themselves pressured to work at large firms that will pay enough to cover the bills, said Tricia McGrath, a director at Lateral Link Group LLC, a job placement agency for lawyers. Many times, going into the public sector isn't even an option, she said. ""Everyone has to rethink all the old models that we believed in, the model where you go to school and then a big firm,"" said McGrath, who graduated from Fordham University School of Law in 1998, a time when law jobs were abundant. iReport.com: Cutting back with brown-bag lunches? Show us on video . Even students at top law schools are finding that their offers have been rescinded. At Harvard Law School, Mark Weber, assistant dean for career services, said he has been working with a handful of students whose job offers have been deferred. ""It can be a tremendous opportunity for the student to take that year and try something entirely different,"" Weber said. ""Hopefully within a year, the economic picture will do better."" After not receiving a corporate firm job offer in the downtrodden industry, Scott Greenwood, set to graduate this spring from the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law, will instead work for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""I can see what it's like to work for a regulatory agency, and that's a different expertise that attorneys don't always get to have,"" said Greenwood, who will begin working in Washington in August. ""I've been thinking about it as a blessing in disguise.""",0.63625985,3319

Angela Logan samples a bite of her Mortgage Apple Cake as Bake Me A Wish! founder Josh Kaye looks on. But when she fell into foreclosure on her Teaneck, New Jersey, home, Logan turned to baking an apple cake her family had always loved. ""It was a flash of desperation,"" Logan said. ""I thought, 'Wow. We could sell these cakes, they're so good.' "" Logan named her delicacy Mortgage Apple Cake and resolved to sell 100 in 10 days at $40 each to meet a mortgage payment, pay off bills and qualify for a federal program that could lower her monthly payments. She advertised the cake to everyone she knew, including her classmates. ""The hardest part was saying, 'Can you buy my cakes, this is my problem,' because admitting to your friends that you're in foreclosure, and that you need their help, that's a hard thing to say,"" Logan said. Two years ago, a contractor promised to renovate Logan's brick-and-stucco home. But instead, Logan says he took the money and did only a portion of the work -- leaving the entire second floor bare to the beams and plastic wrap still covering much of the exterior. Logan's financial squeeze tightened when one of the actress' talent agencies shut down without paying her for commercial work. The 55-year-old divorced mother of three fell far behind on her mortgage and other debt payments, leading her to seek help from Consumer Credit Counseling of New Jersey. Counselor Pamela Glass brainstormed with Logan to envision potential extra sources of income. ""We put our heads together to make extra money,"" Glass said. ""I said, 'Take a look at what you can do.' She said, 'I bake once in a while'. I said, 'Well, maybe you can do some baking.' "" When Logan asked, neighbors, fellow church congregants and classmates responded. Soon she was baking night and day, two cakes at a time. Al Hamdi, general manager of the Hilton in nearby Hasbrouck Heights, heard of Logan's plan and offered the hotel's four giant ovens, letting her accelerate production. ""She was going to do something out of the box to save her home and her family. That was the inspiring part for us,"" Hamdi said. Logan figures she's baked about 200 cakes -- double her goal. And since qualifying for the federal Make Home Affordable program, her monthly mortgage payment is dropping by nearly 20 percent .

Internet retailer Bake Me A Wish! got a whiff of the Mortgage Apple Cake and is preparing to mass-produce it and share the proceeds with Logan.

55,"PALMETTO, Georgia (CNN) -- The idea of investing in new home construction and high-end restaurant businesses would send most entrepreneurs running these days, but developers in a small community in rural Georgia say they're still growing. The community of Serenbe in rural Georgia is surrounded by 40,000 acres of dense forest. At first glance Serenbe is a bucolic scene of horses and stables ringed by 40,000 acres of dense oak and pine forest, but as you drive around the first bend, a collection of look-alike white houses emerges, giving the distinct impression of a conventional high-end housing development. But a 21st century high-tech eco-village soon emerges from the mists. There are paths leading to water recycling facilities, composting, recycling, and 25 acres of organic-certified farmland, four of which are planted with anything from hops for beer making to sweet peas. A silver sign is prominently displayed in recognition of Serenbe's ecologically sound construction, proving that Serenbe is not the average cookie-cutter housing development. Serenbe, a community founded on principles of farm-to-table cooking and environmentally conscious building techniques, has seen its fortunes rise while the rest of the country struggles. The development's founders have sold four homes and five building lots at the development since January alone, and they believe that innovation may be just the thing the economy needs. Founders Marie and Steve Nygren say they're running their business the old-fashioned way: looking back to what they call a ""village model,"" where people shop and dine locally, helping to sustain each other's business while also creating less waste. ""People are looking for what's important, quality of life, for them and their children. Many of the residents want to know their neighbors, and we're creating public spaces where they can interact,"" Steve says. The community started small: the Nygrens bought a farmhouse and 90 acres of land back in 1991. At first they used it as a weekend retreat from nearby Atlanta, but three years later they made it their permanent residence and workplace. Soon the 90 acres became 1000, the farmhouse became an inn, and the Nygrens developed a vision of community. ""We're intentional in the way that we respect the environment. It's about the way you live, the way you interact, the way you eat,"" says Marie. It has also been a business success: today Serenbe is a four-year-old upscale housing development, where the starting price for a house is $350,000. In the last three years Serenbe has grown to a community of 160 residents, mostly young families who work in the Atlanta area, the self-employed or retired. So far, 102 freshly built environmentally friendly homes and business spaces have been rented and sold, a small collection of boutiques and galleries has popped up, and at the heart of the community, three restaurants are thriving.  See photos of what the community looks like » . Hilary White is the latest chef to join Serenbe's community, and her 18-month-old restaurant, The Hil on the Hill, is now the centerpiece of the community's small commercial block. White came to Serenbe for the four-acre organic farm that is now steps away from her kitchen. She gets her kale there in the winter, her fruit in summer, and for most of the year enough produce for all of her cooking at the restaurant. Not only does she save fuel and energy by minimizing the products she has to have shipped in, but diners near and far are drawn to the freshness of farm-to-table cuisine. ""The winter is a smaller menu, but in the summer it's endless,"" she says. Harvesting the last delicate bundles of this season's spinach for tonight's dinner, she already knows how to use them: ""We like these leaves, nice and crinkly, holds the vinaigrette really well, and it's just got a real good flavor."" In colder months she makes her culinary creations with hearty winter vegetables like shitake mushrooms, cabbage and Kohlrabi, a water chestnut-textured turnip. But what's driving the restaurant's success in these cold economic climes? Jim White, Hilary's husband and business partner, says it's the alternative nature of their business that has saved them from going under. ""We don't have as much of a roller coaster ride, people are traveling to see us, and they come from the city because of the whole farm-to-table concept.""  Watch a farm-to-table cooking demo » . Hilary and Jim admit that the restaurant's sales have slowed recently, but business is brisk enough that they have no plans to scale back. And Serenbe is also bucking some of the national trends, especially when it comes to real estate. According to the National Association of Realtors, new home sales in 2008 were down nearly 37 percent, and it is projected that in 2009 sales could fall another 39 percent. The figures have scared developers away from investing in new types of property, but Steve Nygren says that Serenbe is maintaining sales even now. ""We still have consistent movement,"" Steve says, ""and considering the current environment we're really pleased."" Shelton Stanfill was one of Serenbe's first full-time residents. Before moving to the development in 2006 he ran Atlanta's Woodruff Arts Center. He says he was attracted to Serenbe because he saw it as a ""poster child for the anti-sprawl mentality."" Like many other residents, Stanfill was also drawn to the communal feel of the development. ""We lived in Atlanta for 11 years and within four months of being at Serenbe I knew more people by first name than I ever did in my old neighborhood,"" he says. When Steve Nygren started building his vision of an eco-community, conventional developers were skeptical about Serenbe, but now Steve says that ""a lot of those developers are coming out now with tape measures and cameras to see what we're doing. They're realizing that high-quality environmental developments sell.""",0.6350904,4317
56,"CLAXTON, Georgia (CNN) -- Chrysler LLC's decision last week to close nearly 800 dealerships may just be business, but for the people who work and trade in those showrooms and service bays, it's personal. Claxton Chrysler Dodge Jeep is at the literal and figurative heart of Claxton, Georgia. ""They're not terminating a building or a franchise, they're terminating people that need jobs. And it's not right. It's just not right,"" said Daniel Womack, owner of Claxton Chrysler Dodge Jeep in tiny Claxton, Georgia. Womack received a hand-delivered letter from Chrysler on Thursday. ""When I got to 'We regret ...' I stopped,"" Womack said. The bankrupt automaker was terminating its agreement with Claxton, the only Chrysler dealer within 25 miles, and a profitable one at that. ""It was like standing out in the road and having a bus run over the top of us,"" he said. The agreement ends June 9, but the effect is already being felt. All of the dealer's major lending banks called and said they would no longer work with Claxton, general manager Doug Shontz said.  Watch the owner's heart break for his employees » . ""Since the thing happened, we haven't had a soul in here for service,"" he said. ""We haven't turned one wrench. We have nothing for next week. When they brought that list out, that was the kiss of death."" The dealership, its employees and their customers are intertwined like dashboard wires. ""There's only 11 of us here, but we're family,"" said Shontz, who just started there in December. ""We all know each other, we see each other every day. I spend more time with this group here than I do with my own family."" Townsfolk tend to wander in off the street, just to shoot the breeze over a cup of coffee. Take Gary Sapp, for example. The military veteran, wounded in Vietnam, stopped in Saturday, as he does just about every day, to say hello and maybe talk about cars a little bit. He said he might come back Monday and make a deal, just as he's done there three times in the past 10 years. But it's not really about the cars and pickup trucks. ""These are good folks here,"" Sapp said. Claxton, a town of about 2,300 hard by the Canoochee River about 50 miles west of Savannah in southern Georgia, is famous for its namesake fruitcakes, which are sold with pride at Mrs. Rogers' Restaurant and seemingly half the other businesses in town. On East Main Street, a whitewashed brick building still bears an S&H Green Stamps sign and Stella's Phase III serves up $6.95 mountains of soul food, which you can top off with a slice of fluffy sweet potato pie for $1.25. A couple of blocks away, across from the Krispy Chic, a jolly white-haired man sells baseball-sized tomatoes and boiled peanuts out of the back of a pickup under a rainbow-colored umbrella. At opposite ends of Duval Street are a prison surrounded by high fences topped with coils of razor wire and the new elementary school with its gleaming blue metal roof. At the center of it all, literally and figuratively, is Claxton Chrysler Dodge, sporting colorful helium-filled balloons and blue paint bleached pale by the scorching Southern sun. ""We've been on this corner for 40 years,"" Shontz said inside his small office, looking out toward Duval Street. ""We could stand out there and have 50 or 60 people wave at us before the day is out that know us -- 'Hey man! How y'all doin'? Hang in there!' "" In a small town, everybody knows you and knows what you're up to, Shontz said. ""Everybody goes by here. I don't care who you are, everybody goes by here at least once a day,"" he said. And people in Claxton know whom they can count on for help with their causes and events and fundraisers. Over the years, Claxton Chrysler has sponsored Little League baseball and Pee Wee football, supported beauty pageants and donated to local charities, Shontz said. ""We've bought more chicken dinners, and junk, and stuff ... rodeos ... parades ... there's always something,"" Womack said with a chuckle. ""Everything's a big deal here."" ""I've never seen so many 'Misses,' "" Shontz added as they both laughed the kind of laugh you hear toward the end of the third day at the funeral home. Chrysler LLC doesn't understand its market, said loyal customer Jerry Akins, 64, who has bought three vehicles from Claxton Chrysler. ""How the hell they gon' sell to those people in small towns?"" he said. ""They're a different breed. They're not gonna go no damn hundred miles to buy a car."" Akins' loyalty extends to his sons, both of whom have bought cars from Claxton Chrysler. But that's not unusual around here. Salesman Paul Michel said he's sold 11 vehicles to one family since December 2005. ""That's that generational thing I was talking about,"" Shontz said.  Watch what happened to Michigan's oldest Dodge dealer » . Womack intends to stay in business as a used car dealer after the agreement with Chrysler ends June 9, but it will be a very different operation. With no warranty work, the service and parts departments will be closed, Shontz said. ""I just hired a new parts guy three weeks ago,"" he said. ""He left a great job to come here. And now I told him I'm probably going to have to let him go. Great guy, real smart, knows Chrysler like the back of his hand. And I feel bad that I've put him in that kind of predicament."" Almost as an afterthought, Shontz mentioned that he'll probably lose his own job, as will 800 of his counterparts across the corporation. ""There's going to be a lot of me's out there looking for work. General managers will be a dime a dozen."" The change will have a ripple effect on other businesses, Shontz said. The dealer's subcontractors who handle body work, upholstery, dings, glass, used tires, scrap metal and signs all are losing a significant customer, he said.

""We've had more people to pay with a credit card this year than I've ever seen,"" said Joubert, who has been in the tax preparation business for 12 years. ""I feel like a department store in some sense."" The IRS has a monthly payment plan, but it comes with an upfront fee, stiff penalties and interest, making it more costly than a commercial loan.

58,"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- You don't expect to hear an electric saw in church, but Kevin Cross uses the tool along with a frying pan, blender and toaster oven to help free people from debt. Kevin Cross holds the boards steady as a woman uses a reciprocating saw to cut up her credit cards. This money missionary helps people destroy those little plastic shovels, otherwise known as credit cards, that so many people have used to dig their way to financial ruin. ""It's such an easy message. It really is,"" says Cross, an ex-con who credits religion for his conversion from thief to money coach. ""That's why it doesn't take a rocket scientist, it doesn't take a CPA to do it. A first-year bookkeeper can figure out that you can't spend more than you make,"" he said. Earlier this month, Cross spoke to about 150 people at the Miami Vineyard Community Church where Kevin Fischer is the pastor. ""You've got to plan your spending; you've got to give back a part to God. You've got to save for the future, and you've got to learn to be content,"" said Fischer. Fischer says the pressure of money and debt is enormous on people, especially more recently. ""We should change the marriage vows from 'till death do us part' to 'debt do us part' because that's what's going on, and it's so true,"" he said. Cross is breathless. As he speaks to the crowd, he's a non-stop, doesn't-come-up-for-air, high-octane money missionary. He uses Christian principles, prayer, common sense, and a few good one-liners to get his message across. ""I had a 401k, it went to a 201k, went to 101k, now it's just K,"" he said as the crowd laughs. ""I'm thinking I got a thousand bucks left, and I can retire for about a week."" Cross presides over a day-long sermon on how people can make their lives better by taking control of their spending. He says he tries to demonstrate the long-term effects of irresponsible borrowing. Simple stuff, he says, will make people more content and give them the cushion necessary to give back. His new book is ""Building Your Financial Fortress in 52 Days."" ""I want to get people to have more margin, so instead of investing in stuff, and stuff that doesn't last, they can invest in people's lives,"" he said. The tools he uses to hammer home his message go beyond his overhead TV screens, charts and calculators. Cross invites his guests, who pay $25 a head to hear his message, to come up to the front of the room for what he calls the beginning of ""freedom."" On a table, sit a frying pan, a toaster oven, a blender and a wooden sawhorse and an electric saw. About six people cut up their credit cards and bake them in the toaster oven as if they were TV dinners. Others sliced and diced their Visa, MasterCard and Amex, before mixing the pieces with Spam in the blender. At one point, Cross called for some cooking oil as one lady stood over her credit card-saute with a spatula. Holding a plate full of the little pieces of credit card, Cross said, ""This looks like a melted credit card, but this really represents freedom in these people's lives, because it's the first step."" Cellie Mayol says she used to have 10 or 11 credit cards. She put on protective goggles, taped her cards to a two-by-four and shredded them with a reciprocating saw.

Cross was a bookkeeper and skimmed money from an account filled by payments from court judgments. He invested the stolen funds and profited about $50,000 before he was caught. He was charged with fraud and theft, and spent minimal time in jail. He paid half the money back. But, he says, that was another life ago. Cross says it took him four years to crawl out of his own hole; He was $100,000 in debt. ""I could spend a thousand dollars a day,"" Cross told the crowd. ""Although, I'd have to spend about two days recovering from that -- you know what I mean,"" he said. ""I completely sabotaged my life, all in one year. I did more damage in one year than most people do in their whole life."" One night, as a 20 year old, he says, he was parking cars at Miami's Hyatt Regency hotel. He was wearing black ladies garden shoes, because he couldn't afford the black sneakers that were part of his uniform. A Jaguar pulled up, and inside was one of Miami's most recognizable newsmen, anchorman Dwight Lauderdale. He took the car, turned on the radio, and heard a Christian financial expert say, ""There is hope for the hopeless. All you have to do is give your heart and soul to the Lord."" ""And then, I thought, oh Lord, if you're there. I need you."" ""I wasn't going to find satisfaction in money. The only place I was going to find it was outside of that, and I found it, in turning my heart over to God."" He became a CPA and spends one full day each week doing free financial counseling for needy people. He says he no longer gets high on money. He only helps people understand that they can manage their money in a way that can help themselves, their families and others. Juan and Beth Diaz were at the seminar.

Gardenhire is talking about her makeshift home called an EDAR, which stands for Everyone Deserves A Roof. The units are being distributed to homeless people in the Los Angeles area by the Everyone Deserves A Roof nonprofit organization. It's the brainchild of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" movie producer Peter Samuelson, who has spent much of his life working with charities to help impoverished children. He got the idea to help the homeless in recent years as he rode his bicycle from Los Angeles to the beach at Santa Monica.  Watch a canvas-covered 'home' for the homeless » . On those bike rides, he began seeing more and more homeless people. But he didn't just whiz by. He stopped to talk with them -- 62 people in all. One by one, he listened to their needs and what they wanted most: a roof over their heads. And the idea for the EDAR was born. iReport.com: Homeless in pink tents . ""If you had to define the value of a civilization, it's not how many SUVs you've got,"" Samuelson said. ""To me, I think it's how well do we take care of our children, our homeless people, our mentally ill, those less fortunate."" He partnered with the Pasadena Art Center College of Design for a design contest and the current contraption was created. Each unit costs about $500 to make. The four-wheeled home has an expandable base that stays off the ground and is covered by a canvas, giving it the feel of a tent. It extends 86 inches and is 32 inches wide, thin enough to fit through standard doorways. Each unit has a mattress and sleeping bag to provide comfort. It's also flame-retardant and sturdy enough to keep its occupants dry during heavy rains. A braking mechanism prevents the unit from rolling away at night. They also come with a chain and padlock to prevent it from being stolen. Samuelson said he initially wanted to build more permanent shelters for all of the homeless people in the Los Angeles area. ""But when you do the math, you're looking at $3 billion to get 60,000 people off the damp concrete, and that's just in L.A.,"" he said, explaining why he opted for the cheaper EDAR instead of permanent shelters. He said the EDAR isn't a perfect solution, but it's a good, economical stopgap. ""This is $500 to get a man or a woman or a child off the damp concrete,"" he said. ""I don't think it's the best. ... But for now, I think a little bit of privacy -- not being rained on, not sleeping on the ground, not getting pneumonia from the damp -- has a little bit of value."" Jose Font, 50, agrees. He got an EDAR late last year. He said he's been homeless off and on since 1979. He slept on a tarp with a blanket and worked on computer repairs before he became one of about 60 people to get an EDAR. ""Everybody calls it the hobo condo. Everybody envies me because I sleep on a mattress inside,"" he said. ""It makes me feel like I've got something to come to. It feels more like a home than just a tarp and concrete."" He added, ""It's light as a feather when I push it. I can put it anywhere."" Font keeps it locked to a telephone on public property when he's away. James Ramirez, a social worker with the Venice Community Housing Corporation, said he has been able to use the EDAR as incentive to get people's lives back on track. ""What we're doing is using the EDAR as a carrot for them to come in to see us,"" Ramirez said. ""They want the EDAR because they want to keep dry when it's raining and they want a place to stay at night that's comfortable. So we're using this to connect with them."" ""For us, it's working really well,"" he said. ""This is their home. This is what they're proud of at this moment. ... It means a step in the right direction to get back into society."" The EDAR organization says it's starting with baby steps. In addition to the 60 units already given out, another 110 units have been ordered. The units are distributed to shelters, churches and other organizations that help the homeless. Those groups then distribute the units. The EDAR group tries to stay in phone contact with its users every week or two. EDAR.org: How you can help . EDAR currently has about 30 people on a waiting list, plus another 10 shelters in the Los Angeles area. The organization is also looking at land provided by a local authority where they could let women and families stay on a site that also has functioning bathrooms. EDAR has fielded dozens more calls from across the country and around the world about the units. Samuelson said they're ""studying what works best"" and looking at an array of options. ""People talk about the homeless as if it's some homogeneous group of drunken, unemployed, too-lazy-to-get-a-job men. They're totally wrong. They need to come meet people,"" he said. ""What's the point in having a society if it's devoid of helping people less fortunate?"" He added, ""As we raise money, we will get people off the concrete."" For Brenda Gardenhire, that means the world. ""It's a step up to you. It's like you're making progress,"" she said. ""Now, I have me a little place to stay. I'm moving up.""

60,"(CNN) -- As Walter Thomas knows, it's hard to look for a job when your stomach is rumbling. Samirah, 2, asked her mom to take this photo to show that hungry people ""are like everyone else."" The 52-year-old from Washington, D.C.,  started skipping meals in early January when his savings account was running dry and his kitchen cabinets were almost empty. Thomas at first didn't want to turn to the United States' food safety net, the food stamp program, for help. But after being laid off in July from what seemed like a steady job in sales at a furniture store, Thomas swallowed his pride and applied for the monthly food aid. ""It lets me think, 'OK, well, tomorrow I'll be able to eat. If nothing else, I'll be able to eat,' "" he said. With the national economy in meltdown, more Americans than ever are relying on the federal aid program to keep from going hungry. In October, more than one in 10 people -- about 31 million -- were using the food stamp program to get by, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. More recent numbers are not available, but advocates for the poor say the number of those in need of aid probably has increased since then. Stereotypes associated with food stamps abound, and recipients are often seen as prone to taking handouts, sometimes when they may not be needed. But the profile of hunger in America is multifaceted, as diverse as the nation itself, especially in these times of economic hardship. To get a better idea of what it's like to live on a food stamp budget, CNN correspondent Sean Callebs has decided to eat for a month on $176 and blog about the experience on CNN.com.  Watch reporter's struggle to buy food with food stamps » . That's a situation many people, Thomas included, can relate to. Thomas, who said he had been working steadily since he was 13 years old, now receives $175 per month for food. That's about $5.83 per day -- less than $2 per meal.  See what people on food stamps can buy » . Not that Thomas is complaining. After getting his first payment, which is added to an inconspicuous debit card to reduce the stigma associated with the program, Thomas went straight to the grocery store. He was hungry and grateful. ""It's definitely been a blessing to me,"" he said of the food stamp program, which, since October, has gone by the name Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Advocates for the poor, as well as those on federal assistance, hope President Obama's economic stimulus plan will increase food stamp payments. The average family on food stamps would receive $79 more per month if the stimulus bill passes in the U.S. Senate this week, according to The New York Times. iReport.com: How are you doing in this tough economy? There is some debate about whether giving people money to spend on groceries is a valid form of economic stimulus. Few are more hopeful the measure will pass than Crystal Sears, a 30-year-old mother in Germantown, Pennsylvania, who said she has been on food stamps for more than three years. Sears said she sometimes skips meals so her three children can eat. Even with federal assistance, she said, she sometimes has to make a meal for herself out of crackers or food scraps. She said she has been out of work for several years because all three of her children have medical conditions: Her 8-year-old son has a seizure disorder that requires frequent hospital visits and constant attention; her 2-year-old daughter was born with heart problems; and her 12-year-old daughter has scoliosis, a back condition that recently required two surgeries, she said. Without much money, she's forced to make tough choices. ""If the kids needed sneakers and their sneakers are getting too small, or if my water bill is past due, I'd opt not to pay it and risk them sending me a shut-off notice just so my children can eat,"" she said. Sometimes she chooses to buy more food instead of paying her gas bill to heat her home. When she does, the family sleeps huddled around their stove or an electric heater, she said. Her monthly food stamp payment is $489, she said. That's sometimes sufficient. But some months, she said, she doesn't receive full payments because of mix-ups with paperwork. Until recently, she said, she received about $250 per month, which she said was far from enough to feed her family of four. The SNAP program is meant to supplement a person's food budget, not cover all food expenses, said Jean Daniel, a spokesperson for the USDA, which administers the program. Taking on part-time work would further complicate the application process, she said. Sears said she worked for seven years at a Salvation Army shelter before becoming unemployed. ""For me, I've always been a helper. And my thing is I don't like to help people to enable them. I like to help people so they can help themselves in the long run,"" she said. Sears stretches her food budget by buying cheap and sometimes fatty meals. She said she doesn't like doing that but can't avoid it. With food prices high, she said, grocery shopping is stressful. ""We get like the mac and cheese, which is dehydrated cheese -- basically food that's no good for you health wise,"" she said. ""Everything is high in sodium and trans fats ... and that's all we basically can afford. There's not enough assistance to eat healthy and maintain a healthy weight."" Advocates for the hungry say many people on the food stamp program opt to buy less-healthy foods because they can't afford fresh fruits and vegetables on such a tight budget. Food stamp ""benefits aren't really enough for a healthy diet,"" said Jim Weill, president of the nonprofit Food Research and Action Center. Sears said she is grateful for the help she does get. Maribel Diaz, a 36-year-old mother of three boys in Los Angeles, California, said her $319-per-month payment isn't always enough. But she said she would starve herself before letting her boys go hungry. ""You're bringing home less bags [of food] now, because the milk is almost $5 a gallon and the bread is $3 a loaf. ... A chicken is, like, now $8,"" Diaz said. ""If you're really breaking it down, you're not bringing a lot of groceries home."" All SNAP recipients are eligible for free nutritional counseling to help people stretch their food budgets, said Daniel, of the USDA. Advocates for the hungry find flaws in the way the program is set up, but they praise it for being a safety net the government can't take away during tough times. Unlike aid to soup kitchens, the food stamp program receives federal funding in times thick and thin, and has a $6 billion backup fund, Daniel said. ""The money will be found so people are not turned away,"" Daniel said. All of the benefits paid to participants come from the federal government. States split the program's administrative costs. Advocates see some flaws in SNAP but generally give it praise. ""I say about food stamps what Winston Churchill said about democracy: 'It's the worst possible system except all the others,' "" said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York Coalition Against Hunger. Berg said the program's benefits are too small and too difficult for people to obtain. But the food stamp program is somewhat successful, he said. ""The main purpose of the program is to wipe out Third World starvation in America, and it's worked,"" he said, adding that he's optimistic about improvements that could come as part of the economic stimulus plan. Thomas, the laid-off furniture worker in Washington, said he doesn't want people to feel sorry for him. After being let go from his store, he stopped at an employment center before going anywhere else. He said he faxed about 20 résumés to similar companies on that very day. None has resulted in a job yet, but Thomas said he has been to interviews for other types of work and hopes employment will come soon. For now, he's just happy to continue the job search without the pain of hunger nagging at his stomach.",0.621132,5594
61,"(CNN) -- If an e-mail popped up in your inbox promising a house for $100, you'd expect to see it sent from a guy in Nigeria asking you to wire him several thousand dollars first. Zeb Smith lies on his front lawn and spends a quiet afternoon with his neighbors. But this depressed housing market dream is real. And Detroit, Michigan, artist Jon Brumit and his wife, Sarah, are living it. The couple never counted on owning a home. ""It's not that we have a little money,"" Jon Brumit said, laughing. ""I'm saying we have no money."" But the couple began entertaining the idea of a permanent nest when their friends Mitch Cope and Gina Reichert, also artists, started taking advantage of foreclosures in the city, where the average home price dipped to $11,533 in April, according to the Detroit Association of Realtors. Dragging down the average are homes that are long abandoned or foreclosed on that are selling for pennies on the dollar. Detroit already had the lowest market value houses in Michigan before the latest rounds of job losses at GM and other huge employers, market analysts say. ""Those artists are doing a good thing; they are at least helping to stabilize neighborhoods that would be all but lost,"" said Mike Shedlock, an investment adviser who blogs frequently about Detroit's economy. For less than a few thousand dollars, Cope and Reichert snapped up a dilapidated bungalow in a north Detroit neighborhood called ""BanglaTown,"" for its unexpected mix of Bangladeshis, African-Americans, Polish and Ukrainians and the occasional shady character. Scrappers had cleaned the house to the bone. The copper had been stolen; the electrical wiring was stripped. But no matter. Here was a chance for Cope and Reichert, who run a popular Detroit art store, to rehabilitate the 1920s brick house into a bastion of energy savings, with solar panels, LED lights, recycled wood and high-end insulated windows. They're installing a security system that exemplifies elegant efficiency with hurricane-proof windows and steel doors replacing burglar bars. They are also experimenting with running their air-conditioning on a car battery. The project became known as the Power House. Cope and Reichert wanted to create a central place to power homes nearby and, in turn, revive a neighborhood's sense of community. The trick was getting their friends not only to cheer the concept but invest in it by moving next door. ""It was much easier than we thought it might be,"" Cope said. ""We told everyone that Detroit is an interesting city to work in as an artist, and the neighborhood is diverse. But, really, it came down to money."" ""I kept telling Mitch, 'Wow those are an awesome, ridiculously good deals but if you find anything that's less, let me know,"" Brumit said. ""Like, if something comes along for next to nothing, cool."" A few weeks later, Cope e-mailed Brumit a photo of an abandoned home on his block. Its windows were boarded up and plywood was nailed across the front door. The huge hole in the roof was courtesy of the fire department. A neighbor said the house had been set on fire -- twice. Pricetag: $100. Brumit called a real estate agent with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who confirmed that bids on the foreclosed property started at $95 for the property, $5 for the house. There were no back taxes -- no one seemed to be sure who once owned the house, it had been empty for so long, Brumit said. Cope, also a designer and builder, and an inspector did a walk-through. ""Inspection was fine and Mitch told me the foundation was good,"" Brumit said. ""He just said, 'If you didn't mind scraping some peeling paint, doing some surface treatments, putting in new utilities, windows and repairing the roof ... this could be pretty interesting.'"" Now, when he's not hauling loads of rubble away or knocking out walls to create a single, open studio space, Brumit's searching Craigslist for a furnace. In exchange for designing the business Web site of a local barn recycler, he's getting materials to turn that hole in his roof into a skylight. ""I saw it as a project,"" the artist said. ""I'm a builder. I've been building skateboards since I was 12."" Skateboards are one thing. Rebuilding homes where the plumbing has been ripped out or the cabinets destroyed in a fit by an upset foreclosed homeowner is another. Michigan housing authorities acknowledge that there's little incentive for people who aren't quite as handy as Brumit. In two weeks, the state will begin offering $25,000 to anyone who buys a home, as long as they pay 1 percent of the total cost and live in it.  Landlords or speculators aren't eligible. Part of a $263 million grant given to Michigan and other states under 2008's Housing and Economic Recovery Act, the funds are intended to help buyers bring trashed properties up to code, according to Mary Townley, a director with the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. She and other housing officials CNN spoke with said Michigan's economy has some extremely frustrating woes. A report from the nonprofit think tank Brookings Institution said Detroit had the lowest performing economy out of 100 U.S. cities it analyzed -- scoring the worst in unemployment and average wages, the highest foreclosure rates and the lowest market value homes. The artists in BanglaTown are careful to say they are not looking to change a city. Their goal is simply to improve a neighborhood, one house at a time. New neighbors, freelance photographer Corine Vermeulen-Smith and her husband Zeb Smith, a designer, are always checking out www.freecycle.com, where a stainless steel kitchen sink can be bought for $65. The Smiths bought their 660-square-foot home for $549.99 from Cope and Reichert, who originally purchased the foreclosed home for $500. ""We knew the property, we knew it had been sitting there empty for at least a year, and it had been trashed,"" Vermeulen-Smith said. ""But we wanted to own a home."" All the copper in their ""micro-home"" had been ripped out, as well as every electrical outlet, Vermeulen-Smith said. Trash had to be hauled out in several loads. ""You have to get over that fear that the house had that history, that you're going to be a victim of a crime or something,"" she said. ""Crime is everywhere. My husband and I have lived in the city for a long time; we know that people look out for each other here. We don't have that kind of fear."" Careful not to entice thieves again, the Smiths replaced the copper with plastic. They are considering taking the home completely off the grid by installing a mini-wind turbine, but for now they are happy to put in the basics. A bathtub from Habitat for Humanity cost them $100. And Zeb Smith, who works at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, brings home wood the museum would otherwise toss when installations close. ""This is, for us, very exciting to believe that we could totally reinvent a space,"" she said, ""and prove that having a home isn't about having money.""",0.6211225,5786

""I said, 'Don't mess with me.' "" Space played hardball with co-worker Oscar Oviedo, who hadn't paid him yet for his share of the lottery tickets. ""This morning, I come into work early with him,"" said Oviedo, who soon received an instant message from Space. ""I got a surprise for you. Come over,"" the message said. Oviedo went to Space's cubicle. ""He's like, 'You got my money?' "" Oviedo said he thought, ""Wow, that was rude,"" but paid up. Space shook his hand and said: ""Now you're a millionaire."" They aren't officially millionaires at this point, because the winning ticket hasn't been presented to lottery officials yet. ""In due time,"" Space said. ""We have a year."" But another Chubb employee said they'll cash in their ticket soon. ""If you have that winning ticket ... please sign the back of the ticket, put it in a safe place and seek legal and financial advice before you come to talk to us,"" New Jersey Lottery spokesman Dominick DeMarco said at the news conference, held at the gas station where the winning ticket was sold. ""Be careful with it."" None of the co-workers, who have been with Chubb for seven to 30 years, said they had immediate plans to quit. The ticket is worth an estimated $216 million if the money is paid out over 26 years, or about $140 million if they choose an immediate cash payout. ""It relieves a lot of stress ... and it also gives a nice cushion to be able to help the people we want to help,"" Ellis said. ""I feel incredibly blessed. I can't even absorb it at this point.""

63,"(CNN) -- Almost three years after losing her right leg in a bomb explosion in Iraq, Tara Hutchinson decided to post her photo and profile online to ask for help. Dave Mahler spent his entire career in technology and decided to apply his know-how to help veterans. The soldier was having financial problems last fall and needed $1,000 for one month's mortgage on her house in San Antonio, Texas, where she is being treated for her injuries. Her husband, who is also in the Army, is still deployed in Iraq. Hutchinson, 32, is among dozens of active-duty U.S. troops and veterans who have asked for help through USAtogether.org, which listed their stories and specific needs online. The charity is one of many set up to help U.S. troops beyond the compensation and benefits the government offers, but it's not run by a church group, a veterans association or even a military family.  Watch how some veterans are having tough times back home » . Instead, it was founded by a group of Silicon Valley professionals in California. The project is the brainchild of Dave Mahler, whose résumé includes an engineering degree, 13 years at Hewlett-Packard designing servers and software, co-founding a start-up and serving on nonprofit boards -- but no military background. Mahler also happens to live four miles from a Veterans Affairs hospital in Palo Alto, which he had driven past for 25 years but never visited, he said. It was on his mind a year and a half ago when he was looking for a new community service project and decided to focus his energy on helping U.S. troops hurt in the line of duty. Hatching a plan over coffee . Mahler described what he did next as a ""very startup-oriented thing."" He called a senior person at the hospital out of the blue and invited her out for coffee to learn how he could help. Mahler said he was ready to sweep the halls or read to a veteran but envisioned something with more leverage. ""I had a bias towards wanting to use the things that we've learned in Silicon Valley and across the country in building Internet properties to apply that technology into this arena,"" Mahler said. So after finding out that there was usually an outpouring of help once a community knew about a veteran's financial plight, he decided to start a Web site showcasing specific stories and needs. Anyone who wanted to help could browse through the requests and decide exactly whom to support. Mahler, 52, said the goal was to get rid of all the bureaucracy in the process by combining elements of Craigslist -- the popular go-to place for online classifieds and forums -- and Kiva.org, a micro-lending Web site that lets users browse profiles of entrepreneurs in the developing world and choose someone to give a small loan to. ""The unique thing about Kiva, and to some extent Craigslist, is that it's one to one. You're not giving money to some organization and then they decide who to give it to,"" Mahler said. Visitors to USAtogether.org can search for requests by ZIP code, branch of service or type of need. Requests can be filled quickly, so the organization is looking for more service members and their families to list their needs, Mahler said. A recent visit to the site showed only two open appeals for help. Hutchinson said her request for assistance with a mortgage payment was filled within a couple of months of posting and has made a big difference. ""There are a lot of people who believe that Americans are not giving, [but] I think that we're the most giving culture in the world,"" Hutchinson said. ""I am so grateful that there are people who were willing to help me."" Volunteers stay connected . Hutchinson didn't have any apprehension about posting her story online. But for some visitors, the pictures and requests for baby items, appliances and even job leads can be uncomfortable to see, Mahler said. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs declined to comment on whether it had any qualms about veterans listing their stories on the site. ""That's a personal choice,"" said VA spokesman Jim Benson. USAtogether has no office or employees, keeping the operation ""outrageously efficient,"" Mahler said. The handful of Silicon Valley professionals who run the nonprofit organization work on a volunteer basis out of their homes, using Skype conference calls, text messages and other technology to communicate. The volunteers check out service members, who must meet eligibility criteria. They also make sure the requests are appropriate and within limits. Direct financial assistance is limited to $1,000, for example, and someone asking for a plasma-screen TV might be coached to request help with an electric bill instead. The assistance is meant to be a short-term safety net, so service members with recurring financial problems are referred to the many other groups that help veterans. Hearing the service members' stories can take a toll on the team, Mahler said. ""I've spent my entire career in technology, and the reality of it is, when you're building the next widget that's smaller or faster or cheaper, it's really impersonal,"" Mahler said. ""In this case, you're focusing on people's lives, and it's a very emotional business. It is draining when you first hear the stories. But that is for the most part balanced when we're able to get folks assistance.""",0.616655,2559
64,"(CNN) -- Despite the steady drum-beat of economic news, therapists say money is still one of the most taboo subjects for American families. Keli Lauric, 30, and her grandmother, Evelyn Gloer, 79, view money based on life experience. ""It's easier to talk about sex than it is to talk about money in our societies,"" says Dr. Nancy Molitor, a psychologist in Illinois. And that's too bad, because all of us have something to learn from each other, says Molitor. Often, generations seem like they're speaking different languages when it comes to saving and spending money. Older people tend to save, while younger generations wrestle with the fallout from overspending.   Experts say people's spending habits often reflect the environment in which they grew up. To find out how families view money during the economic recession, CNN.com sat down with two multigenerational families. The four-generation Merriweather family worries its younger members may have been spoiled by the economic high tide of the 1990s and early 2000s. Marvin Merriweather, 65, says a person's spending habits are derived from life experience. If your life was hard, you save; if you've got it made, you tend to spend, he says.  Watch the Merriweather family talk about money » . ""I think a lot of the fault falls to us as the older generation by not teaching [financial skills], because we try so hard to make it better for our children."" The three-generation Gloer family says families need to remember to lean on each other during the hard times. ""Life's what you make it. I still say that,"" says Evelyn Gloer, 79. ""I mean, you don't have to be rich to have a happy home."" Olivia Mellon, a money coach who organizes multigenerational family retreats to talk about spending, says older generations are more inclined to hoard money because they've lived through difficult times. Now, ""we have a culture of addictive overspenders,"" she says. But, with the recession, there are signs spending habits are trending back toward the Depression era, she says. ""Some people are getting much more frugal and much more risk-averse,"" Mellon says. Keli Lauric, Gloer's 30-year-old granddaughter, says she spent her money freely in her 20s, living in New York. Now in Atlanta, Georgia, she owns two houses because she can't find a way to sell or rent one of them. Like many people, she's had to cut back. The recession has ""made everyone realize you have to live on a budget all the time, even when times are good,"" she said. Dr. April Benson, a psychologist and author of books on compulsive spending, said this is a good time for families to bond over experiences instead of purchases. Molitor, the family therapist, said many Baby Boomers grew up with a sense of entitlement about money. Now, many of them are terrified because they may have to put off retirement because their savings accounts dwindled as markets fell. Older generations tend to save more, she said. Many avoid credit because they remember hard times after the Great Depression. iReport.com: What have you learned from past generations? Families can use the economic recession as a chance to band together and learn from each other, she says. ""This is an opportunity. As much as this is very painful, many people are actually using this as a challenge and they're actually rising above this,"" she says. Molitor said children should be involved in financial planning from an early age. At about age 8, they should be able to understand if the family is under financial stress, so it's best to see what they can contribute. Dr. Barbara Lips, on the other hand, says children should be involved in financial planning, but should not be made aware of family money problems at a young age. ""If [children] have a sense that mom and dad are OK then they are OK,"" says Lips, a psychologist in Iowa. ""Mom and dad being OK really is their sense of security."" Molitor says she's seen a wave of families come to her to talk about money and the stress it's causing them. Often, what they need is to talk to each other, says Molitor. The Gloer family agrees. Melanie Burns, Evelyn's 53-year-old daughter, says families should band together in hard times.   ""That's what family's for ... We're here to support each other if we need it."" ""Right, when somebody falls down we pick them up,"" Evelyn Gloer responded.",0.61588776,2133
65,"(CNN)  -- After nearly 150 years in business, the Rocky Mountain News published its final edition Friday, the victim of a bad economy and the Internet generation. The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado, published its last edition Friday after 150 years. The final front-page headline simply says: ""Goodbye, Colorado."" ""It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to you today. Our time chronicling the life of Denver and Colorado, the nation and the world, is over."" The Rocky Mountain News' owner, E.W. Scripps Co., made the announcement to the newsroom at noon Thursday, ending three months of speculation and drama over its fate. The News had been put up for sale in December. The Rocky Mountain News was the latest victim in an era of shutdowns, layoffs and cutbacks plaguing the newspaper industry. ""It's in a free fall and nobody knows where the bottom is. It's kind of like water in the toilet swirling around and nobody knows what's left when you're done flushing,"" media critic Eric Alterman said.  Watch how the economy and Internet are taking a toll on the industry » . Newspapers across the country are under pressure as readership declines, along with advertising revenue, while more and more Americans get their information online. ""All newspapers are under great pressure. They'll survive, but they'll survive in different forms, their costs base will have to be dramatically lowered,"" said Mort Zuckerman, publisher of the New York Daily News, which has the seventh highest circulation in the country. The dramatic decline in advertising dollars in a brutal economy has forced newspapers to cut costs by firing cartoonists, columnists and others, leaving them searching for jobs in a struggling industry. Pia Catton lost her job as arts editor of the New York Sun five months ago, when the newspaper closed. She has taken a short-term job editing a book, but she thinks she may need to look at different careers soon. ""There will always be a market for news, you will always need to know immediately what's happening. Will there be a market for newspapers? That's another question,"" she said. The Rocky Mountain News had more than 200 editorial employees, according to the Columbia Journalism Review's Web site. Rich Boehne, chief executive officer of Scripps, told employees the newspaper was the victim of a terrible economy, an upheaval in the newspaper industry and multimillion-dollar annual losses. ""Denver can't support two newspapers any longer,"" Boehne said. ""It's certainly not good news for you, and it's certainly not good news for Denver.""

66,"(CNN) -- Kate Meinhardt felt like a clown jammed into a Volkswagen bug when she lived in a 21-square-foot room aboard a circus train. Kate Meinhardt crammed her life into a 21-square-foot room while she lived aboard a circus train. Bungee cords crisscrossed her walls once a week to prevent an avalanche of items from raining down. A microwave, mini refrigerator, her laptop and baskets of personal items lined the dorm-like room. Showering, going to the bathroom and even doing laundry became racing contests on the train, Meinhardt said. The 13 people on board shared one shower, two toilets and one washer and dryer. ""It's a pretty tough life living in such a small space,"" she said. The 23-year-old spent almost a year as an animal handler for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. While most iReporters haven't run off to join the circus, some have traded in their homes for smaller digs. One iReporter even opted for a floating lifestyle, where he could sail away at a moment's notice. iReport.com: Living in tight quarters . Living on a 25-foot boat was only supposed to be temporary, but Jim Smith loved it so much he stayed there for a year. ""I have lived in a 25-foot sailboat, a 28-foot motor home, a 32-foot sailboat and now an 800 square-foot apartment,"" Smith said in his iReport. ""I was happiest with the 25-foot sailboat."" While docked in Panama City, Florida, Smith kept his expenses to a minimum. The marina slip rent was only $200 and electricity was included in the rent, he said. The boat did not have refrigeration so Smith kept his food inside an insulated ice box. For 79 cents at the discount grocery store, he could buy a 10-pound bag of ice that would last him several days, even during the summer. Air conditioning wasn't a luxury Smith had either, but fans and sea breezes kept him cool. ""Sometimes the less you have, the more you like it,"" he said. The portable lifestyle also charmed a father-son duo who set out on a yearlong European vacation. A camper van took them wherever they wanted, whenever they wanted. Spencer Pearson and his 15-year-old son, Bryce, bought a 150-square-foot van in Germany for their European excursion. Living out of the van meant ""no reservations, no packing and unpacking of suitcases, no strange beds,"" Pearson said. Modern amenities weren't amiss on the van, which included everything from the Internet and entertainment to a complete bath and kitchen, and there were occasional hotel stays and meals out that made the trip more pleasant. The simple life also enticed Deborah Greant and her husband to trade in their Calgary, Canada, home for an RV. Both she and her husband have neuromuscular problems and needed extra help taking care of their large home. Since moving into a 240-square-foot RV, they can manage the house themselves. ""We didn't want to be owned by our things,"" Greant said. ""We jettisoned pretty much everything except things from former generations."" While two people living in an RV can be tight, imagine a family of six trying to do the same. Mounting living expenses and a job relocation prompted the Chervenkas to sell their home and move into a 32-foot RV. Two pets came along, too. The Chervenkas weren't forced to do this. Their goal was to become debt-free and save money for their children's college educations. When pilot Tim Chervenka got transferred to Charlotte, North Carolina, the family set up camp in a 32-foot RV. The temporary situation turned into a permanent one. The family said goodbye to paying a first and second mortgage and pricey utilities. They now pay only $500 a month, utilities included. ""It's made such an adjustment in our personal life without the juggling,"" Cindy Chervenka said. ""We have so much more family time. It's a good feeling."" Cindy Chervenka has some advice for others thinking of a drastic downsizing: ""Step out of your comfort zone and try it. We didn't plan on doing this full-time, but once we discovered it, we thought, 'hey we can do this forever!' Until you step out and try it, you'll think it's not doable.""",0.61088014,1358
68,"FAIRBURN, Georgia (CNN) -- In a south Atlanta neighborhood lined with palatial homes and manicured lots, the Hicks family was living out its American dream. Breylan and Terese Hicks play with their sons Bryce, 3, and Jordan, 2. But like many Americans, that dream was interrupted when they almost lost their home to foreclosure. Terese, a firefighter, and her husband Breylan, a police sergeant, had always dreamed about owning a spacious house in the suburbs. When they began their search, the young family was living in a south Atlanta neighborhood. They grew concerned and decided to move when crime in the area started to pick up. Although they didn't think they could afford their 'dream home,' they started searching in an affluent area just south of the airport and across the street from the 190-room estate owned by famed heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield. ""I've always been looking in this subdivision, but never thought we could afford a home here,"" Terese Hicks said.  After discussing their financials with a mortgage broker, the family was presented with a deal and payments they could afford. The interest-only, adjustable rate loan sounded good at the time. And since they were not first-time homebuyers, they thought they knew what they were getting into. Terese Hicks figured they could always refinance before the interest rates were adjusted. Soon, the family settled in their seven-bedroom, five-bathroom plantation-style home with a pool. It all seemed like a dream come true, until the couple learned the interest rate on their loan would readjust in just six months, making the loan a short three-year ARM. The mother of two, who handles the family's finances, had wrongly assumed that their loan was a five-year ARM. The news couldn't have come at a worse time. Breylan was unable to work because of a serious back injury, and the family's income took a hit. They were also paying mortgages on vacant rental properties when they couldn't find tenants because of the housing crisis.  To make matters worse, Terese Hicks, a city employee, had to take a 10-percent pay cut in her salary, and the family was burdened with a mountain of medical bills for numerous surgeries their 6-month-old son Jordan underwent to treat a birth-related medical condition. Struggling to pay the new adjusted mortgage, Terese Hicks appealed to their mortgage company, Homecomings which is owned by GMAC, for help. ""They said there was nothing they could do about the rate readjusting, so I said let's weather the storm and see what we can do,"" she said. She continued to make regular payments for all of their mortgages in order to maintain their good credit. But within a year, they were in the eye of the storm and their savings dropped to around $75.  Desperate, the Hickses asked their mortgage company again for help. But they were told there was nothing they could do because they were current on all their payments. The Hickses decided they had no other choice but to ""play the game"" and stop paying their mortgage, even if it meant damaging their hard-earned credit. Homecomings acknowledges that the guidelines for modification at that time made little sense, but they were caught in the middle of a ""symptomatic"" relationship between working with third-party investors and homeowners. ""In order for us to have been able to modify the loan we needed to get permission on the investor on whose behalf we are servicing the loan,"" said Jeanine Bruin of GMAC. ""It's a balancing act, what's in the best interest of the customer and the investor.""  At the time of the Hickses request for a loan modification, investors backing the loans required some proof of financial difficulty. Things have changed since then, including new government concessions geared towards helping homeowners, explained Bruin. ""The proof was in the pudding,"" said Bruin, ""You had to be late in your payment to prove hardship."" The Hicks family's story is one that Marcia Griffin, founder of HomeFree-USA, has heard all too often. ""We advise homebuyers not to talk to a realtor or lender before we can meet with them for a Mortgage Profile Meeting,"" said Griffin. ""Within 30 minutes the client will know if they can fly, run, walk or crawl."" HomeFree-USA is a nonprofit organization devoted to homeownership development and financial empowerment. It's one of several national nonprofit organizations that offer mortgage assistance and home ownership counseling. The Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America and the National Urban League offer community advocacy programs geared toward counseling lower- and middle-income families who are purchasing or refinancing their homes.  With offices in Washington and Atlanta, HomeFree-USA's clientele is mostly minority borrowers. During the recent housing crisis, Griffin says people of color have become ""easy prey"" because they often don't know the right questions to ask about subprime and ARM loans. Some may find her no-nonsense attitude a bit difficult to swallow. ""You cannot buy a house without any money, and you cannot buy a house with poor credit,"" cautioned Griffin.  As an African-American, Griffin believes she's the right messenger to help financially empower the African-American community. Griffin believes families like the Hicks could have qualified for a better, less risky loan and should have been better informed about the terms of their loan.  If the Hicks family had known sooner about HomeFree-USA's program they might have been able to save their good credit rating and a lot of aggravation. It was only after receiving notice that their home was going up for auction that Terese Hicks learned about HomeFree-USA.   She contacted the Atlanta office and within a few days there was a resolution. The Hicks family learned that they qualified for President Obama's new homeownership assistance program. The program offered institutionalized loan modifications for people who could prove they were suffering economic hardship. With a low interest rate locked in for the next five years, the family was able to keep the home and pay an affordable monthly mortgage. Griffin hopes other homebuyers can learn from the Hickses' situation and seek out an advocate early in the process of refinancing or modifying a loan -- before they are caught in a financial storm. ""People don't know where to go and who to talk to,"" says Griffin. ""They are suffering in silence.""",0.6108219,4736
69,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Sajida Faraj scoops mashed potatoes and peas onto her plate, not quite sure of the history behind her first Thanksgiving meal. But she knows how thankful she is to be at a church in Atlanta this November, lining up for turkey, stuffing and pecan pie. Sajida Faraj took a break to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal with fellow refugees. Three years ago she grabbed her son, now 12, and fled Iraq. Her husband, a carpenter who worked for Americans, had left for the market one day in Baghdad and never returned. Faraj says she knows he is dead, even though she has never seen his body. When the rest of her family started to receive death threats, she felt she had no choice but to run. Faraj and her son, Ahmed, made it across the border to Syria and later entered the United States, two of more than 15,000 Iraqi refugees to be allowed in since the beginning of the war in 2003. The Thanksgiving meal, served at the Avondale Pattillo United Methodist Church to dozens of refugees from far-flung places like Myanmar and Sudan as well as Iraq, is a welcome break for Faraj, who is struggling to build a new life. Unable to translate her skills as a Baghdad salon owner into a job as a stylist, Faraj does not have the money to pay $625 due in rent. ""I have an electricity bill to pay, I have no job,"" she says. ""I have no way of knowing what to do."" Government and aid group assistance to refugees does not last long. Faraj plans to ask an aid group, the International Rescue Committee, for more help, but she's not sure what else she can do. Soon she hopes her 21-year-old daughter will arrive from Syria and bring with her better luck. ""My daughter is coming and hopefully I will work,"" she says, as Nepali dancers in elaborate costumes entertain the diners. Across the room, more and more refugees line up for the potluck dinner. ""Don't worry, there will be enough food,"" a man tells his two daughters, asking them to wait patiently. The man, Munir, and his wife, Fatima, hoped, like so many immigrants before them, that the United States would help them find a better life for them and their children. But the couple, who asked that their identities be protected for fear of reprisals against their family and friends still in Iraq, are considering ending their American dream after three months of struggle. College-educated and proficient in English, Fatima and Munir were shocked that the skills that provided them a comfortable living in Baghdad, as a mechanical engineer and lab technician, are of little advantage in an increasingly competitive U.S. job market. They spend much of their day at the IRC office in Atlanta, searching for employment, but are considering returning to Jordan, where they say they can find work, albeit illegally. ""I am worried that I will be thrown out on the street,"" Fatima says. ""My Pakistani neighbors couldn't find work and they were evicted and thrown out on the street. We are worried the same will happen to us. Many refugees we know have not found work and they have been here for eight months to a year."" Until 2007, very few Iraqi refugees were resettled in the United States. For 2008, the Bush administration set a goal of accepting 13,000 Iraqis. Most of the estimated 2.2 million people who have fled Iraq since the invasion are in Syria and Jordan, many living illegally. Their presence is straining infrastructure and social services there and driving food and housing prices higher. Far from the warmth of the Thanksgiving party, another Iraqi refugee has managed to find work at a supermarket seafood counter, helping customers with their requests for jumbo shrimp and crab cakes. ""I am like a manager,"" says Muataz, with a glimmer of pride in his eye. ""I thank God that I have a job and that I am lucky."" Muataz, who also asked that his identity be protected, was a college-educated artist and shop owner in Baghdad. He fled Iraq with his wife and three children after he was run off the road and shot in the side on his way home from work. A friend who was with him died in the assault. Muataz is now able to support his family with the aid of food stamps and hopes that his wife will find a job to help out financially. Nevertheless, he has been able to afford Internet service for his children and a car. That kind of American dream is all Faraj wants as she stands at a bus stop, bundled in her head scarf and winter coat, the music and laughter of the IRC Thanksgiving dinner now just a distant memory. She is on her way to the local farmers market, where she plans to spend the morning waiting in line with 40 or 50 other people hoping to work. Faraj says she has hope. ""I wish for my children to be like [the Americans],"" she says in Arabic. ""I wish they would have their own car, home, job -- to be American. ""I wish that because in my country, unfortunately, I did not see that. Not during Saddam's time or this new government. I wish I was still young. I would have left Iraq a long time ago.""",0.61053663,1348
70,"Braddock, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- In 2001, I came to Braddock, the poorest town in Western Pennsylvania, to serve the community's severely disenfranchised young people by starting an employment and GED program. Their lives were the embodiment of what happened to Braddock and this region: chaos through abandonment. However, tough times and severe hardship are nothing new. It's been this way for decades. Once one of the most important steel manufacturing centers in the world, Braddock -- what's left of it -- solemnly affirms one of the great economic maxims of our society: socialism for the rich, and capitalism for the poor. Since the massive banking bailout of 2008, I have often wondered what Braddock would be today, if 35 years ago, the U.S. government also channeled hundreds of billions of dollars (and trillions in guarantees) to save the steel industry, the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs it produced and the families it sustained. Instead, places like Braddock were allowed to descend into decades of disorder, poverty and desertion. Braddock went from a prosperous community of 20,000 residents, to a shattered town of fewer than 3,000 today. Braddock looks every bit the deserted battlefield it truly is: 90 percent of our town's people, buildings, businesses, and homes are gone and what remains, bears witness to the torment. In 2005, those same young people I was privileged to work for helped elect me mayor. Senseless homicides long lost their ability to shock, so I began to tattoo the dates of the killings on my arm as a living document of our collective loss. Upon taking office, we set out to help reinvent Braddock through diverse solutions ranging from effective policing and the arts, to urban agriculture and youth employment. Today, buildings have been saved and repurposed. We farm for organic produce from formerly overgrown land, and can offer full summer employment for our youth. Perhaps most importantly, no dates have been added to my forearm in over 20 months. However, at the start of my second term as mayor, we have decades of work ahead and we'll never come close to replacing what's been taken. As the saying goes, we're not looking for a handout, but a hand up and the chance to ameliorate three decades of socioeconomic unraveling. Towards those ends, the stimulus, known as American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, has been a true fiscal balm, especially since our community's hospital, and largest employer, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center announced it would be shutting Braddock Hospital later this month, taking jobs along with our residents' access to health care. CNN iReport: Share your thoughts on the State of the Union . Braddock received $250,000 in stimulus funding for the EPA compliance upgrade of our sewer system and $30,000 that enabled us to hire an additional 30 young people this past summer who would have otherwise been unemployed. Without question, these stimulus funds were a needed infusion of resources. However, I believe the greatest promise of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 remains untapped and now represents an unprecedented opportunity for growth and renewal. In Braddock and in the surrounding areas, we have an abundance of quality, shovel-ready projects that range in complexity and scope from small-scale urban farming, and retrofitting a now-vacant 300,000 square foot hospital, to a $300 million-dollar repurposing of a former steel mill site into a green enterprise zone of economic redevelopment. Investments like these will not only help reinvent communities like Braddock, but will also foster a boom in job creation and long-term growth. These and similar projects across the country represent but a tiny fraction of the resources spent to save feckless bankers and Wall Street from their own unchecked greed and hubris. Perhaps equally important, I believe this kind of investment will help restore a sense of social justice that is completely absent in today's public debates. Consider the absurd juxtaposition of rescued banking executives defending multi-million-dollar bonuses, to our community at over 30 percent unemployment, widespread abandonment, and pervasive poverty while losing the area's only hospital and access to medical care. The explanation of this circumstance is as simple as the contrast is stark: one got capitalism and the other, socialism. Basic fairness and equity demand that the color of your collar should not dictate if you receive a bail-out or get bailed on. For Americans living in places like Braddock, I believe the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is perhaps the last, best chance to help overcome the injustice and harm that the decades steeped in a laissez-faire orthodoxy have wrought.

71,"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- One of Chicago's most well-known real estate moguls appears to have shot himself to death, police said. Steven Good was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot Monday, police said. The body of Steven L. Good was found in his Jaguar on Monday. The car was spotted in a parking lot of a wildlife preserve in Kane County, Illinois, just outside Chicago, authorities said. No note was found, and police say they do not know how long the 52-year-old had been in the vehicle. Good was the chairman and chief executive officer of Sheldon Good & Co., a major U.S. real estate auction company. The death comes amid great turmoil in the country's real estate industry. In his role as chairman of the Realtors Commercial Alliance Committee, Good commented on tough conditions last month at a business conference. On a memorial blog set up by the Chicago Association of Realtors, for which Good once served as president, friends and colleagues described him as a gregarious man with a big personality. He was a savvy businessman who built his company into a major national real estate company that did deals with Donald Trump, they said. ""It is testimony to Steve's leadership that Sheldon Good & Co. remains well-positioned for the future,"" said Sheldon Good President Alan R. Kravets. ""The guy was a true blue Realtor,"" said Barbara Matthopoulos, the association's spokeswoman. She was new to real estate when she met Good more than a year ago. He took time to give her advice that has helped her grow to love the business. ""Anybody who knew him would speak to his leadership, his generosity, his attitude. The guy was just very positive, always smiling, always telling you a story. He was engaged. Everyone is really very shocked,"" she said. ""I doubt anyone could help explain why this happened."" Kane County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Pat Gengler said authorities don't have any ""concrete evidence if this had anything to do with his finances."" The company was founded by Good's father, Sheldon Good, in 1965, according to the firm's Web site. Steven Good had ""been involved in the sale of more than $4 billion of real estate, including commercial, office, retail, industrial, residential, and vacant land sites,"" it says. ""Mr. Good is the driving force behind the expansion of the company, which has been ranked as the largest firm in the United States exclusively conducting real estate auctions."" Good, who was also an attorney, wrote a book, ""Churches, Jails and Gold Mines: Mega-Deals From a Real Estate Maverick."" According to Amazon.com, Donald Trump wrote the afterword. The first chapter begins, ""Our auction company is to the real estate business what Sotheby's and Christie's is the fine art and collectibles business."" The book goes to say that as of its 2003 publication, the firm had sold 40,000 properties totaling $8 billion. ""If you lined up 1,000 people and said pick the one that might do this to themselves, he would be the last person I would choose,"" said Wayne Caplan, who worked at Sheldon Good for six years and knew Steven Good personally.

73,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- One day while driving with her father, Hannah Salwen noticed a Mercedes stopped next to a homeless man sitting on the curb. The Salwen family of Atlanta, Georgia, has decided to sell this house and give half the proceeds to charity. ""I said to my dad, 'If that guy didn't have such a nice car, then that guy could have a nice meal,' "" the 15-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, recalled. And so began the tale of what the Salwen family calls ""Hannah's Lunchbox.""  Watch why family wants to give away $800K » . It started as family discussions about what they needed versus what was enough. Hannah's father Kevin, an entrepreneur, is on the board of the Atlanta Habitat for Humanity and is no stranger to community work, but he said this family conversation was life-changing. ""We stopped and paused and thought about what are the things in the world that could really make a difference, a little bit of difference in the world,"" he said. They talked about selling their cars or other things, but it was Hannah's mother, Joan, who came up with selling their 6,500-square-foot house, donating half the proceeds and then moving into a house half the size. For nine years, the family lived in a historic 1912 mansion near downtown Atlanta. It boasts five bedrooms, eight fireplaces, a kitchen that would make any cook jealous and even an elevator.  See the new and old houses, side by side » . When Hannah would bring friends over, she said, often their jaws would drop and they'd gasp, ""Wow, you live here?"" Like most teens, Hannah loves to shop, and she jammed every space of her massive walk-in closet full of clothes. But she also knows many people are less fortunate; she volunteers at a local community food bank and other relief agencies. Joan Salwen, a teacher, said the mansion was her dream home. ""It was a challenge,"" she said of giving up that house. ""It was a test, almost, to see: How committed are we? I mean, how serious are these kids about what we should do? And they all nodded and there we were."" So the Salwens put the house up for sale in May 2007 and started figuring out what they would do with half the proceeds, which would amount to more than $800,000. They spent six months researching charity organizations before deciding on the Hunger Project, an organization dedicated to helping end world hunger through people helping themselves. Hunger Project Vice President John Coonrod said the family met with organizers in New York and notified them months later that the charity was the winner. When the Salwen house sells, the money will be channeled through The Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta over a six-year period and end up in Ghana, Coonrod said. ""This will underwrite a process in more than 30 villages to enable people to meet all of their basic needs on a sustainable basis,"" he said. ""They will be able to grow enough food, to build clinics and schools, and the villagers will be doing the lion's share of the work."" Coonrod said he'd never heard of a family donating in this way. ""Hannah's awakening to social injustice, and her family's ability to make a difference in that issue will make a profound difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people,"" he said, estimating the money could affect more than 20,000 people in Ghana. Hannah's 13-year-old brother, Joseph, was so impressed with his big sister's ideas that he made a three-minute video of the family's project.  Watch Joseph's video . The video won the grand prize in the 2008 ""My Home: The American Dream"" contest, sponsored by Coldwell Banker and Scholastic Publishing. In the video, Joseph tells viewers, ""We're showing you can redefine the American dream."" But the Salwens' house has sat on the market for more than a year. It's a tough time to sell any house, let alone one with an asking price of nearly $1.8 million. Real estate agent Sally George said she's shown the house 40 or 50 times, and there have been nibbles but no buyers. See the house's real estate listing . Many people are interested in the house's rich history but often don't know anything about the philanthropic aspects of the family's project. ""I've never handled a house selling for this reason,"" George said. ""I didn't learn about what the family was doing until early this year."" Hannah and Joseph said most of their friends at school don't know about it. ""We didn't do it for the fame or the glory,"" said Joan Salwen. ""This was something Hannah sort of yanked us into."" Even though it was Joan Salwen's idea to sell the house, it has been tough for her to give it up. ""I have to admit,"" she said, ""I loved living in this house. Does that make me an evil person? I hope not because it's a beautiful place."" The family recently moved to a house less than half the size of their mansion four blocks away. While Hannah's friends called her old home the ""wow house,"" this one is more ordinary and that's fine with her. Lately the family has spent a lot of time around the kitchen table talking about an upcoming two-week trip to Ghana. The Salwens will spend six or seven hours a day visiting the villages where their money will be put to work. Kevin Salwen said the new house is great, it's just smaller.

The latest project is aimed at green jobs, offering former gang members and parolees a chance to break ground in alternative energy programs while the issue is being pushed by President Obama and the nation's lawmakers. Homeboy is the brainchild of the Rev. Gregory Boyle, known simply as Father Greg by everyone here. Boyle first started a small program in 1988 to offer alternatives to gang violence in one of Los Angeles' toughest neighborhoods. ""I started burying young kids who were killed in our community,"" he told CNN. ""I buried my first in 1988 and just buried my 165th two months ago. So we as a community started to say, 'We have to do something.' "" Over the last two decades, Homeboy has reached out to the 1,100 gangs in metro LA, helping provide a second chance to those who want it. The organization provides much-needed job training, hires ex-gang members for transitional jobs and helps give other free programs to people who otherwise struggle in the outside world. Boyle said it's a simple philosophy: Offer gang members hope through gainful employment, and they'll want to ""leave behind all of their gang past."" ""This population really can't afford to just go to school. They are not living at home with their parents. They have no one there, really,"" he said. Reyes calls the Catholic priest a saint. ""If there were more people like him, there'd be less people like me,"" he said. In Reyes' case, he missed the births of his daughters -- Valerie, 9, and Vanessa, 7 -- because he was behind bars. ""I feel I wasted my life,"" he said. ""I thought being a father was making babies, but being a father is taking an interest in your kids."" Since his release from prison in May 2008, he has graduated at the top his class in the Homeboy-sponsored solar program. He is now working on a $2.5 million project for Lite Solar to install 1,500 solar panels on an apartment building. As he watched his daughters play on a recent afternoon, he said, ""It feels good knowing you can provide for them."" On Tuesday, Reyes got another reward: He welcomed his first son into the world. His wife, Susana Reyes, said the Homeboy program completely changed her husband. ""Before, it was all about his gang,"" she said. ""Now, I know he loves his daughters."" Albert Ortega, now 34, spent seven years in prison, beginning when he was just 19. He was hired by Homeboy and is now the coordinator of the solar program. ""This program totally changed my life,"" he said. A father of three children, Ortega said he kept making poor choices to make quick money. After his most recent release from prison, he said he approached Boyle to help him clean up his life. ""I was willing to try anything,"" Ortega said. ""I just didn't want to go back to prison, and I didn't want to disappoint my daughters."" That's a sentiment echoed by the car pool trio. ""Seeing everybody I grew up with going to jail. I didn't want to live that life,"" said Cruz. Added Reyes, ""If you want to change your life around, anything is possible.""

75,"(CNN) -- Sharp-witted. Direct. In control. Loyal. Jenny Sanford, here with her husband, was a Wall Street executive before she married Mark Sanford. That's how friends describe Jenny Sanford, the wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who confessed to the nation in a rambling news conference that he was having an affair with a woman in Argentina. Jenny Sanford, unlike so many wives of cheating politicians, was not there facing the cameras, standing beside her husband. A reporter asked the governor if he and his wife of 20 years were separated. ""I'm here, and she's there,"" he replied. As romantic e-mails between her husband and his mistress were published by a local newspaper Thursday, the state's first lady, a former Wall Street executive, stayed far away from reporters. She was at the family's home on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina with her four sons and a few friends. ""Don't you know that is what Jenny Sanford is about? That is what is authentic about Jenny Sanford. She is not going to humiliate herself by standing next to a story,"" said Cyndi Mosteller, a friend of the Sanfords since 1992 and the former first vice chairwoman of the South Carolina GOP. ""She will stand next to Mark emotionally, but she cannot stand in the glare of others,"" Mosteller continued. ""She is out there taking a dignified road, one that is defined by principle, even if her heart might have difficulty following that principle. But her overriding priority is to protect her children."" Jenny Sanford released a lengthy statement late Wednesday making clear she had learned of her husband's infidelity before his recent secret trip to Buenos Aires. His whereabouts were a mystery for six days, leaving his family in the dark and creating a power vacuum and considerable confusion in the Capitol, with aides telling reporters he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. ""When I found out about my husband's infidelity I worked immediately to first seek reconciliation through forgiveness, and then to work diligently to repair our marriage,"" she wrote. ""We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong. I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago. ""This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage. During this short separation it was agreed that Mark would not contact us. I kept this separation quiet out of respect of his public office and reputation, and in hopes of keeping our children from just this type of public exposure."" Mosteller's brother-in-law was with Jenny Sanford on Thursday as the e-mails penned to ""Maria"" became public. The messages from Mark Sanfordcompliment the woman on her ""tan lines"" and ""gentle kisses."" The e-mails were published by The State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina's capital, which said the governor's office confirmed they are authentic. When contacted by CNN, the governor's office would neither confirm nor deny their authenticity. ""[The e-mails] are almost like reading a novel that you would embarrassed to buy,"" Mosteller said. ""To be one of his four children and know that is there for the world to see, it is incredible to all of us."" Jenny Sanford grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and earned a degree in finance from Georgetown University. She met Mark Sanford when they worked for investment firms in New York, she at Lazard Freres and he at Goldman Sachs. The two married and moved to his native South Carolina, and she managed his campaign for Congress in 1994. ""Mark started out with five other opponents, and he didn't really have a shot. That was the opinion of most people,"" Mosteller said. ""But she and Mark worked together and turned that thing around so that candidate three, four and five ended up throwing their support behind him, and he won."" The two are equals intellectually, according to people who know them. She went on to manage his gubernatorial campaign in 2002, turning her home into campaign headquarters. Jenny Sanford was more than a visible first lady of South Carolina; she was involved in the finances of her husband's office to an extent that drew heated criticism from his opponents. She also took a $70,000 deficit from the operations of the governor's mansion and put its finances into the black. ""I pretty much am in his office in the mornings most days, and I do pretty much anything he wants me to do for him. I help to bridge the gap between things that have been commonplace themes in his life and make sure everybody in the office is on pace with his agenda,"" Jenny Sanford told Charleston's Post and Courier in June 2005. The governor told the newspaper that his wife is ""particularly good with financial analysis [and] working with numbers."" She took up health as a key issue in her role as first lady, advocating nutrition, exercise and cancer prevention, serving on major boards and speaking at various functions to raise funds for disease research. ""This is a classy woman who lacks pretension,"" Mosteller said. ""I took a road trip with her last year, and she just automatically got into the back seat. When we were making a lot of appearances, and the schedules were hectic, she called and said, 'I've figured out that the key is changing your deodorant.' ""Jenny is someone you can talk politics with, you can talk about grand issues with, and you can also discuss deodorant,"" Mosteller said. ""She's a remarkable, classy woman with a lot of integrity who is trying to keep it together.""",0.6071347,4914
76,"(CNN) -- Jen Bucala has a lot of faith in her family's ""lucky"" numbers. ""I've been playing, or around playing, the lotto all my life,"" she says. She rattles off her numbers, citing family birthdays, and recounting numerical coincidences. ""Me, my husband, my father-in-law ... all our birthdays are in November. Just a week apart from each other,"" says Bucala, 31. One number that did surprise her was $10,000. After some quick figuring,  Bucala estimates she has spent that amount on scratch off games and Megamillions since she started playing a decade ago. For Bucala, a Lindenhurst, New York, resident who works three jobs -- as a sales associate, an Avon Rep and a bridal consultant -- that is a lot of money. ""That ten grand could have gone toward a million and one bills I have -- my mortgage, car payments,"" Bucala says. ""We spend thousands of dollars every month on bills. I don't have kids either. That [lotto] money could have been a whole month for me for bills,"" she says. But like a lot of people, Bucala thinks $1 is a small price to pay for a dream. ""You gotta play in order to win. That's part of lotto. You never know,"" says Bucala. One of the seductive features of the lotto is the low entry fee says Frank Farley, a psychology professor at Temple University. ""It can be exciting, checking those winning numbers,"" says Farley. ""Maybe something big might happen. There's not a whole lot of other things in your life where you put a small amount of money in and maybe something big will happen. It gives you a sliver of hope that you could turn your life around."" And sometimes there are winners. Mineola Oaks, is retired and living in Washington Heights, New York. She has played lotto every day, spending $3-$5 a day (and more on Tuesday) for over 20 years. (Just $4 a day for 20 years adds up to almost $30,000.)  Two years ago she won $100,000. And with that money she paid off her bills and did some remodeling on her second home in Virginia. Oaks still buys lotto tickets, but she cautions that there's always something else you can put the money towards. ""I take care of things first,"" she says. ""Food, rent -- Then you can go out and spend a dollar on the lotto."" Just don't expect to win. Let's take Powerball for example. Your chances of winning the jackpot is one in 195,249,054 says Michael Orkin, a statistician and dean of business, math and science at Laney College in Oakland, California. Let's say you buy 50 Powerball tickets a week, you'll win the jackpot about once every 75,000 years, he says. Cold, hard numbers aside, the lotto is entertainment. ""Almost everyone spends money on entertainment,"" says Stephen Brobeck of the Consumer Federation of America. ""People spend hundreds of dollars going to a sports event. Others spend a thousand dollars a year on premium cable channels. Purchasing a lotto ticket -- it's excitement and there's always the possibility, however slim, that they will strike it rich and win,"" he says. Cost of fleeting excitement adds up . Sodanys Paulino, 21, of Washington Heights, stood outside a lottery terminal one rainy Friday night. She bought two scratch off tickets and a mega millions ticket. When asked what else she could be doing with that money, she laughs. ""Two dollars? You can't buy anything for two dollars,"" she says. But $2 a week is about $100 a year. And $100 can buy you something. The problem is opportunity costs, says Farley. ""What opportunities are lost because you are putting discretionary income into the lottery when you could be putting it into something else?"" he asks. ""A small amount of money can be spent on dental floss,"" he says. The lotto sends the wrong message, says Farley. ""It's hard work versus chance. The lotto says success can be built on chance."" A 2005 study by the Consumer Federation of America says 38 percent of people with incomes below $25,000 think that winning the lottery represents the most practical way for them to accumulate several hundred thousand dollars. ""Lower income people think their chances of winning are slim. And they think that the probability [for them to win] is greater than being able to accumulate savings over time. The lotto advantage . Peter Tufano, a Professor at Harvard Business School, harnessed this idea that people would rather have a small probability of a large payout when he came up with the ""Save to Win"" idea. It's part savings, part raffle ticket. And it's had major success in Detroit, Michigan, where eight credit unions have been offering it since January. Here's how it works. You open up a one-year certificate of deposit and for every $25 you save, you get the chance to win a $100,000 prize. Hank Hubbard, the director of Communicating Arts Credit Union in Detroit, Michigan, says when his credit union offered a 10 percent interest rate on a one-year CD, no one signed on, but with Save to Win, 14 percent of their membership signed up. ""I am surprised at the extent of the success. We really are showing people that they can afford to save,"" he says. And in the very worst case even though someone may not win the grand prize, at least they've already accumulated some savings. But when it comes to playing the real thing -- old habits die hard. ""I'm still going to buy my scratchoffs,"" says Bucala. ""I'm not going to go cold turkey,"" she says. ""No way! It's too exciting ... knowing you have the chance to win.""",0.60617584,8212
77,"Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, All Platform Journalist John Couwels reports from Orlando, Florida. Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has announced that it will lay off employees. ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Orlando: What first comes to mind? Walt Disney World or Universal resorts, perhaps? The two parks are the nation's biggest tourist draws. As a new resident of Orlando, I find that the tourist areas are more removed from the city than I thought. Still, some people in the area where I currently live either work or have business dealings at tourist attractions. As with every city in the United States, Orlando is dealing with the fallout of an economic slowdown. Tourism officials expect an 8 percent to 10 percent drop in tourism dollars for 2009. Nonetheless, during a recent visit to Disney's Magic Kingdom with my family, I experienced a packed park. My first visit in 10 years: The park did not seem any different except for the $129 I paid for a six-month Florida resident pass. Disney World recently announced a major loss in income and that layoffs are expected. Sources within Disney say the layoffs could begin this week. Disney will not say how many people will be eliminated while it restructures and consolidates operations. I have not heard panic among businesses and city officials over the Disney announcement, despite the fact Disney World says it is the biggest single-site employer in the United States with 62,000. Disney spokesman Mike Griffin said: ""We are bigger than the Pentagon."" Disney told me cuts would be significant, affecting back office workers. Griffin said guests visiting the parks would not see any difference. Danielle Courtney, spokeswoman of the Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau, said she was sure that ""Disney will provide a value experience for their guests."" But she said Disney is doing what every other business is doing: cutting costs. Orlando's economic and development director, Bill Billingsley, said the city has not lost a significant amount of jobs. Billingsley is concerned about the Disney layoffs but optimistic on the limited effect on the city's economic health. From the big corporations to the funky little tea and sandwich shop east of downtown, businesses are feeling the pinch. The owner of Pom Pom's Teahouse and Sandwicheria was telling my friend how she had to cut everyone's hours to part time to save on expenses. The store has been open since 2006. Owner Pom Moongauklang, a trained pastry chef, told me she's doing whatever it takes to stay open. Pom cut her four employees' hours instead of their jobs, lowered prices and extended hours to 24 hours on the weekends. Pom said of the 60- to 70-hour work week: ""It's killing me, but it's working."" Along the epicenter of tourist hotels, restaurants and T-shirt shops, International Drive business owners say they are hurting. Aby Aly, owner of a gift shop selling goods from T-shirts to plush dolls, said that ""business is off by 35 percent, and people are not buying."" As I drive around town, I do not see a large number of closed-down stores. Like other cities, Orlando has seen big national chain closures like Linen-N-Things and Circuit City. Yet at two of the area's outlet malls, you would never know there is an economic crisis. I waited 10 minutes in line to enter the parking lot. In the suburbs where foreclosures are their highest, more businesses have closed their doors. As I looked for a house to rent I was surprised how a one-bedroom condo in downtown was the same price as a four-bedroom house only five miles away. Real estate agent Sue Bee Laginess said the city has a glut of homes and condominiums for sale or rent. She said her office has seen business double from four months ago because of the low prices. The agent said owners have either lowered prices, been foreclosed on or are selling the house for the amount owed to the bank. For one store in my new quaint neighborhood of College Park, business has never been better: Top Drawer Consignments. Fred Rodgers, a former Disney designer and one of the store's owners, said ""the tough economy is helping us."" Shoppers say they save money buying used furniture. Yet College Park has not been immune from the economic crisis; real estate offices and gift shops have closed there, too. Despite the downturn, Orlando officials believe their city has fared better than most. Orlando's economic development director told me Orlando is building a medical city that will add 10,000 jobs in the coming years. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer will give his State of Orlando speech Wednesday, the same week the area's biggest employer could begin layoffs.",0.60327196,2549
78,"(CNN) -- ""The Blind Side"" could have been filmed anywhere, says Tim Bourne, an independent producer who worked on the film. But there's a reason producers brought the project to Georgia: money. ""There's nothing in [the movie] that couldn't have been shot in any midrange urban setting. The reason, and the sole reason, it was shot in Georgia was the tax incentives,"" he said. Georgia boasts one of the highest tax credits in the United States: a 20 percent base tax credit, with an additional 10 percent if a Georgia logo appears somewhere in the project. The Oscar-nominated ""Blind Side"" is one of many films that's taken advantage of the incentives to shoot in the Empire State of the South, incentives that also include a diverse set of locations, state-of-the-art facilities and large production crews. Recently, another production, ""Hall Pass,"" written by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (""There's Something About Mary""), started filming in the Atlanta area. The film, starring Owen Wilson and Jenna Fischer, is about a woman who gives her husband permission to have an affair. It called for a New England location -- standard for the brothers, who are from Rhode Island -- but tax incentives led the production crew south, producers said. Georgia is far from the only state offering filmmakers opportunities to leave Hollywood. Indeed, it's one of 44 states offering incentives in hopes of attracting projects that will help their economies, according to the Tax Foundation. ""No one is trying to compete with L.A. from a technical standpoint,"" Bourne said. ""They're certainly competing from a financial standpoint, though. The name of the game is all about tax incentives. It's the sad truth. ""Films are made in a particular place strictly because of financial rebates,"" he continued. ""If, tomorrow, Louisiana or ... any state with a crew base, rather, came up with a better incentive program, that's where the work would be -- overnight."" Incentives differ from state to state. In most cases, filmmakers are able to apply for a tax credit or rebate as long as they meet the state's minimum standards for expenditures and utilize local crews, some of whom don't belong to unions. However, Bill Thompson, deputy commissioner at the Georgia Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Office, said bigger production companies usually prefer to work with union workers. Louisiana, one of the first states to develop an incentive program eight years ago, has found exposure in front of the camera with films such as ""Ray"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" ""Green Lantern,"" set for release in 2011, is one of many projects whose makers opted to film in Louisiana after the state increased its film production tax credit to 30 percent in 2009, said Chris Stelly, director of the Louisiana Office of Film and TV. But Louisiana doesn't just attract projects because of the state's high tax credit, he said. ""No matter how big your incentive is, if someone doesn't have a good experience, they're not going to be back,"" he said. Warner Bros. Entertainment is what Stelly calls a repeat customer. Michael Walbrecht, vice president of Studio & Production Affairs at Warner Bros., said the company brings a lot of projects to Louisiana. It's the third most popular place the company films, behind Los Angeles and New York. ""So far, we've had great experiences in the [Southeast],"" Walbrecht said. There's no denying the tremendous impact the film industry has had on each state. Hotels, rental cars, restaurants, equipment rentals, local crews, props, wardrobes and local extras are just some of the ways the industry gives back to the area it films in. According to the Web site for Georgia's Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office, TV networks, Hollywood studios, production companies and independent producers invested more than $521 million in Georgia in fiscal year 2008-09; the state estimates the economic impact of this investment at $929 million. Louisiana has experienced economic success, as well. Its Economic Development department's Web site says the incentives have generated thousands of jobs and more than $2 billion since the program began in 2002. ""With some of the bigger movies, [there are] hundreds of extras on set,"" Thompson said. ""Those people all get paid something per day. This is especially a big deal in small towns that have never had a film [shoot] there. To spend a few million dollars in a rural area [makes a big difference]."" Even California, the home of the business, has gotten into the act. The state recently introduced a 20 percent tax credit, though its incentives aren't as broad as in other states. For example, TV shows to air on basic cable qualify for the credit, whereas shows on broadcast networks do not. Walbrecht said the amount of larger movies and TV shows filming in smaller states will continue to rise, which is one reason California was prompted to create incentives. ""They realized their iconic industry was moving elsewhere,"" he said. Meanwhile, away from Hollywood, the competition is getting stiffer. North Carolina became a major player in the filmmaking business thanks to such productions as the TV show ""Dawson's Creek,"" which filmed in the coastal city of Wilmington and helped create a thriving film industry there. So when ""The Last Song"" -- set in Wilmington -- began filming in seaside Savannah, Georgia, hard feelings were inevitable. ""You can't dwell on what you lost; you have to keep going and move forward,"" said Aaron Syrett, director of the North Carolina Film Office. ""It happens all the time, to every state."" Legislation to raise the 15 percent tax credit was proposed before ""The Last Song"" chose not to film in North Carolina. The state's new refund, 25 percent, went into effect January 1. ""We're not trying to [have] the highest refund. We're trying to be the smartest,"" Syrett said. In other words, offer a hefty tax rebate -- and roll camera.",0.6015946,8937
79,"LONG ISLAND, New York (CNN)  -- The death of a temporary Wal-Mart worker trampled by customers amid frantic Black Friday shopping could have been avoided, the union that represents retail workers said Saturday. Customers rushing to get into a Valley Stream, New York, Wal-Mart damaged doors and trampled a worker. Jdimytai Damour, 34, was crushed as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a Long Island, New York, store at 5 a.m. Friday, police said. ""This incident was avoidable,"" said Bruce Both, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500, the state of New York's largest grocery worker's union. ""Where were the safety barriers? Where was security? How did store management not see dangerous numbers of customers barreling down on the store in such an unsafe manner? ""This is not just tragic; it rises to a level of blatant irresponsibility by Wal-Mart,"" he said.  Watch father of trampled worker react » . Wal-Mart spokesman Dave Tovar said Saturday that the company had no response to the union's comments, referring CNN to a written statement the retailer released Friday. The statement said the store added internal security, brought in outside security, erected barricades and worked with Nassau County police in anticipation of heavy crowds. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the deceased,"" Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Hank Mullany said in the statement. ""We are continuing to work closely with local law enforcement, and we are reaching out to those involved."" Damour's death was one of two high-profile violent incidents on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving and traditionally one of the year's busiest shopping days. Police say two men shot each other dead in a Toys ""R"" Us in Palm Desert, California, after they argued in the store. The fight did not appear to be related to shopping, according to authorities. At the Wal-Mart, police say that a line began forming at 9 p.m. Thursday and that, by 5 a.m. Friday, there were as many as 2,000 customers outside. A video showed about a dozen people knocked to the ground as the doors were opened and the crowd surged, breaking the doors. Minutes later, police trying to give Damour first aid were jostled by customers still running into the store, authorities said. The union is calling for an investigation ""by all levels of government"" to ensure justice for Damour's family and make sure that such an incident never happens at Wal-Mart again.  Watch reaction to the incident » . ""If the safety of their customers and workers was a top priority, then this never would have happened,"" said Patrick Purcell, a projects director for the local UFCW. ""Wal-Mart must step up to the plate and ensure that all those injured, as well as the family of the deceased, be financially compensated for their injuries and their losses. Their words are weak."" The UFCW has long been a harsh critic of Wal-Mart's, arguing that the world's largest retailer offers low wages and poor health care for its workers and pushes competitors and suppliers to do the same or go out of business. The group has had only marginal success in organizing Wal-Mart workers in the United States and Canada, citing aggressive anti-union efforts by Wal-Mart. The UFCW has 1.3 million members working largely in the retail, food and food-processing industries. CNN's Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.",0.60080135,1308
80,"(CNN) -- When an overwhelmed Shreve Stockton tweeted: ""I need an assistant!"" she considered it more of a joke than a serious request, because she couldn't pay a salary. ""I can't even offer room & board, only a camp trailer named the Psychedelic Jellybean & an unlimited supply of milk!"" she tweeted last month. Shreve is not a celebrity or executive requiring a personal assistant, but a published writer and photographer who lives in a log cabin on 40 acres in the rolling hills near Ten Sleep, Wyoming. Her homestead includes a dog, tomcat, dairy cow, baby calf, young bull she's training to work like an ox, two horses and, of course, Charlie the coyote. She feels overwhelmed with the daily care of all the animals. But she'd also like to share her home with visiting assistants because ""it's becoming so rare in America to have the time and space and the openness of the rural landscape that is shrinking."" The only ""luxury"" she will be able to provide a starving artist is the time ""to work on whatever they want art-wise"" in their off time, without having the stress of coming up with money for rent or utilities. Her ad was only posted for a day or two but drew around  100 responses -- with one person offering to pay her for the opportunity to be her assistant. She directed them to an application. She shared a few of the forms with her boyfriend, Mike, a trapper with the Bureau of Land Management, who found all the applicants interesting and told her if he had to choose, he'd have to move into a tent so they could all move into his house. The application also came with an unusual warning to all would-be helpers that there would be no petting, no face-to-face time and no ""hanging out"" with Charlie. The wild-born Charlie earns his keep by allowing Shreve to take photos of his everyday activities and write about him in her book as well as on her blog -- both titled the Daily Coyote. She's raised him since he was 10 days old, after his parents were shot for attacking sheep. Although he walks on a leash, co-exists with Eli the cat, plays with Chloe the dog and often visits inside Shreve's house, Charlie does not like strangers. So for everyone's safety, her new helper will not be visiting inside the electric fence that surrounds his territory. But that's OK with self-taught artist Sarah Frary of Kentucky, who plans to move into the trailer and spend part of her days helping Shreve with household tasks such as cleaning milk pails and maintaining her Web site, and the rest of her time on her art. Frary, 23,  expects the experience will have a ""monumental"" effect on her drawing, painting and screen printing. She describes her current drawings as ""very primordial and ancient feeling,"" while her new boss calls them fantastic. Frary has already started blogging about her new life and plans to set off later this month. She sought out the position because Shreve's ""energy and everything about her just completely resonates and it's something I connect with."" Shreve was a little concerned about sharing her space with a stranger, but said she felt ""a kindredness"" with the young woman, who has been working as an apprentice tattoo artist in Louisville, Kentucky. Frary also performs ""live art,"" which she describes as taking place in a theater during a concert or play with her perched near the edge of the stage, painting on a large scale that has her ""throwing paint and finger painting -- getting crazy with it."" The work-exchange program will give Shreve more time to ""concentrate on her next artistic endeavor."" She has a few ideas percolating and hopes to decide on one ""the day after my new help arrives."" Frary, a tattooed former military brat, feels her arrival won't go unnoticed, with her PT Cruiser covered in stickers she describes as bizarre and with an interior sporting a bobble-head Mr. T and feathers. Shreve landed in Wyoming after her own unusual journey, a solo, cross-country trip from California to New York on a motor scooter. After reaching her destination, she returned to the shadow of the Big Horn mountains to write about the trip on her Vespa Vagabond blog. While she fell in love with Wyoming instantly, the author says it still felt like another planet at first and it was a year and a half before she ""fully got into the rhythm of this life."" Because Frary's father was in the Air Force, she says she's used to having to uproot and adapt to new places. She also describes herself as being outdoorsy, pretty adventurous and a nature person who loves to challenge herself. The two women will have to work out their schedules and computer differences: the Wyoming resident only knows Macs, while the visitor has built her own PC. Shreve plans to teach Frary how to market her art on the Internet and is willing to teach her how to mend real fences and care for the animals. The older woman picked up her skills watching and helping her neighbors. ""I'm a pretty gung ho, hardworking person, so I'll probably get my hands on everything,"" says the painter, who expects a full, disciplined life in the country with fewer distractions than the city. But there is one service Frary says she probably won't be able to provide to Shreve's satisfaction: cooking. She says her mother hated cooking so she never learned. She has been taking lessons from a vegan friend who doesn't use any animal products. Cooking takes a lot more planning on the homestead because the nearest grocery store is about an hour away.",0.5981851,9834
81,"(CNN) -- New details have emerged about a Jewish immigrant who fled Austria as World War II was brewing, lived frugally in New York and left an estate whose size -- $300,000 -- astounded some. Ida Blumin fled Austria in 1938 for the U.S. and married Walter Fischer, who earned money performing odd jobs. In a story published Monday, CNN and other news organizations reported neither the woman's name nor much else about her, except for the fact that she had donated half of her estate to Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a school with which she had had no known contact. Since then, CNN has contacted two of her friends and a relative, who have identified her as Ida Fischer, who was born Ida Blumin in 1911 in Vienna. They said she was neither a concentration camp survivor nor had she ever been homeless, as the school originally reported. Her life story, however, was still remarkable. In 1938, she, her mother, her sister and her sister's husband fled Austria, said Peter Last, a Jewish collectible coin and banknote wholesaler who lived on East 32nd Street and befriended Fischer 20 years ago, when she lived a block away. The Blumins made their home in New York, where they had relatives. The 5-foot-2-inch immigrant married Walter Fischer, another Austrian, who earned money performing odd jobs. The couple lived with Fischer's mother; Ida Fischer earned money from a variety of office jobs. Fischer, who was in her mid-70s when Last met her in the late 1980s, gave the impression that she was just scraping by, he said. ""She hung around on the street and talked to everybody and people gave her food and clothes,"" he said. ""She was very thrifty."" She once traveled with her mother to Israel, but did not appear particularly religious, Last said. Gabor Szanto, who met Fischer nearly 40 years ago upon his arrival in the United States from Hungary by way of Italy, disagreed, saying his friend observed all the high holidays. ""I used to take her to the synagogue,"" said the hair colorist who has a shop on the Upper West Side and cut Fischer's hair for free. He received 25 percent of her estate. ""She was a great believer in God."" He described her as ""a free spirit."" ""She would say she liked weak men and strong coffee,"" he said. ""She was always being taken out to eat by one person or another; people bought her things, bought her food, bought her newspapers. But she wasn't a down-and-out bag lady with a pushcart like the people in the movie. She was very neat, clean and she was a decent person."" He said her penny pinching was understandable ""because she lived through the Depression."" Last said that, throughout the years he knew Fischer, she lived on East 31st Street in a 10th-floor, sparsely furnished one-bedroom apartment in a building for senior citizens. Her rent -- about $145 per month -- was even lower than it would have been because she reported housing code violations in her apartment to authorities, who then declined to approve rent hikes, Last said. But Fischer spent much of her time outside the building, where she sat on a bench dressed in old clothes and carried on a busy social life. ""Everyone knew her,"" he said. ""Everybody in the diner on the corner knew her."" Among her coterie was Rue McClanahan, who played Blanche Devereaux on ""The Golden Girls"" and lived on the block, he said. Neighbors would sometimes give her items they no longer wanted. Fischer's frugality was legend: She recycled greeting cards, crossing off the name of the original recipient and replacing it with the new one. ""She'd write on the top of it: 'From Ida,'"" Last said. Instead of paying extra to get an unlisted telephone number, she simply listed it under someone else's name, he said. Occasionally, Last, now 74, would treat his neighbor to a meal at the diner or a nearby delicatessen, where her favorite dishes included lox. Though she was not thin, she would rarely finish what was on her plate. ""A lot of it, she would take home,"" he said. ""She'd take all the sugar and all the napkins; she'd bring extra jars to take coffee home in."" He always picked up the tab. ""There was never any question,"" he said. ""I don't think she ever bought anything."" Last, who was also born in Austria, helped Fischer increase her monthly pension from the Austrian government. He also helped her augment her income, giving Fischer $5 to sit in his Peugeot on days when the street sweeper went by so that he would not get a parking ticket. One day, Fischer asked Last about a flier she had received offering to help residents write their will for free. ""I looked into it and I found that this was the Brooklyn Law School; they would send a lawyer who would take two students to people's houses and do their wills, so I said, 'It's OK.'"" Fischer asked Last to serve as executor and he agreed. She also told him that she would leave him money, but Last was unimpressed. ""I never thought she had any real money,"" he said. ""She was enough of a pest that I told her, 'No, I don't want it.'"" She took him at his word. Instead, she left a quarter of her $300,000 estate to Last's wife, Silvia, a quarter to Szanto and half to Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where a spokesman said the school was grateful for the donation, but had no idea what inspired it. Though Fischer remained alert until the end, she faltered physically during her final months, when she ""very reluctantly"" hired a woman to take care of her. ""She didn't want to pay for it,"" Last said. Fischer died in 2007 of heart failure, he said. Last said Fischer had told him she had no relatives, but he discovered after her death that she had not been truthful. ""It turned out there was a sister and a nephew that she wasn't on speaking terms with,"" he said. Even after Fischer died, Last continued to learn about his friend's penurious ways. When he went to a bank to carry out his duties as executor of the will, a vice president told him Fischer had taken advantage years before of a promotional offer of a year's free access to a safe deposit box, Last said. But after the year elapsed, she refused to pay the $100 annual fee, he said. So the banker told him he kept Fischer's Series E savings bonds for $60,000 in his desk drawer, Last said. Though the size of her total savings surprised him, Last said her dogged thrift could have explained it. He calculated that -- between her pension from Austria and her $800 monthly check from Social Security -- her monthly income was about $2,000, of which she spent only about $500. Fischer's sister -- from whom she had long been estranged -- died a few months ago, said Fischer's nephew, Peter Lynwander, who lives in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He said he last saw his aunt more than three decades ago at a family get-together. ""She was a live wire,"" quick to pound out a waltz on the piano or to dance. He was not surprised at the sum of her savings: ""She worked all her life and she didn't live high. So I don't think that's all that unusual."" CNN's story published Monday quoted a spokesman for the school as saying Fischer had survived a concentration camp and lived homeless on the streets of New York. Her friends and her nephew said neither was true. On Friday, school spokesman Richard Dukas said the discrepancies were the result of a miscommunication. Hebrew University ""regrets misinterpreting the facts about Ida's amazing and generous story,"" he said. ""What is clear is that Ida was a remarkable woman who has made a difference by supporting research and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, something that will have an impact far beyond the borders of the state of Israel.""",0.596857,5656
82,"(CNN) -- When the water of Lake Delton ripped through the highway and drained into the Wisconsin River this week, so did the lifeline for much of the surrounding community. Boats sit mired in mud Tuesday after Lake Delton drained into the Wisconsin River the day before. Lake Delton Village and Wisconsin Dells, the self-professed ""waterpark capital of the world,"" are home to about 5,000 residents. But the area's motels, resorts and vacation homes can accommodate more than 10 times that, according to the visitors bureau. Innkeepers, restaurateurs and other business owners were getting ready for the typically bustling tourist season this week when torrential rains sent the 267-acre lake rushing through an embankment propping up Highway A. The manmade lake sucked a 200-foot swath of highway and a half-dozen homes into the Wisconsin with it. ""I was on the water when I realized the plug had been pulled,"" said Steve Zowin, who was towing a capsized pontoon boat when he noticed the water level quickly diminishing. ""It drained like a bathtub.""  Watch a report from the lake » . Zowin and his wife, Kathy, have owned Lake Delton Watersports for almost three decades. In addition to running a marina, the couple offers parasail rides and rents boats. Personal watercraft and ski boats are their most popular wares, he said. ""My gross income will be reduced by about 75 percent, and that's huge,"" he said Wednesday. ""It's a big step backwards for someone who's been in business for 29 years."" Zowin, 56, says that most of the tourists hail from metropolises like Chicago, Illinois; St. Paul/Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- all ""within a gas tank of the Dells."" They start trickling in on Father's Day, and tourism booms between Independence Day and mid-August, he said. Like many business owners around Lake Delton, Zowin is seeing canceled reservations from disenchanted visitors who will be spending their summers elsewhere. Asked whether visitors were canceling reservations at her lakeside resort, one owner who didn't want to give her name replied, ""Every day, many."" Thomas Brown, who owns Port Vista, a popular burger and steak joint on the lake, said that one of his resort-owner friends has refunded $10,000 in deposits for canceled reservations. The friend has closed his resort until at least July, Brown said. iReport.com: Are you near the floods? Send photos, video . Brown, 49, who has owned the bar and restaurant for 15 years, said business hasn't been hit hard yet. ""The first couple of days has been absolutely packed because of all the people coming by to look at the lake and stopping by for a burger or steak,"" he said, adding that he doesn't expect business to boom for long. ""I think when people see what they have to see, it's going to be not so good."" Some business owners who aren't on the lakefront are still trying to gauge what effect the drained lake will have on them.  Watch the rushing lake carry a home away » . Del-Bar is a popular seafood and steak restaurant near the lake on Wisconsin Dells Parkway. It's so popular, in fact, that actor Johnny Depp and director Michael Mann recently stopped in during filming of their upcoming movie ""Public Enemies,"" owner Jeff Wimmer said. Wimmer said his restaurant, which he has owned for 30 years, may be more resilient than lakefront businesses because he relies more on Wisconsin Dells locals. The 66-year-old knows that the summer brings hungry tourists; it's just too early to tell how many of them have been deterred by the dry lake bed. ""We're anticipating that it's going to affect us, but it's too early to tell right now,"" Wimmer said. How long the lake will remain dry is also a question. Business owners say, some skeptically, that there are efforts afoot to refill the lake by mid-July. Delton Oaks Resort ran a warning on its Web site to potential guests, explaining that there was no timetable for refilling the lake and repairing the highway. But the resort's owners showed they still have a sense of humor. ""We at Delton Oaks Resort are 'make lemonade' kind of people, so we will be adding terrific beach volleyball and horseshoe courts in the near future. And, of course, building sand castles on the beach will be big this year,"" the site quipped. ""For all you dog lovers, as soon as the last of the lake bed has dried up, we will have the biggest dog park you've ever seen."" Even if the lake is refilled quickly, business owners like Zowin and Brown fear that the lake's splendid fishing might not make a rapid rebound. The lake was home to white and largemouth bass, walleye, crappie, bluegill and perch, but those fish are now in the Wisconsin River after their habitat burst through the Highway A embankment. ""Fishing might be gone for the next four or five years,"" Brown predicted. Business owners around Lake Delton say they hope to bounce back sooner, perhaps by next summer, but this summer may be a wash. ""Once in a while, the more serious ramifications -- mostly financial -- they hit me, and I'm flooded with a few emotions,"" Zowin said. ""It's going to hurt, but I'll survive.""",0.5957179,3983
83,"ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN)  -- Lisa Brown was caught off-guard by the offers of help that came from strangers. Lisa Brown has to move out of her rental house because it fell into foreclosure and was sold at auction. ""I'm overwhelmed,"" she said. ""People helping people in these tough times. I never meant to solicit any help. This is incredible, really."" Brown and her three daughters can't escape eviction. The family is being kicked out of a rental house because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the home fell into foreclosure. The house was sold at auction, and they have to move out by May 1. She didn't seek financial help, but it came anyway. An executive from Texas named Kelvin who saw Brown's story on CNN.com was moved by her ""unfortunate situation"" and wanted to help. He sent a check for $400. A New York man named Dave offered financial help as well as aid planning for the future. When Brown moved into the Long Island, New York, home last summer, she loved the spaciousness she never had in an apartment. ""It was bigger than what I had lived in,"" she said. Brown was also won over by the neighborhood, with its tidy homes and good schools. ""I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district."" The bad news came just seven months after she moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had to vacate. ""I was hysterical. I was like, 'What do you mean?' ""  Watch Lisa Brown talk about why she has to move » . The broker explained that the landlord no longer owned the property and the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure. As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the mortgage was being paid. ""I didn't see there was a problem,"" she said. ""You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage."" Brown was astonished to learn that her landlord, who lives upstairs, rented the house when she knew that she was losing it. ""She knew that this house was foreclosing on her. She did nothing about it,"" Brown said. ""Nothing except take my money."" Brown had been paying $1,900 a month in rent. She had also paid $5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house. That money, she said, is gone. ""She will not give me my deposit back. Nothing."" CNN tried to reach the owner for comment about the security fee, but no one answered the door, and the phone is disconnected. The broker who rented Brown the house and who was paid $1,900 said he didn't know that the house was in foreclosure. He also said the brokerage fee will not be returned. Dave, who lives on Long Island and who also read Brown's story on CNN.com, was perplexed that none of the fees were being refunded. To help recoup her losses, Dave offered help and sent a check for $5,000. Helping with Brown's immediate needs was not enough for Dave, a financial adviser who wanted to do something for her future. ""He offered me a retirement plan,"" Brown said. ""He came to my job, gave me his business card and said, 'I want you to get into this plan; I will help you with this.' "" Dave met Brown over coffee and set her up with a retirement account, something the 42-year-old said she has never had. He will make monthly contributions of $500 for 10 consecutive months to get her started. But Brown still has one problem: She has to move out. She has no legal right to stay. The bank that foreclosed on the house and owns it has offered her $1,000 to vacate. Brown's problem is not unique. Nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal, according to the Center for Housing Policy, a nonprofit organization that researches housing issues. In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what is going on, renters are usually kept in the dark. New York state Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. ""In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,"" he said. Klein said that 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York involve rental properties, and he is working on a law to warn tenants of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time, to keep them from losing their security deposits and being evicted with nowhere to go. Similar laws are in place in California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Rhode Island. ""What we're facing here,"" Klein said, ""it's sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it."" His legislation is scheduled for a vote next week. Responding to the outpouring of help Brown has received, Klein said, ""It's great support for the Brown family, but that's why we need legislation for innocent, hardworking people like Lisa to protect them from reaching the point of desperation. People who play by the rules should not be penalized for the misdeeds and malice of others."" Brown hopes to relocate in the same area so her daughters can stay in the schools they love and be near their friends. A caseworker for the Children's Aid Society, which administers the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund for the victims of the subprime mortgage crisis, saw Brown's story on CNN's ""American Morning."" They are now in contact so the fund can help cover moving and transitional expenses. Brown may have to adjust some of her dreams, but she is optimistic. She said the one thing she has seen through this experience is ""the goodness of the human spirit is alive, and that's encouraging.""",0.5955856,3079
84,"(CareerBuilder.com) -- 2009 has given employers and employees a run for their money -- literally. Budgets have been cut, layoffs made and furloughs instituted, and benefits and perks have evaporated. At the beginning of the year, 38 percent of employers said the economy would force them to make administrative cuts sometime during 2009, according to a survey by CareerBuilder.com. Sixty-five percent of those employers indicated that they would cut back company social events, 61 percent anticipated curtailing business travel, 25 percent expected to scale back on health-care benefits and 11 percent planned to reduce wellness benefits. Other areas where companies planned to cut spending included special office perks, such as coffee, ice machines or discounted vending (34 percent), incentive trips (28 percent) and philanthropic activities (21 percent). Such perks and benefits being taken away make for a tough situation for employees. Not only are they working harder to keep their jobs, but workers have to do more for less. While some argue that it's hard to keep employees motivated in this situation, others say that they shouldn't focus on incentives, but rather think about the bigger picture. ""When perks and benefits are taken away, management often does this to allocate resources where they're needed, elsewhere. The money being saved by not buying bagels every Friday or purchasing Christmas gifts for employees may be going towards your salary,"" said Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a staffing and recruiting firm. ""If you had to choose between taking a salary cut and not having free coffee versus being let go, most employees would likely take the former."" Urmil ""Tracy"" Marshall, coordinator for the Office of Diversity and International Affairs at Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, Georgia., agrees that it's important not to focus on what is being taken away. She said that due to budgetary constraints, furloughs were implemented at the school; but rather than get discouraged, she focused on the positive. ""I reminded myself how blessed I was to even have a job,"" Marshall said. ""We need to remind ourselves of our priorities in life, placing a greater emphasis on what we have -- not what we don't."" Communication is key . Although it's understandable for employees to be upset, frustrated and discouraged when benefits or perks are taken away, Kevin Sheridan, founder and CEO of HR Solutions, which specializes in helping organizations to keep employees engaged, said that employees are less likely to be upset if management communicates with employees. In fact, 82 percent of employees surveyed in HR Solutions' International Normative Database say that it's important that their organization allow them to choose from a variety of benefits to meet their individual needs. The survey consisted of more than 3.3 million responses from 2,400 organizations. ""If an organization's leadership team simply decided amongst themselves which benefits would be best to cut, employees will commonly become upset and their engagement will be negatively affected,"" Sheridan says. ""Open communication is a key driver of engagement, and employees will immediately recognize the fact that they had no voice in the situation. If leadership had simply asked employees which benefits were important to them, this situation may be avoided."" Attitude is everything . Despite having to deal temporarily with a few displaced benefits or perks, there are benefits to sticking around with your employer until those things are reinstated. ""It's a good time to remember that the perks were never the reason that you liked the job. No one gets up in the morning saying, 'I'm really excited to go to the office because there's free coffee,'"" said Paul Glen, author and management columnist. ""If people feel that the [cuts] are being made in a good-faith effort to save jobs, they will be even more loyal than before, since they believe that the company is working on their behalf -- not just for executives."" Additionally, according to the HR Solutions survey, 37 percent of employees have thought of resigning in the last six months. Twenty-three percent said they thought about leaving because of pay; 18 percent because of a supervisor or manager; 15 percent because of career advancement; and 5 percent because of benefits. Thirty-nine percent considered it for other reasons. ""This statistic is especially important because many organizations have cut benefits over the last six months, and it illustrates that the majority of employees have not thought of resigning as a result of adjusted benefits,"" Sheridan said. ""These employees recognize the advantages of sticking around with a company, benefits or not, for advantages such as career development and compensation. Also, as soon as the economy picks up, many benefits programs will be re-evaluated; employees sticking around with these organizations will not remain without benefits forever."" Workers should also remember that there could be consequences to abandoning a job just because you lost free coffee or a transportation reimbursement. If you're thinking about leaving your job for such reasons, make sure that your missing perks outweigh any possible career advancement or opportunities you would receive if you stayed. ""In this economy, it may be very hard to find another job, and there's no guarantee that one will have free coffee, either,"" Glen said. ""Also, at the new job, even if it is good, the employee will have less tenure and is more likely to be cut in future layoffs."" If you've had benefits or perks taken away in recent months and need help staying motivated, remember these five tips from our experts: . 1. Get over it . ""The longer you talk about it to fellow employees, the longer you will have bad feelings, cause others to have bad feelings and be less productive yourself, which is not what will help the company be able to restore what has been taken away,"" said Aubrey Daniels, author of ""Oops! 13 Management Practices That Waste Time and Money (and What to Do Instead)."" 2. Find motivation . Sheridan encourages employees to find motivation through career planning with supervisors, interacting with co-workers or being proud of where they work. For example, an employee could volunteer to act as a sounding board for job candidates considering employment at the organization. 3. Create your own perks . Nancy Irwin, a motivational speaker and author, said employees can take turns bringing in coffee, bagels or potluck lunches to help fill the void of things that have been cut. 4. Understand what's still offered and take advantage . Darcy Eikenberg, president and chief creative officer of Coach Darcy LLC, recalls a client who didn't sign up for a course because she thought training costs had been eliminated. She realized that a co-worker was taking the course and getting it paid for from tuition reimbursement, an area that hadn't been cut. ""Do a deep dive into your company's programs, policies and even discounts because there's probably something you can use now,"" she said. 5. Focus on the solution, not the problem . Concentrate on actions today that will affect your organization's success and growth tomorrow, said Jonathan Berger, director of human resources at Direct Agents, an interactive advertising company. ""Take this time as an opportunity to offer new ideas to your managers and take an active and entrepreneurial role in helping your company overcome straining times. If you do a good job, you may be rewarded for your efforts when things improve,"" he said. ""In addition, by taking on new challenges and opportunities, you can further develop your skills and make yourself a more valuable asset to any organization."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2009.

85,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For actress Jane Alexander, the criticism of a $50 million boost in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts is a sequel. Tony-award winning actress Jane Alexander says giving money to the arts will save and create jobs. She was chairman of the agency from 1993 through 1997 when arts funding was cut sharply by the Republican-led Congress, which questioned whether it was an appropriate way to use government money. Now the issue is whether giving money to the arts should have been part of the economic stimulus program. Among those who have criticized the new spending this year is Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who delivered the Republican response to President Barack Obama's message to Congress Tuesday. On Monday's ""Larry King Live,"" Jindal said, ""Fundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs."" It's no surprise that Alexander disagrees and argues that arts spending can give a vital boost to the economy. The actress, who will appear later this month in a new comedy at the New York theater company Primary Stages called ""Chasing Manet,"" won a Tony Award for her role in the ""The Great White Hope."" She has been nominated eight times for an Emmy and four times for an Oscar for films including, ""All the President's Men"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer."" Alexander spoke to CNN.com last week. CNN: What do you think of the controversy over the $50 million in increased government spending for the arts? Alexander: I think it's long overdue and I was very, very happy to see it. Since 1995-96 we had an incredibly decreased budget for the NEA. Finally we're getting back to where it was when I came in [as chairman]. It's all vitally needed. In fact, the endowment has not kept pace with inflation as other agencies have. ... This $50 million will certainly help a great deal. What people forget is that there are over 2 million people in the United States of America who are professional artists. Those are jobs like any other jobs. The artists have families, they have people for whom they're responsible and they give to their communities. We all have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The life part would be health and housing. The liberty part would be our civil rights. And the pursuit of happiness, the arts would come under that. And it's as vital a part of well-being in the United States as anything else. CNN: When you say 2 million artists, could you define artist? Alexander: Well they include everything from writers, painters, all the visual arts spectrum and that's pretty large, including graphic arts. Theater and so on, music, ceramicists, costume designers, makeup artists, filmmakers, it's a huge panoply. CNN: How far can $50 million go? Alexander: Well for the endowment which has had a budget of around $144 million currently, it can go quite a way. When I came in it was about $175 million and then it was cut under my aegis by Congress down to $99 million. CNN: Some people will say that while the NEA may consider this a victory, it's really a pittance, a drop in the bucket, so little money given the challenges many arts organizations are facing today. Alexander. It will help, it will help enormously, because every single NEA grant that goes out is a challenge to the community to come up with the same amount of money, or a 3 to 1. ... By the way, the public should know that within this coming year, we're going to see an awful lot of arts organizations closing. I just came from working at a theater in Pittsburgh, [Pennsylvania] and the International Poetry Forum, which has been going for 43 years, will close its doors this year. The Milwaukee Shakespeare Festival has already closed. The LA [Los Angeles] Opera has laid off 17 percent of its staff. CNN: So this isn't going to be enough to reverse those kinds of things? Alexander: No, but it will challenge the community to understand what the imperiled status of their arts organizations are. It will only help. It will help an enormous amount, and for some organizations, it will make all the difference in their staying alive. Now the NEA this fall gave out 884 grants, totaling $20 million and that was 38 percent of the project cost of the applicants. So 38 percent is a nice healthy piece of change for the cost of a project. CNN: How did you personally get involved in this cause? Alexander: As an actress who spent most of my career in nonprofit theaters, They began with the seed of an NEA grant back in the late 60s, most of them. Today we have about 450 nonprofit theaters across the United States. Back in 1965, when the NEA was founded, there were only about 23 of them. CNN: Your forthcoming play -- is that being done for a nonprofit theater? Alexander: Yes. It's another nonprofit called Primary Stages in New York City, a small theater. What people don't quite understand about theaters is that they never increase their size. They're bound by the number of seats within a given theater, and meanwhile there's inflation and the costs rise. So currently most theaters can never make more than 50 percent of their income from ticket sales. The rest has to be raised. CNN: How's the company doing? Alexander: It had a good play last year, ""Dividing the Estate,"" by Horton Foote, which got a lot of attention but I don't think it made back its nut on Broadway. It transferred from the nonprofit to a commercial venue on Broadway. ... In the film business, independent films are considered nonprofit in many instances. It's interesting to see that an independent won the Academy Award. Of course it was distributed by a major studio. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" started off as an independent. It did extraordinarily well. ... Many of the commercial arts are fed by the nonprofit arts. And that's another thing most people don't fully understand. Where do you think the Tom Hanks, the Cate Blanchetts of the world come from? They come from small venues that are independent and are nonprofit usually and then they move into the mainstream. CNN: What's your attitude about the future, under the Obama administration. Do you think there's reason for hope about the arts, or despair? Alexander: I think there's reason for great hope. President Obama has said repeatedly and he's said it for a couple of years now, that he thinks arts education is vital for children of all ages, starting right away. We have the arts in nursery school anyway, but he believes in institutionalizing the arts so it's part of the curriculum for every child in America. ... Everybody in all walks of life know people who are out of work presently or are about to be out of work. And the same is true for artists. I know so many artists -- for example visual artists, the gallery has closed or it's cut back. Theaters that are no longer going to do productions with more than five actors. And so on. So I know a lot of people out of work: costume designers, makeup people. And let's not forget all the ancillary jobs from having an arts organization in your neighborhood. That includes restaurants, taxicabs, whatever. CNN: Gov. Jindal said he didn't think the arts money should be part of the economic stimulus plan. Alexander: Well what he doesn't understand is that $50 million goes directly ... as a grant to organizations which employ people. It's quick and it's a system that works beautifully and it's done within a year.",0.5927284,4292
86,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (CNN) -- Richard Barboza sits behind the steering wheel, patiently working a crossword puzzle. There's no rush. Time is one thing Barboza has plenty of. Richard Barboza, left, and John Nilsen are among those struggling in the current economic recession. It's just after sun-up. The streaks of light shimmer off the car windows.

""It's definitely not something that you ever see yourself being, homeless,"" Nilsen says. But homeless they have been for the past six weeks, ever since the money ran out and they were evicted from the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, apartment they shared. Nilsen had lost his job, and Barboza is waiting for disability checks to start arriving. The line of homeless men and women has already started to form at the food bank when the two men walk up. The faces are always the same, with a few more added every day. Michael is a regular. He makes grasshoppers out of palm fronds, then sells them when he can for whatever he can get. James says he once played professional football for the Miami Dolphins. No one believes him. Nilsen and Barboza wait quietly for their turn to get in the front door. ""There's a lot of emotional and mental turmoil when you're in a situation like this,"" Nilsen says. Breakfast at the Cooperative Feeding Program is rushed. There are so many to feed. Seats at the tables are a premium. Nilsen and Barboza eat quickly their meal of sausage patties, an orange wedge, some cake and coffee. They want to get moving. It's back in the car and off to the County Library. They can charge their cell phone there and use the public computers for an hour. Nilsen checks Facebook to see how his friends are doing That's how he stays in touch. The two men then begin searching for places to rent on Florida's West Coast. ""Big old double-wide trailer,"" Nilsen snickers. A two-bedroom catches their eyes. ""I like the location,"" whispers Nilsen, ""It's just north of Tarpon Springs."" If they can get enough money together, Barboza says they'd like to get out of Fort Lauderdale. ""After having spent 20 years here I'm due for a change anyway."" Nilsen agrees. ""We've agreed that we're going to go together, that we're going to stick together. We've been through enough as it is. It's easier to have someone you trust with you when you're in a situation like this."" In the afternoons, the two men try making a few bucks. Nilsen got $25 for participating in a food tasting. Barboza has an opportunity to be in a focus group that will pay him $75. Nilsen had been donating plasma twice a week, but now that he's homeless they can't use him anymore. Barboza made about $20 by panhandling on an Interstate 95 exit ramp for about an hour. He stopped after some other homeless men threatened to kill him for working their turf, he says. It's not easy finding work when your address is a license plate number. For Nilsen and Barboza, it's doubly difficult. Both men have disabilities. Barboza was injured in a car wreck. Nilsen had a blood clot in his right leg when he was 16. He walks with a limp and uses a cane. ""When we pull ourselves out of this,"" Nilsen says, ""it's gonna be something you can look back on and draw from and say, 'You know what, if I was able to get through that ...' "" The long days together living in a car don't allow for much space and not much alone time. ""We're at the point now when I know when not to say anything and he knows not to say anything. And he knows when I'm in a bad mood,"" Nilsen says with a laugh. ""He's got his strengths and weaknesses,"" adds Barboza, ""and I've got mine. We balance each other out."" By the time five o'clock rolls around, the two are getting hungry. There was no lunch today. A nearby church is serving dinner. It's time to stand in another line. They know most of the people here from breakfast at the Cooperative. Many are longtime homeless. ""If they know better than I do how to survive, then let me ask and let me get the knowledge I need to survive for however long it's gonna be,"" Nilsen says. Outside the church a van pulls up The homeless are handed bags of toiletries. You take what you can get because you don't know how long it's gonna be before you get more, Nilsen says. A sliver of a moon shines now. ""The toughest part of the day for us,"" Barboza says, ""is once it gets dark until we go to the place where we sleep at night."" For the next few hours the two men drive the neon sign-lit Fort Lauderdale streets. There are very few places, they say, where they can stop and park without police chasing them off. Once in a while they pull into a local park for a couple hours until the lights on the fields are turned off and the gates closed. At least here, they're not wasting gas. Every night is a challenge making it until 11 p.m., they say, when they can finally drive to their secret spot and bed down in the back of the old SUV.",0.59230334,3358
87,"(CNN) -- The ""best job in the world"" contest has generated huge interest around the globe, but the jury is out on whether that will translate into more tourism dollars for Queensland, Australia. Ben Southall will move into a three-bedroom beach home overlooking the Great Barrier Reef.

""Quite frankly you can have $150 million worth of publicity, but if it doesn't generate sales you've really wasted your time on a pretty story.""

Watch as lucky winner is revealed » . For the winner, Ben Southall, the six-month assignment is a far cry from his old job as a fundraiser. ""I love discovering new places,"" Southall said in his hyperkinetic minute-long application video for the position. ""Last year, I drove all around Africa, I crossed deserts, climbed mountains, run marathons, bungee jump, mountain-bike, scuba-dive and snorkel everywhere because I'm practically a fish myself."" Oh, and he rode an ostrich. He will move into a three-bedroom beach home overlooking the tropical island's Great Barrier Reef. For six months, he will feed the fish, clean the pool and send weekly blog and video reports on what is happening on the island. Other benefits include free return airfares from their nearest capital city, transport on the island, computer and camera gear and travel to other islands. The applicants used various attempts to woo their prospective employer, from wandering round a chilly city center in a bikini, to making their application in the form of a street musical, complete with chorus singers. Sixteen finalists were flown in to Hamilton Island on Monday for interviews with a four-person panel. The job starts July 1. The ""world's best job"" campaign was 18 months in the making as a way to lure more tourism to the 600 islands near the Great Barrier Reef. ""The starting point was how do we get the message out there ... that they're open for business and we want people to come and visit,"" Hayes said. ""The idea of this is to protect jobs throughout our regional parts of Queensland.""",0.5917614,3633
88,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With thousands of Americans looking for jobs, many businesses are saying: Sorry, we're not hiring. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is sending out another message: Come right this way. Donna Gill Lumpkin is one of more than 270,000 people to apply for about 2,950 jobs at the FBI. After years of being outgunned in the battle for job applicants by corporations who could pay bigger salaries, hundreds of thousands of job seekers are applying for FBI positions. The FBI announced a hiring blitz in January to fill more than 2,100 professional staff positions. The job postings run the gamut from scientists to accountants to auto mechanics. In addition, the bureau said it wants to hire 850 FBI agents. What happened next caught many at the FBI by surprise. More than 270,000 people applied over about six weeks. The FBI said about 70,000 people seek positions in a normal year. But this isn't a normal year. Just ask Donna Gill Lumpkin, a divorced mother of two who lives in Maryland. Gill Lumpkin lost her job selling radio ad time in November. ""The competition is really stiff,"" she said. ""There's a lot of people out of work. A lot of people looking for a job."" Gill Lumpkin has applied for a job as an FBI recruiter. If the FBI thinks she has the skills for the post, that's just one step toward a job. She'll have to undergo an FBI background check and take polygraph and drug tests.  Watch the applications pile up at the FBI » . The FBI official in charge of human resources concedes the FBI is benefiting a bit from the sour economy and getting a flood of applications this year. ""In years past it was often difficult to find people with the science and technology background or chemistry background or a biology background because we were competing with the private sector,"" said FBI Assistant Director John Raucci. Raucci said during the dotcom explosion, the FBI had a difficult time competing with dotcom start-up salaries. ""Now, what we offer is stability, we offer a job and I think a very exciting environment in which to work,"" said Raucci. Raucci said the average starting salary at the FBI is about $35,000 per year. But he adds those with extraordinary academic credentials and prior job experience start at a much higher rate. Donna Gill Lumpkin said the stability of a job with the federal government and the good benefits such as health insurance attracted her to apply. ""In this tough economic climate right now the federal government, I think, is one of the most steady and stable places anyone could be."" The stakes are high for Gill Lumpkin, who has a 12-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son. She said her children are covered under her ex-husband's health insurance. But she needs coverage for herself. And she is not able to put any money away right now for her children's college years. ""Right now the college fund is on pause,"" said Gill Lumpkin. ""It's the survival fund. We are trying to survive.""",0.5917017,2362
89,"(CNN) -- A thin girl with caramel skin and a yellow silk blouse walks alone through a barren landscape of rubble. Nway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt's garden. Her legs are marked by cuts. Her face is smeared with white streaks of powder. And her eyes are blank as she sifts through the debris of what used to be her home before Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmar one night and swept her parents away. Her name is Nway, and that's how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village. She refused to talk about the cyclone, pretending it never took place. She became, according to a CNN story, the ""girl who refuses to remember."" A year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing. She found Nway living in a tidy, bamboo house flanked by palm trees. The 8-year-old greeted her visitor with a big smile. Then she asked whether she could play with her visitor's hair. Pam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country. ""After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl,"" said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group. ""She wasn't shy about reaching out to touch my blonde hair."" The night everything changed . Nway's resilience is shared by many in Myanmar, aid workers say. Last year's cyclone was catastrophic. It killed at least 140,000 people and left at least 2 million people without homes, according to the United Nations World Food Programme. The brunt of the storm hit Myanmar's delta region, the country's bread basket. It wiped out crops, shrimp farms and fish ponds. A year later, many fields remain unplanted; supplies are short, and the lack of drinking water complicates recovery efforts, World Food Programme officials say. Yet some sense of normal life is returning, said Mia Marina, a program support manager for World Vision's Nargis response efforts. World Vision is building cyclone-resistant schools and providing supplies to cyclone survivors. ""Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods,"" Marina said. ""Kids are going to school. The markets are open."" The people of Myanmar are also buying planting tools and seed in preparation for the monsoon rains that typically come in May, Sitko said. ""Everyone is hoping that this is the moment that it turns around,"" Sitko said. ""It's an exciting time, a time of hope."" That hope appears to have spread to Nway. She is fortunate to be alive. The cyclone killed her mother and father. The winds were so powerful that they blew away the village buffalo. In Nway's village, 120 people out of a population of 430 people lost their lives. Nway survived because she was staying with her aunt. The pair joined a group squeezed in to the village headman's house to survive, Sitko said. Nway wouldn't talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later. She would walk away whenever she was asked about that night. Now, according to Sitko, who wrote about her meeting for World Vision, Nway can talk a little about her loss. Sitko said Nway shared one memory from the morning after the cyclone while sitting in her aunt's house: . ""When I walked to my aunt's house that day, my legs were scratched, and I passed lots of dead bodies,"" Nway said. ""I wanted to help, because everyone was working, but I was too scared, so I only helped clean up my auntie's yard."" Nway dreams of her future . Nway prefers to talk about other subjects. One is her new job. She helps her aunt sell vegetables from their garden. On most mornings, she smears white powder made from tree bark on her cheeks (it's used as a skin beautifier by women and children in Myanmar). Then she balances a tray of vegetables on her head and walks to a village road to call out to potential customers. Nway told Sitko that she's made ""four new best friends."" They like to memorize new words and play hide and seek after school. ""I'm always the fastest runner,"" she told Sitko. Nway is starting to become aware of life outside her village. ""She was very proud,"" Sitko said. ""She explained that she had recently taken a trip to another village with her aunties, and she wasn't afraid."" Nway doesn't know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said. She'll have to pay to attend school away from her village one day, but her aunt and uncle can't afford the costs. ""She wanted to study and said that she was smart,"" Sitko said. ""She said she would be willing to travel to a school outside of her village if she had to."" Nway has already taken a more difficult journey. The shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said. Now Nway can remember -- and smile again. ""I was expecting a very different girl,"" Sitko said. ""The little girl I met was very confident. I think she's been really transformed by our experience.""",0.591369,4526
90,"(CNN) -- The pastor of a non-denominational church in Argyle, Texas, passed around the collection plate to his congregants earlier this year -- and asked them to take money from it. Donations at the Cross Timbers Community Church had slumped because of the economic downturn. Pastor Toby Slough thought that his congregants had to be hurting, too. His gesture, instead, was met with an unexpected response: The church had its highest offering ever. It was a eureka moment for Slough: Give away money to those who need it, knowing his church members will help fill the need. ""In these economic times, we can't be so into church business that we forget what our business is, and that is to help people,"" Slough told CNN television affiliate KDAF in Dallas-Forth Worth, Texas. In the past two months, the 9-year-old church has done just that: handed out a half-million dollars to members and non-members who are struggling.  Watch pastor on rip off concerns » . ""We've taken $200,000 and spread it out to organizations -- four local, two missions that are feeding and clothing people in these tough times,"" Slough said. ""We've paid utility bills for members of our church that are unemployed or under-employed."" His favorite giveaway came three weeks ago. The church gave 1,400 families $50 each and told them to hand it out to someone else. One of the recipients was Katie Lewis. ""I've been alone so long. Just to be thought of and to be remembered, to be welcomed -- it's amazing,"" she said, crying. Church members are pleasantly surprised. ""You don't hear about a church giving money away,"" Amy Sullivan said. Slough said he is not concerned if people try to take advantage of the church's generosity. ""I told my church a couple weeks ago, if I'm not being taken advantage of, I'm not being like Jesus,"" he said. The church has now formed a group to look into the best ways to give out money. And, Slough said, it plans on doing so as long as there is a need in the community.",0.58937824,6337
91,"(CNN)  -- People who go to Daytona Beach, Florida, by car this weekend will probably wish they hadn't -- they'll definitely stand out in a crowd. Bobby Mitchell, left, and Sheila Justin enjoy Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Florida. The city is being taken over by half a million motorcycle enthusiasts enjoying Bike Week, which began Friday and will end Sunday. The economy may be in a recession, but bikers aren't passing up the chance to soak up some sun and rev up their engines for a few days in Florida for the biggest motorcycle event in the country. ""Every indication we've had so far is that this year's going to be a good one,"" said Kevin Kilian, senior vice president of the Daytona Beach/Halifax Area Chamber of Commerce. The chamber is the managing arm of the city's involvement in Bike Week, a 10-day event that Kilian said takes an entire year to prepare for. Events like Bike Week and its little brother, Biketoberfest, are what keep Daytona Beach running, Kilian said. With 8.5 million visitors each year, special events bring in about $1.3 billion. The two biker events alone generate $650 million of that, he said. The festival didn't always pack in a half-million people, though. In 1988, said Paul Crow, the Daytona Beach police chief at the time, the event had morphed into something very different from what it was when it started. He said he had to battle what he called ""the 1 percent problem"" -- the small group of gangs whose viciousness and threats against outsiders had allowed them to take over Bike Week. He decided he wouldn't have any more of their troublemaking, Crow said, so he created a task force that evolved into the office of special investigations for the Daytona Beach Police. Its specific purpose was to deal with the problem. Today, Bike Week has been restored as family-friendly event. The event has even drawn in other nearby Central Florida communities -- including Ormond Beach in the north and Port Orange and New Smyrna in the south -- giving bikers more events to attend and places to go. Bike Week caters to a wide demographic of people. ""These are people with a lot of disposable income,"" Kilian said. ""They can afford a $30,000 toy."" Factors like the economy and this year's long hard winter probably got people more excited about Bike Week because it's a chance to get away, he said. ""Everybody needs a break."" Ken Logan, 50, a radio producer from Orlando, Florida, has been going to Bike Week for four years. He said he goes to ""keep updated on motorcycle stuff as far as styles, what's done to them, meet people who enjoy bikes, to get patches and all the toy stuff, so to speak, and enjoy other people who enjoy the same thing."" The ride from Orlando is only 35 minutes, and he said that's half the fun. ""Everybody should go -- whether you have a bike or not -- at least once, just to take it in and see what it's about,"" Logan said. Bobby Mitchell, 52, also a radio producer in Orlando, grew up in Daytona Beach and has been going to Bike Week his entire life. He said it's been more fun in recent years, though. ""It's more fun when you actually have a motorcycle,"" he said. ""You get out there and ride alongside people. You're part of the roar, the noise."" Not only is Bike Week becoming more family-friendly, but it's more diverse as well, with more women participants, said Kathleen Tolleson, president and CEO of Roar Motorcycles. There's even a ""sisterhood bikeride"" in which 35 to 50 women ride together. Daytona Beach-based Roar Motorcycles specifically markets accessories and motorcycles for women. This year, Tolleson said, the company is unveiling a new motorcycle designed by women and made specifically for women and their needs. ""It's becoming more culturally acceptable, so more and more women are riding."" she said. The bike has a lower seat so that a woman can use her legs and hips when picking the bike off the stand, and can put her feet firmly on the ground when stopped. Most bikes are designed for men, who have more upper body strength and longer limbs. ""Women,"" she said, ""need a lower center of gravity."" The company is taking orders now, and the bikes will be available in six to nine months.",0.58842266,7588
93,"Editor's note: Clark Howard, the Atlanta, Georgia-based host of a nationally syndicated radio show, is host of a television show designed to help viewers save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times. The show airs at noon and 4 p.m. ET Saturdays and Sundays on HLN. Clark Howard says use the Internet to hook up with powerful networking groups. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Many years ago, I had the opportunity to start an Atlanta-based civic program called Career Action. The program's goal was to provide free resources to help the jobless and underemployed find steady work. That was 1979. Today, it's 2009 and the need for job assistance is greater than ever as unemployment continues to rise. The conventional wisdom about education and employment -- that as your level of education rises, the less likely you are to be impacted by layoffs -- has been completely flipped on its head. This recession knows no boundaries in terms of education, skill level, training or years on the job. So, what do you do if you're laid off or have your hours cut at work? First, don't panic! You're going to need to apply for unemployment insurance. I'm hearing a lot of people badmouthing unemployment compensation. There's nothing shameful about it. Employers pay premiums over time during the good years to provide for those who get laid off in lean times. It's not beneath you to accept this insurance money. Next, you need to triage your finances so you know which debts to prioritize and which to neglect if your money runs out. Paying your car note is central to finding employment for most people. It's practically higher than paying your mortgage or rent. In fact, you may need to live with friends or relatives until you can get back on your feet. What shouldn't you prioritize paying? Your credit cards. People say, ""But that will hurt my credit..."" Look, if you're in a situation where there's no money coming in and you have to decide between paying the mortgage and putting food on the table, chances are your credit is already damaged. Once you get organized financially, it's time to job hunt. Looking for work is a full-time job and you need an action plan. Start by reviewing your list of contacts, but understand that people don't like to be called and asked if there's a job. But they do love to give advice that may lead to a job opportunity. Visit in person with your contacts if possible. I'm also a big believer in networking groups and unemployment support groups. Networking for jobs has become something of a lost art in our country because people think the Internet replaces everything else. It doesn't. However, there are ways to use the Internet to hook up with powerful networking groups. There's even a new organization called LaidOffCamp that is like a free day camp for the underemployed. According to the movement's Web site, it's ""an ad-hoc gathering of unemployed and nontraditionally employed people (including freelancers, entrepreneurs and startups) who want to share ideas and learn from each other."" You never know whom you might meet. When you are job hunting on the Internet, be sure to check out screen-scraper sites like SimplyHired and Indeed.com. They're both ""one-stop shops"" that collect content from all the traditional job sites such as Monster and Yahoo! HotJobs, plus the career pages of individual company sites. In addition, The Boston Globe recently recommended several specialty sites when you're looking for work in a specific field. BioSpace.com is geared toward the science and biotechnology fields; Idealist.org focuses on the nonprofit charity world; and for those who are 50 years or older, there's a site called WorkForce50.com. In the course of your job search, you may find that you need money immediately and can't sit around waiting for a job offer to materialize. In that case, certain skill sets -- Web design, programming, marketing and videography, to name a few -- lend themselves to consulting work or freelancing on a project. The Internet also offers a variety of sites that match freelancers up with employers. A recent article in The San Francisco Chronicle suggested ELance.com, oDesk.com, Guru.com and crowdSPRING.com as starting points. And if you can afford it after all of your necessities, it's always a great idea to keep your mind sharp by taking classes to improve your skills or learn new ones. You can never be too smart.",0.5851468,2681
94,"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book, ""Late Edition: A Love Story,"" will be published next month. Bob Greene recalls a radio exec who was ahead of his time by working an almost endless day. (CNN) -- I think perhaps the oddest person I have ever known was a man by the name of Robert Hyland. But the truly odd thing is that we all seem to have turned into him. Hyland was the vice president and general manager of KMOX radio, the 50,000-watt powerhouse in St. Louis, Missouri. He came to work every day at 2:30. In the morning. That's right: Hyland would show up at his office at 2:30 a.m. each day. He would then work straight through until 5 p.m. He didn't do this once in a while; he did it each and every day. He didn't do it to set an example for his employees. He did it because he couldn't seem to stop working. ""I'm not one of those people who need sleep to be refreshed,"" Hyland told me once. ""I'll go to bed between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., and I'll wake up at 1:30 a.m. I have an alarm clock, but I never set it. I wake up automatically. I shower and shave, and I'm at the office by 2:30."" I asked him if this schedule made any sense at all. ""It's a good time to get a lot of work done,"" he told me. ""The phone isn't ringing, and there are no distractions. I have a pile of paperwork on my desk, and I go through it."" At 9 a.m., he said -- after he had been at work for 6½ hours -- the other people at the office would show up. And he would keep going. Hyland may have seemed eccentric -- he readily understood that perception; he said to me: ""I think what you're thinking is that you're talking to a nut"" -- but if he had lived a little longer (he died of cancer in 1992 at the age of 71), he would have witnessed something that might have astonished even him: . The rest of the world joined him in his obsession. Hyland died just before the era in which everyone began using cell phones and staring at home computer screens. Society might never have been ready to do what he did -- come to the office in the middle of the night and routinely work 14½ hour days -- had the technology revolution not come along. But come along it did -- and with it came the erasure of all the boundaries that at one time separated the workday from leisure time. E-mails and text messages and BlackBerrys and all their digital cousins may have given us the illusion of freedom -- we tell ourselves that we are unfettered by traditional offices, that we can go anywhere we please -- yet in the end they have created a nation of Robert Hylands. We're never off the clock; that cell phone may ring at dinnertime, that allegedly urgent e-mail may arrive at 11 p.m., that instant message from the regional manager may pop onto the screen when we're on vacation with our families. And what do we do? If your answer is, ""We ignore them,"" good for you. But the truth is, mostly we don't ignore them -- mostly we snap to attention. Ask yourself this: What do you think would happen to an employee who received an e-mail at home from his boss at 8 o'clock on a Tuesday night, and who responded to the e-mail by writing back: . ""I'm sorry, but I'm only available for work-related e-mails during office hours. If you'd like to communicate with me about this matter, please feel free to do so tomorrow after 9 a.m."" That might be the rational answer. But how many people -- especially in this economy, and in this job market -- do you think would dare to do that? And it's not just when we're working for our bosses -- it's when we're purportedly doing things for ourselves. Try to picture your father's or grandfather's reaction if in, say, 1958, he had been trying to make an airplane reservation and he had been told by the airline: . ""We'd like you to purchase a computer and set it up inside your house. You pay for it; you also pay for the electricity to run it. Now, we'd like you to buy a printing machine -- you pay for that, and you pay for the ink inside it, and you pay for the paper that feeds into it. Now, we'd like you to use the computer you've paid for to do the work of reservation agents, so we don't have to hire as many of them. Got it? Now, use that computer, make your own reservations, and print out your own ticket. On your own time."" Had your dad or granddad been told that, half a century ago, he might have thought he was having a nightmare. But we're grateful for it; we tell ourselves this is progress. If we log on at the moment the seat-selection process opens up, and we manage, by playing airline-roulette on our keyboard, to get ourselves an aisle seat, we feel triumphant. We barely stop to consider that we're working for the very airline company to which we're paying our money. Robert Hyland said he would feel funny not working all those hours -- he even did it on Saturdays; on the sixth workday of his week he would come in, as usual, at 2:30 a.m. ""I just don't think that most people have the commitment to their jobs that I do,"" he told me. If only he had lived to see 2009. He would have been just a face in the crowd -- just another American to whom the notion of quitting time has lost all meaning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.",0.5831037,4849
95,"(CNN) -- Nicole Nagy had gone back to school hoping that a new career would lead to a better job. When she was turned down for financial aid, Nagy was told she could, as a song goes, ""sing for the money."" She was directed to a contest called Careereoki. Nicole Nagy enlisted the help of her children and her husband to make her videotape. Anyone brave enough to videotape themselves singing -- and sometimes dancing -- about their dream career karaoke-style was qualified to enter the competition. More than 60 videos were submitted, from which five finalists were chosen to compete for online votes that will determine the winner. Most contestants were from Central Florida, likely because the grand prize includes tuition for a certificate program at an Orange County technical school. Nagy, a mother of three, was laid off in 2007. When she couldn't find a job, her husband supported her decision to enroll in nursing school. But tuition and books are costly, and the Nagys are a month behind on the mortgage payment. So risking embarrassment, Nagy decided a better future might lie in her music video. ""I can't sing to save my life, but I will go ahead and try this because I am willing to do anything to get school paid for,"" Nagy said. Her husband, obviously a good sport, appears in the video along with her children.  Watch the contestants' videos » . Dressed in a bathrobe, she sits on the couch with her kids as her husband starts the video with the bad news, ""OK guys, I have to go to work. Sorry we can't send you to nursing school, Mom. We just don't have the money."" Nagy replies, ""Ahh man."" Addressing her children, she says, ""know what we can do instead, we can sing about it."" Nagy takes off the robe, revealing a nursing uniform and the stethoscope which acts as her microphone. Nagy then dances around her living room, belting out her tune, ""Doctor, doctor give me the news; I got a bad case of nursing blues."" She sings her original lyrics to Robert Palmer's ""Bad Case of Loving You"" as her young, obedient children wait for the song to end. Nagy's video was good enough to gain her a spot as a Careereoki finalist. But winning the contest won't be as easy as making it to the finals. The Careereoki competition is stiff. American Idol judging it was not for this first-time contest. To choose the final five videos, judges considered three categories. Points were awarded based 50 percent on the contestant's originality, 25 percent on creativity and 25 percent on the video's humor. Whether Nagy's performance will be good enough to win will depend on how many people vote for her on local radio station WPYO's Web site where the videos are posted. Fans of the musical Grease may feel inclined to vote for Julia Langston of Lake Mary, Florida. Langston does a nice job singing what is supposed to be a duet, ""Summer Nights."" She creatively sings, ""Unemployment happened so fast, never thought this recession would last."" Langston was laid off a few months ago after working for 15 years as an office manager. As with her fellow contestants, the grand prize would be a huge help for her. She is living off the money she had set aside to remodel her kitchen. Finalist Jennifer Faulk of Deltona, Florida, sums up the recurring theme of the five still standing: ""The day does not go by that I don't go online and look for something and there's just nothing out there."" The Careereoki contest was sponsored by the Orange County School Board; Workforce Central Florida, an Orlando-area job placement organization; and a local advertising agency. Workforce Vice President Kimberly Cornett said her organization's participation in the singing contest helped spread the word on their ""no-cost services"" to the community. ""It was a way to connect to job seekers, and also for job seekers to take a little break from the stress of unemployment,"" Cornett said. She said she sees that stress first hand; the Orlando organization she works for offers job placement. Unemployment in Central Florida is the highest it has been in 16 years, according to Cornett. The grand prize is worth $8,000 and includes a career training scholarship, personal and resume makeovers and a $100 gas card. Two first-place winners will also get tuition help, resume makeovers and $50 gas cards. The finalists are keeping their fingers crossed that the song in their heart doesn't end up a song sung blue. The winner will be announced on Monday.",0.58294284,2129
96,"BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Seth Barrett really enjoys his work. ""I love the variety of projects,"" he says. ""I love a new puzzle every day."" Seth Barrett is surrounded by scores of projects in his shop, ""Village Green Renewal."" He's at his workbench, chisel in hand, shaving bits of wood from one of several chairs brought into his repair shop by a customer. ""She asked me to give them some attention and get them to stay together,"" Barrett says. His shop, ""Village Green Renewal,"" will fix almost anything that can fit in the front door, as long as it doesn't require any kind of special licensing or permits. Barrett hopes that by getting people to repair items instead of replacing them with new ones, it will mean less trash heading for the landfill. ""The aim of the business is really about bringing back a traditional approach to conservation,"" says Barrett, ""because, clearly, the single best way to be green is to re-use the things that we already have.""  Watch Barrett in his shop » . His small shop is tucked into a corner of a building in Brookline, Massachusetts, on the outskirts of Boston. Old glass doorknobs, brass curtain rings and even a 1930s stove are some of the many functional and non-functional items that decorate the walls, cases and every corner. From his workbench, Barrett has a clear view of the pedestrians who pass by. ""Everybody who walks past the window smiles, without fail,"" he says, and customers seem to be responding to this unique and somewhat old-fashioned business. ""I think people are really excited too about the prospect of being able to repair these things that have been sitting in their basement forever that were once really special to them, and are, now, almost a sore spot, because it's just getting dusty and getting no attention."" A customer enters. ""I found another chair for you,"" says Beth Harris, hoisting a black and white chair into the shop. She has an old house and if she's not bringing in a set of chairs that need mending, she might be in looking for an unusual hardware item that Barrett probably has. ""It's great to have a resource that's right in the neighborhood,"" Harris says. Toasters, chairs and lamps are some of the things Barrett commonly fixes. But, occasionally, an odd item like a fancy purse or an old typewriter comes in. ""The more interesting the item is, the more time I'll spend on it off the clock,"" Barrett says. If he's really intrigued by the repair, he says, ""I sit and keep playing with this thing because it's cool."" What would be the most unusual request? ""The pigs win it, hands down,"" Barrett says, referring to a pair of leather pigs that needed some serious stitching up. He worked on them for many more hours than he actually billed because he enjoyed figuring out how to do it. Besides, as Barrett points out, ""How often do you see two giant leather pigs?"" For years, Barrett worked in large construction projects, renovating houses and building additions, but there was something about it that bothered him. ""I've always been made upset by all the bits of construction that go in the trash, and all the interesting stuff is overlooked because it takes time,"" he says. ""Large-scale construction is fraught with tremendous waste and no time to attention and beauty."" That's what draws him to these small, simple projects -- not only is he providing a service, but he also is an integral part of the community he grew up in, his home being about 700 feet away from the shop. Barrett feels a bond with many of his customers, because every item that comes in has a story that comes with it, and he's more than happy to hear that story. He enjoys working with the small details and says his job is very peaceful. ""I'm not trying to change the world. I'm just trying to bring something beautiful to my little corner of it.""",0.58217776,7451

He writes a weekly column, How We Work, for HarvardBusiness.org. Peter Bregman says recession is an opportunity to reorient the focus of your working life to what you love to do. NEW YORK (CNN) -- A friend of mine, a senior leader in a pharmaceutical company, spends all her spare time doing yoga, taking classes in comparative religions, reading about spirituality, speaking with others about their beliefs. Just talking about it energizes her. Which is not how she feels about her day job. ""Why don't you leave your job and do something with this full time?"" I asked her. ""I've thought about it. But I could never make the kind of money I make now."" She might be right. But the question isn't whether she could make as much money. Even if she stays in her job she's unlikely to do that in this economy. The question is far broader and more interesting. What would her life look like -- in every dimension she values -- if she decided to pursue her passion full time? She needs to consider the contribution she'd make. The relationships she'd foster. The fun she'd have. The feelings she'd carry with her throughout the day. Her engagement in her work. In short, what her life would mean. And, of course, also the money. Which, as it turns out, might actually be greater if she were more engaged in her work. Gallup has collected data on 5.4 million employees in over 137 countries and concluded that engaged employees are more productive and customer-focused. And more profitable. Which could mean more money for her. But why are we even having this conversation during the worst downturn this country has seen in the last 70 years? Isn't she lucky simply to have a job? Yes. And, because of that, she's also stuck. For better and worse, she probably won't leave. But maybe you're not so lucky -- you've been laid off or might be soon; you're a student coming into the job market; or like several people I know, you've been thinking about a change. Well, this is your opportunity. You didn't want to risk a change when things were going well. There was too much to lose. But this downturn, this economic mess we're in, could be your chance. When everything was going well, we spent money we didn't have thinking we would make more tomorrow. Well, tomorrow came. It's easy to point a finger at Bernie Madoff (and he deserves the finger), but the truth is, it's not just him. We're all victims of our own little Ponzi Schemes. But now we know. The life we've been living, the debt we've been incurring, is unsustainable. Maybe the layoff is a favor. You were treated as expendable. But were you, working those long hours to keep a job you didn't love, treating your self as expendable too? Depressing? Sure. But now that we know, we can do something about it. I don't want to be cavalier; I know food on the table is a necessity. We still need work and money. Here are our new rules for finding it: . Rule #1: Don't spend too much time looking for your next job. As I discuss in my article for Harvard Business, ""Need to Find a Job? Stop Looking So Hard,"" searching for a job more than 1-2 hours a day will actually make it less likely you'll find one. Rule #2: Focus your time on what you're truly passionate about. Get more training. Expand your comfort zone with new activities, new people. Studies show that 80 percent of jobs are found through networking. Which is what you're doing when you pursue your passion with other people. So do it without guilt. Spend your newfound spare time doing what you enjoy with people whom you enjoy. Rule #3: Let those people know you want to make your money doing these things. Don't hammer it in. Just mention it. Once. Successful people are passionate, obsessed. And obsession isn't motivated by money. It's deeper than that. Find your obsession. Let it loose. Employers want to hire someone who is naturally driven. Self-motivated. You'll work at your obsession all the time because you want to. And that kind of persistence, that kind of focus, is worth a lot of money. But don't make the mistake of chasing the money. That's what got us into this mess in the first place. Let the money chase you. iReport.com: Brown-bagging lunch to save money? Send video . Most people are afraid to do that. Afraid of the risk. Afraid of the gap in their resume. They try to cover it up. Find ways to explain it away. But my advice to employers is hire for the gap. It's often the most interesting part of a person's life. What does a person do when they don't have anything they have to do? What do they do in their spare time? If you can hire someone for that, you'll find your star. This isn't the time to be afraid of risk. It's too late. You're already in the risk. You might not have chosen it, but why not take control and act as if you had? Remember my friend working at the pharmaceutical company -- the one with the job? By staying in work she doesn't love, she's taking a risk too. She's risking her life. Imagine how great she would be, how much she would offer, how much she would gain, if she devoted herself to her passion? Now how about you? Let's become a nation of people who love what we do.

98,"(CNN) -- If you're looking for love and not having much luck, maybe you could increase your success by getting a bit more passionate -- about helping others. Dave Chung and Kim Benty share a love of volunteer work in New Orleans. When singles write to advice columnists complaining about being lonely, they are often urged to volunteer. Duane Bates, the public relations director for Habitat for Humanity, says it's not unusual for their volunteers to meet on a building site and ""end up together."" Victor Fasolino was living in New Jersey and his future wife, Lora, was living in Seattle, Washington, when the two met in Hungary in 1996 while volunteering on a Jimmy Carter Work Project for Habitat. ""I thought she was an attractive young lady,"" recalls Victor Fasolino, adding that they were working 10-12 hour days so it wasn't until the project was almost complete that they got to spend much time together. Both were committed volunteers and had signed up for a Habitat fundraising bike ride of 500 miles two weeks after they returned to the United States. They got to know each other while pedaling from Kentucky to Atlanta, Georgia. The two got married one year later atop a house they helped build during another project in Pikesville, Kentucky. Other volunteers had cleaned and scraped a ladder so the bride wouldn't get her wedding gown dirty climbing to the roof. The groom wore a tuxedo, a local minister officiated and a fiddler joined them on the roof to provide the music. This year, Victor, 56, and Lora Fasolino, 46, will again work on former President Carter's 2009 Habitat work project, building houses in five countries: Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and China -- along the Mekong River in southeast Asia. In 2007, Dave Chung and Kim Benty found each other while helping Hurricane Katrina victims in New Orleans, Louisiana. Chung had been a pro golfer playing mini-tours in California and living half the year in Toronto, Ontario, when he got the urge to drive down to New Orleans to volunteer. ""I really liked the place, and the people,"" says Chung. ""The original plan was to come down here for two months and go to a friend's wedding, but I ended up staying."" At first the 30-something golfer worked for Habitat for Humanity, learning plumbing and wiring. Then he went to work with Liz McCartney, 2008 CNN Hero of the Year, at the St. Bernard Project. Meanwhile, Kim Benty, 36, an interpreter for the deaf in the western New York town of Batavia, began a series of trips in July 2007 to work with volunteers in the same area. Benty was smitten after meeting Chung on her first trip, but he merely smiled and went back to work. ""He was doing a little of everything, a runner, bringing supplies, our construction manager,"" Benty remembers. ""I thought, you know, I am just another volunteer to him."" There were several more trips, a few chance meetings -- but no sparks. But something changed when they met yet again in December 2008 at a friend's Christmas party. ""We just hit it off that night,"" Chung says. Chung says he was attracted to her for a million little reasons: ""She's attractive, fun to be around and both of us are kind of easygoing."" But then it was time for Benty to go back to New York and for Chung to make the long drive to Canada to see his relatives. Chung's New Year's Eve plans fell though, so he asked Benty about coming down. They hung out for a few days and Chung was set to drive by himself back to New Orleans. ""She hopped in the car with me, and came down. It really surprised the people who knew her,"" Chung says, ""because she is the kind of person who likes to plan everything."" ""Ha, it did surprise people,"" Benty admits. ""I am very conservative, a planner, it was out of context for me."" They both admit they are at a crossroads of sorts. Psychologist Diana Kirschner, author of the book, ""Love in 90 Days,"" says the couple's relationship could go either way. ""I've seen couples come together in some kind of mission or some kind of movement, and they work together really well when they're within the mission. There's a sense of a bond because of their joint commitment to the mission,"" says Kirschner. ""But then when the mission ends, or if it ends, they just look at each other and find they have nothing in common."" ""However, I've also seen it where couples come together like this and basically decide to stay on the mission the rest of their lives. And they marry and they stay on the mission. Their marriage is all about being together and helping each other fulfill their purpose in this mission,"" Kirschner says. That's what happened to Carol and John Coonrod, who met in 1985 while working for several weeks in Washington on a book promotion for the The Hunger Project, an organization dedicated to ending hunger and poverty in the world. ""The last night when we all went out for a drink, we kind of looked at each other and noticed who we'd been working with all that time -- and we've been together ever since,"" said Carol Coonrod, 62, adding that her husband, 57, always says, ""We're living happily ever after."" The couple, who have no children, are both on staff at the organization. ""We've had a relationship that was formed within The Hunger Project and that has always been our senior mission, part of a senior commitment,"" said Carol Coonrod. ""And within that we've created a partnership and a marriage."" Their shared passion for their work has driven them during their more than two-decade marriage. ""As we've gotten older, we've sort of rediscovered the rest of life and we've continued to be partners, not only in work, but also in our leisure and the rest of our life. We're wonderfully compatible and enjoy vacation and nonwork time as much as working together,"" says the veteran volunteer. The younger volunteer couple is still pondering their relationship. ""We're not trying to put pressure on ourselves, we are trying to have a good time,"" Chung says. But they are certain about one thing. ""Our passion is to be down here with the St. Bernard Project,"" says Benty. ""You know, that is how life works,"" Chung said. ""It works in strange ways. Stuff you don't plan on is the stuff you remember.""",0.5800477,2075
99,"(CNN) -- German logistics giant Deutsche Post said Monday it was cutting 9,500 jobs as part of a major program to restructure its loss-making DHL delivery service in the United States. DHL's restructuring is expected to result in heavy job losses. Deutsche Post said it would discontinue its U.S. ground and air delivery operations based out of Wilmington, Ohio, following an outsourcing agreement with UPS. DHL Express will continue to operate between the United States and other nations, the company said in a statement. DHL's 9,500 job cuts are on top of 5,400 job cuts announced earlier this year. The statement said DHL was shutting down all ground hubs and reducing its number of stations to 103 from 412. The company said it was making the cuts to improve profitability and ""to prepare the company for the economic challenges ahead."" DHL Express is owned by the German company Deutsche Post World Net. Officials in Ohio had been hoping to prevent layoffs. State senator Sherrod Brown sent a letter Sunday to DHL Express Chief Executive Officer John Mullen and urged employment officials in Washington for emergency funds to assist workers and communities affected. In May, Deutsche Post announced plans to outsource air services with UPS. Brown says the plan would mean shutting down DHL's hub in Wilmington and cutting at least 8,000 jobs. Brown testified at two congressional hearing this year that centered on the proposal. Prior to the announcement, Wilmington Mayor David Razik said he was preparing for the worst. ""Given the state of the economy and the world wide economic collapse we know it can't be good news,"" he told CNN Sunday night. ""Freight is down significantly, DHL is losing customers, they have laid off sales personnel in other locations. We really think it's certainly not going to be good for Wilmington.""",0.57853204,1245
101,"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Disney World has not been the happiest place on Earth for employees this year. The Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, has lost some 1,600 jobs. Imagine one day receiving recognition for decades of service from your employer only to be laid off the next day. That is what happened to one Walt Disney Parks and Resorts employee who asked not be identified. Disney has eliminated 1,900 U.S.-based positions since mid-February. Some 900 salaried employees working at Disney's theme parks in Florida were laid off, and 700 open positions were eliminated, said communications Vice President Mike Griffin. In California, 200 workers were laid off and 100 open positions were cut. Disneyland in California and Disney World are having their behind-the-scenes operations combined in a restructuring, said Griffin. Disney officials say theme parks, the Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club and off-property resorts have seen some people with decades of experience laid off during the restructuring. The former employee let go after decades of service is still hoping to return once the economy improves. Several other employees said they did not want speak to CNN in fear of jeopardizing the generous severance packages offered by Disney. Employees let go will receive pay for 60 days; extended medical coverage; and severance packages that vary according to their years of service, said a Disney source. Disney's Griffin said: ""These decisions were not made lightly, but are essential to maintaining our leadership in family tourism and reflect today's economic realities."" Central Florida's unemployment rate is 9.7 percent -- a 33-year high, according to the area's job service agency, Workforce Central Florida. The rate is more than double from the same time a year ago. The job agency's spokeswoman, Kimberly Cornett, said 40,000 to 50,000 people registered with the agency are vying for 1,000 jobs available through Workforce Central Florida. Fewer than 100 available job listings are in the tourism industry. Cornett said she does not believe Disney's layoffs will have a significant effect to the area's overall economy, since currently 107,000 people are unemployed in Central Florida. Cornett said, however, that the effect would be huge for those laid off. Orlando area hotels have been hit hard, too, with fewer tourist and business travelers. Orange County reported in February it collected 29 percent less revenue in a hotel bed tax in comparison to a year ago, said Brian Martin of the Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau. Martin said the large drop is due to fewer booked hotel rooms at reduced rates to attract visitors. The convention and visitors bureau, in a survey of area hotels, has found companies are traveling less for meetings in Orlando. The hotels report that in the first two months of 2009, some 114 small business meetings were canceled, with $26 million in lost revenue. Martin said the White House is partly to blame for the dropoff in business meetings. President Obama said companies that receive taxpayer bailout money should not use the money to ""go take a trip to Las Vegas."" ""When the president said 'don't travel,' business travel has been affected,"" Martin said. Las Vegas is the country's most popular convention destination, with Orlando No. 2. Orlando has not seen any large convention cancellations in 2009, the convention bureau says. Statistics from 2007, the latest available, show that even if Orlando saw a 10 percent drop in visitors, nearly 44 million people would still come to the city. Disney's 2008 financial report showed income was down last year. Disney would not comment on whether park attendance was up or down. A source within Disney said that even though the theme parks are crowded, customers are not buying. Disney's Mike Griffin said: ""We continue to work through our reorganization and manage our business based on demand."" Griffin said the corporation's reorganization has been under way since 2005 and many of the recent positions eliminated would have eventually been cut. Due to the economy, Griffins said, the cuts took place sooner than expected. He added that Disney is downsizing just like many other U.S. businesses.",0.57727003,6324
102,"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- If you're out of work like Steve Lippe, who was laid off from his job as a salesman in January, you know you already have problems. But looking at the fine print that came with his new unemployment debit card, he became livid. A brochure that goes out to Pennsylvanians seeking unemployment via debit card lists a number of fees. ""A $1.50 [fee] here, a $1.50 there,"" he said. ""Forty cents for a balance inquiry. Fifty cents to have your card denied. Thirty-five cents to have your account accessed by telephone."" He was quoting fees listed in a brochure that goes out to every unemployed person in Pennsylvania who chooses to receive benefits via debit card. He was given the option when he filed for jobless payments: Wait 10 days for a check or get the card immediately. Like most of the 925,000 state residents who received unemployment benefits in February in Pennsylvania, he chose the debit card and only then, he says, did he learn about the fees. ""I was outraged by it,"" he told CNN. ""I was very noisy about it. I just couldn't believe it. An outrage is just too weak a word. It's obscene."" According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 30 states offer direct deposit cards to the unemployed. Many of the nation's biggest banks have contracts with the individual states. JP Morgan Chase, for instance, has contracts with seven states and has pending deals with two others, according to Chase spokesman John T. Murray. About 10 states, the Labor Department says, pay by check only. The National Consumer Law Center says fees range from 40 cents to a high of $3 per transaction, if the debit card is used at an out-of-network ATM. Most banks give jobless debit card users one free withdrawal per deposit period, which averages every other week in most states. But consumer advocates, including the Law Center, say the unemployed ""should be able to obtain cash and perform basic functions with no fees."" A key Democratic member of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees bank regulation and theTroubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), told CNN she agrees wholeheartedly. ""Fees should not be attached to unemployment benefits that the taxpayers are paying to help Americans,"" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, told CNN. ""Particularly, these fees should not be attached by banks that are getting TARP money and are being supported by taxpayer dollars."" CNN asked some of the major banks involved in the debit card program for a response. Spokesmen for JP Morgan Chase, Wachovia, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all directed us to the individual state governments for comment. The acting secretary of labor and industry for Pennsylvania is Sandi Vito. Via e-mail, her staff invited CNN reporters to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where she was taking part at a public meeting at an elementary school. Afterward, she said, she would answer questions about the debit card fees. But when the meeting ended, her staff said she was too busy to talk.  Watch Vito leave meeting in a hurry » . Her spokesman, Troy A. Thompson, spoke with CNN after Vito left. ""The distribution system for people getting their benefits has been improved by the use of debit cards, way above and beyond the distribution by check,"" he said. The U.S. Department of Labor provided what it called ""talking points"" to CNN when asked for comment on the fee structure. ""States can do a better job negotiating fees with banks,"" the department said. ""Many states have obtained terms far more favorable to claimants than those described in media reports."" In addition, according to the talking points, the Labor Department said it was aware states are offering unemployment debit cards for good reasons: . •  It is less expensive for claimants without bank accounts because they don't need to pay check cashing fees. • Claimants can use the card free at merchants and therefore don't need to carry excess cash. • Generally, these cards are safer and more secure than checks. ""We will be working with states as they gain experience with debit cards to resolve these problems related to fees,"" the Labor Department said.",0.57712245,3001
103,"LINKENHOLT, England (CNN) -- Hidden away in the hills of Hampshire lies the village of Linkenholt. This idyllic community, home to just 50 people comes complete with grand Edwardian manor house, cricket pavilion and grounds, blacksmith's forge, rectory, shooting grounds, 22 houses and grade 2 listed cottages. The current owner has ensured that houses are not sold off in the near future. It's all one could ever want from a quintessential English village, and now it is on sale for $33 million. Once owned by English cricketer Herbert Blagrave, the estate was left to his own charitable trust which has now put the entire village -- church not included -- up for sale. ""That,"" joked local estate agent Tim Sherston, ""is owned by God."" In times of financial downturn and falling house prices, the decision to sell up is curious. The trust says though it wants to free up the capital tied up in the estate so it can give more to charity on an annual basis. Sherston maintains that Linkenholt is not only a rare opportunity; it is a sound buy. ""Big time investors will look upon it as a safe haven to place their money because in five years you're going to see a great deal of appreciation here, so this is perfect."" The new owner could also take away a significant income from the rent of the houses.  Watch as village goes on sale » . Likely buyers are private individuals interested either in farming or the shoot, regarded as one of the finest in the south of England, according to Sherston. There has also been some foreign interest though he adds ""the village is run very much as it has been for the last 200 to 300 years and it is the trustees' hope that the new owner will continue to run it in the same manner."" Provisions have been made by the trust to ensure the houses are not sold off in the near future. Only the manor house will be vacant for the new owner. But locals do worry about their new landlord. The village thatcher Paul Raynsford told CNN: ""I'd sooner not see a banker or someone who's going to asset strip it. I'd like to see a film star, pop star, footballer, someone who just wants to buy it so they can say 'I'm the lord of the manor.'"" Ray Smith, known locally as ""the Sheriff,"" has worked as the estate's manager for 50 years. He says: ""I'd like to see an Englishman live in the manor, run the farm and the shoot like it used to be."" Indeed, Linkenholt is idyllic; within the beautiful surroundings classified as an area of outstanding beauty, this is a village full of characters and local tales. Ray's wife Elsie talks of how they met as teenagers cycling past each other everyday on the way to work along the same path. Stopping one day to help with her broken bike, they have been together ever since. He made the permanent move to Linkenholt when the keeper before him caused a local scandal when caught illegally shooting the ground's deer. Two doors down lives Elsie's sister, who is married to Ray's brother. The sisters were born here, christened and later married in the church here, worked in the cricket club, and though their own children have moved further afield, they would never leave. Their father even died on Linkenholt's cricket ground during a game in the 1930s. Having dedicated their lives to the village, the Smiths and childhood friend Alan Dewey, another original local, were given the houses in which they live by the trust. Ray adds: ""I'm on holiday all the time. With a place like this to sit in the sun and look at all the views, I don't think you'd want to go anywhere else."" Though the media has shone a temporary light on Linkenholt, the hope after the arrival of the new owner is that the village will revert back to times of old, unspoilt and wonderfully English. Reiterating the ideal of having a new lord of the manor, blacksmith Colin Boast adds: ""We would like to see someone come in and take the village to their heart and to love it like the people here do.""",0.570023,3486
104,"(CNN) -- Ever find yourself struggling to craft the perfect sentence for a loved one who's, um, serving a sentence? Now, you have a friend in the greeting card business. Terrye Cheathem has created a line of greeting cards geared toward prison inmates. A Los Angeles, California, lawyer has come up with a series of cards geared toward prison inmates, a rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population. Some express simple good wishes: ""We are all praying for you while you do your time."" Others celebrate holidays: ""You had the choice to be 'naughty or nice.' And you chose ... Now you have to do your time. But, Christmas won't be the same without you here."" Others dole out tough love: ""When you called last time, I was not very sympathetic. I guess that I have heard your promises to change too many times. Please - stop promising to change. Just do it."" Creator Terrye Cheathem said the cards let family members say ""Look, things need to be different when you get out."" She came up with the idea a few years ago while looking -- without success -- for a birthday card to send her brother-in-law, who was serving an 11-month sentence. ""There are so many people who have mixed feelings about communicating with their loved ones in prison,"" Cheathem said Thursday. ""They are unhappy, oftentimes profoundly embarrassed. People don't know what to say."" So she created Three Squares Greetings to capture the sentiments for a captive audience -- one that seems to be getting larger each year. More than 2.3 million people were in jails or prisons in the United States at the beginning of 2008, according to a study released last month by the Pew Center on the States.

105,"(CNN) -- Target Corp. this month will open 27 new stores employing a total of more than 4,300 people, the company said. One of Target's two new Hawaii stores awaits its Sunday grand opening. The stores' openings will come just weeks after the retailer cut 600 people from its headquarters staff amid what it called weaker-than-expected sales. The retailer will hold grand openings for the 21 general merchandise stores and six full-grocery SuperTarget stores on Sunday. The new sites include the company's first two stores in Hawaii. Each general merchandise store employs 150 to 250 people, and each SuperTarget has 200 to 300 workers, the company said. In late January, Minnesota-based Target cut its headquarters staff by 9 percent and eliminated 400 open positions. The company, citing difficult economic conditions and sales that didn't meet expectations, also said it would soon close an Arkansas distribution center that employs 500 people and would cut back on planned new-store openings. ""We are clearly operating in an unprecedented economic environment that requires us to make some extremely difficult decisions to ensure Target remains competitive over the long term,"" Gregg Steinhafel, Target president and CEO, said in a news release that month. Retailers in the United States took a hit last year as a weak economy weighed on consumer spending. Retail sales fell six straight months until January, when sales rose 1 percent, according to the Commerce Department. However, retail experts said they were skeptical a rebound had taken hold. Still, two other retailers also announced plans to expand. Kohl's announced last month that it intends to open 55 stores in 2009, and Dollar General in February said it is looking to open more than 400 stores. Target reported its fourth-quarter net earnings were 40.7 percent lower than the same quarter a year earlier. Same-store sales in January were 3.3 percent lower than a year earlier. December same-store sales fell 4.1 percent. Target's new general merchandise stores are in Rogers, Arkansas; Santa Clarita, California; Pensacola, Florida; Bethlehem, Georgia; Honolulu and Kapolei, Hawaii; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Las Vegas, Nevada; Paramus, New Jersey; Cincinnati, Lebanon and Reynoldsburg, Ohio; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; Philadelphia and Exton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Houston, San Antonio and San Marcos, Texas; Midlothian, Virginia; and Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. The new SuperTarget stores are in Kissimmee, Florida; Canton, Georgia; Hillside, Illinois; and Pflugerville, Allen and Lewisville, Texas. The new locations will increase the number of Target stores to 1,699, the company said. CNNMoney.com's Parija B. Kavilanz contributed to this report.",0.5646755,8151
106,"ATLANTA, Georgia -- Going back to work after my wife had our first child was an emotional roller coaster. The author says that being ""Mr. Mom"" is appealing, but putting the idea into practice is harder than it looks. I forced myself out of bed, shaved my beard and got dressed on the morning of my return. I performed these work week rituals while cursing the fact that I matched only one number on my last lottery ticket, so I had to show up that day. After being out of the office for a little more than two weeks on paternity leave, I knew the transition back to work would be tough. I coped with this fact, like any rational new parent would, by increasing the number of lottery tickets that I purchased. Saying goodbye took a while. I made several trips up and down the stairs to get one more glimpse of my daughter before succumbing to the inevitable: my commute, fighting traffic and reintegrating to cubicle culture. I arrived at the office still thinking of my family at home without me. I found myself misty-eyed at the water cooler while I waited for Outlook to load several hundred unread e-mails. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to be at home with my daughter. The idea of being a stay-at-home dad, like Michael Keaton in ""Mr. Mom,"" always appealed to me. For the uninitiated, the 1983 comedy is about an out-of-work father faced with domestic challenges while his wife gets a job. A memorable scene has the title character, Jack Butler, trying to sound like he knows what he's talking about to his wife's new boss. He tells him that he plans to wire a new wing of his house in ""220, 221, whatever it takes."" I identify with the latter part of his character's claim. It's not like me to pretend to know anything about home improvement, but when it comes to caring for my family while balancing my responsibilities at work, I plan on doing whatever it takes. In 2007, 37 percent of working dads admitted that they would leave their jobs if their family could afford it, according to CareerBuilder.com. The ""if"" in that statistic is a big one. Unlike the characters in ""Mr. Mom,"" my wife and I both need to work. A good sequel to this film may have explored the hijinks that ensued from an overwhelmed parent caring for a newborn while working from home. Nowadays, there's support for all of the Jack Butlers out there. Web sites such as AtHomeDad.org and Rebeldad.com have established online communities dedicated to providing tips and resources for fatherhood. These forums represent a growing fellowship where those with experience can help new dads. Personally, I haven't utilized them much yet because of that old Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to be a member of a club that would have a person like me as a member. Available resources and social acceptance for stay-at-home dads have come a long way since ""Mr. Mom's"" portrayal of them. In fact, Salary.com calculated that a stay-at-home dad was worth $125,340 a year for the dad portion of his work in 2006. This analysis took into account tasks that range from cooking and cleaning to teaching and serving as a child psychologist. Since I can't convince anyone to pay me my estimated worth as an at-home dad -- and living on one salary isn't an option for my family -- I've considered working from home a couple of hours a week when necessary. Flexible work schedules make sense because they benefit a company by allowing employees to be more productive on their terms. Nevertheless, working from home may not be for everyone. I work for a news Web site, facilitating advertisement opportunities. A lot of my job's communication occurs via e-mail, which is something I can do at home. I'd worked from home before, but not with a newborn in the house. My first test was only for a couple of hours when the baby was about 3 weeks old. My wife had an early appointment, and I was going to watch the baby sleep, hopefully, and then go into the office after she got home. I had e-mail to check and two conference calls scheduled back-to-back during that time. I didn't expect this to be too difficult. I caught up on the e-mail much earlier than if I had gone into the office that morning. Unfettered from the restriction of the morning rituals, my productivity was already soaring and I was ahead of schedule. Then disaster struck. As I called into my first meeting, the baby started to stir, squirm and make her signature sounds (a primal series of grunts, snorts and whimpers). She was telling me that her diaper needed to be changed and that she was probably hungry, too. So I did what any multi-tasker would do: I put the phone under my ear, stuck her bottle under the tap, muted the phone, ran up the stairs with her in a tucked football position, unmuted the phone, answered a question, muted again, changed her diaper and ran down the stairs to get the bottle. My wife called while I was juggling the baby, diaper, bottle and meeting to let me know that she was running late. I screamed to myself, ""I need help NOW!"" Allowing the nervous breakdown to run its course, I continued to pace across my living room floor -- regretting that I hadn't chosen decaf that morning. A few minutes later, I jumped out of the first meeting to call into the second. I said, ""Hello, this is Josh, I'm here on mute, OK, thanks."" As I listened in on mute, I shushed my baby to calm her -- to no avail. Her cries became increasingly louder. My boss asked, ""Josh, are you there?"" I unmuted my phone and right on cue, my daughter screamed at the top of her little lungs. The conference room on the other end of the phone erupted with laughter, and I told them that I'd have to get back to them. My wife arrived home shortly after the conference-call debacle. I told her that I didn't think it would be a good idea for me to work from home anymore. I realize that the ability to work and be a nanny simultaneously is a skill requiring practice. One trial run as a telecommuter with a newborn has caused me to question the feasibility of being able to do it on a regular basis. Perhaps it's time for me to forget about that old Groucho Marx joke and accept some help. Wait, the baby's crying, sorry, gotta go.",0.56387615,2182

So much so that the Colorado resident and her husband threw a party Saturday for friends and family after mailing off the final check. The event at a community center featured a cake decorated with the debt amount in green icing, CNN television affiliate KUSA reported. The couple had been paying the debt for three years and seven months, Muldoon told CNN, adding that the last payment they made recently was for $1,500. ""When we mailed that last check ... I sat down in the car, I looked over to my husband and I just burst out into tears,"" she said. iReport.com: Have you paid off a huge debt lately? The typical American household with at least one credit card has nearly $10,700 in credit card debt, according to CardWeb.com. The average interest rate runs in the mid- to high teens, according to the Web site. Muldoon said the soaring costs of their nine credit cards left them with two options: Either file for bankruptcy or make a drastic lifestyle change. They opted for the latter, she told KUSA. ""We changed everything ... to bare-bones minimum,"" Muldoon told CNN. ""Basically, if it wasn't essential to support life, we didn't do it."" The Muldoons are part of a national trend in easing off credit card use. Total consumer borrowing fell 3.5 percent in February, from the month before, according to the Federal Reserve. A government report shows the tumble in consumer credit was caused by a sharp decline in credit card use. The ailing economy and controlled spending caused by unemployment have contributed. Muldoon said she found a way to make money by doing extra jobs, including teaching fitness classes at night and cleaning office buildings on the weekends.

Muldoon said the quest to save money extended to the party, which she hosted using items that were either on sale or had been purchased with coupons. No steak was served there, either: She used ham from ""a couple of pigs"" she raised last year.

109,"SARATOGA SPRINGS, New York (CNN) -- Two years ago, Dawn Warfield was drowning in debt. Dawn Warfield sold one of her two video stores to help reduce her debts. The average American household has $8,329 in credit card debt, according to the Nilson Report, a credit industry newsletter. Warfield had nearly 10 times that amount. At its worst point, her debt totalled nearly $80,000. She had 17 credit cards and admits that living beyond her means was part of the problem. ""I'll own up to that,"" she said. ""There is always unforeseen expenses, and when you are making the minimum payments on these credit cards, when you think you can't afford to make more than that, they don't go down."" But Warfield's spending was not the only factor working against her.  Watch Warfield describe how the debt piled up, and how she started paying it off » . She was in the middle of an expensive divorce and had been charging business expenses to her personal credit cards when she opened a second location of her video store. ""Every month I was writing out 17 checks,"" she said. ""And the interest rates ranged from like 6 percent to 33 percent. So it was impossible. ""I was transferring balances from one card to another, and every time I got a card to a decent interest rate, I felt like one of the cards would come off the promotional interest rate, and I was just never catching up."" So Warfield took matters into her own hands. She sold the second location of her video store, stopped using her credit cards and decided it was time to get help. ""I sat down one day and I called each credit card one by one, and I asked each one to work with me ... to lower my interest rate."" The credit card companies did not respond to her plea. Instead, she was directed to the debt management program of the nonprofit Consumer Credit Counseling Service, part of Money Management International. Counselor Eric Jackson helped Warfield analyze her bills and expenses and created a plan to help her get lower interest rates. Now she makes a single monthly payment. ""I don't even have to think about it, which makes it a lot easier for me, because when you have a lot of debt, it's not just financial, but it's emotional, you know, even physical,"" Warfield said. ""You think about it all the time."" Adds Jackson: ""She's making her payments on time, they're posting to her creditor accounts, she has very low interest rates -- that was one of the benefits -- and she's definitely doing well. ""She is on track to get all her debts paid off in full within the five years."" Today, Warfield is less than $40,000 in debt. ""I'm about halfway,"" she said.

She has since seen the resilience of the people in her generation as they adapt to a changing job market. CNN's Nicole Lapin talked to Evans about what young people should be doing to deal with the tough times. The following is an edited transcript of the interview: . Nicole Lapin: What do you tell young people to make economic news relevant to them?  Watch the entire interview with Kelly Evans » . Kelly Evans: We really, really do try to explain to people, past some of the language and the jargon, to say that economics is really about what's happening: your job, your income, demographics, poverty rates, and what it looks like across the country. There are some terms that may seem unfamiliar, but I think if you sit down and read through our coverage, you'll see that a lot of it makes sense.

Evans: Well, I think for most young people, the big thing right now is a career or a job path.

I think less people want to be in banking than did a few years ago, and so I'm curious as a reporter what is perceived to be the golden ticket nowadays.

But really make sure you're investing in your education or skills, maybe the language skills in particular, that will be really important down the road.

""I thought that was a great idea, so I started doing research on some of the recipes,"" says Boatman.

The horticulture program pays for itself, says Boatman, so no taxpayer money is used. Several times a year the program hosts a sale of its ornamentals, shrubs and trees, and the locals turn up to support the program. The money raised is used to purchase necessities like fertilizer and soil. A green thumb is not the only thing that inmate and program member Deline is developing, he says. ""We learn a lot about professionalism, respect, teamwork, ya know -- all that helps,"" Deline says. And working in the fields is good for the inmates' self-worth, Boatman says.

No one submitted the minimum $3.2 million bid for former Falcon Michael Vick's Atlanta-area mansion. The multimillion-dollar home in Duluth was on the auction block Tuesday, but just three real estate agents showed up -- and one of them, Lance Hempen of Funari Realty, was a listing agent who had no clients interested in the property. No one offered a bid, so the auction ended before it began. The auction required a minimum bid of $3.2 million, with a deposit of $160,000. Vick, 28, is serving a 23-month sentence after pleading guilty in August 2007 to a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. He is expected to be released early, possibly in May, and to serve the final two months or so of his sentence under home confinement, most likely in Virginia. No dogfights occurred in Duluth, 40 miles northeast of Atlanta. The home, in the upscale Sugarloaf Country Club community, has been on the market for more than a year. It has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a four-car garage and a movie theater, among other deluxe features. Narender Reddy of Metro Brokers/GMAC Real Estate said his client offered $3.2 million for the home two months ago, but the auction organizers said they wanted to see whether someone would offer more. Reddy said his client withdrew the bid but remains interested. ""Why would I let them use my offer as a benchmark?"" Reddy asked. ""I wanted to see who was going to bid and what were they going to offer."" He will advise his client to offer less money now, Reddy said. Seema Jain of Virtual Properties Realty also was on hand. She said that she has interested buyers but that they didn't want to bid if there was no competition. The next step is to be determined by the bankruptcy judge in Virginia who ordered the sale. Reddy said the price is too high for today's economy.

The girl's image signified the deep-rooted poverty in her rural community. Pam Koner is combating hunger by connecting sponsor and recipient families. The picture moved Koner to tears and inspired her to take action. ""When I read about a community so profoundly poor that women and children were not eating the last week of the month, I walked into my living room where my daughters were and said, 'We're going to do something as a family,' "" recalls Koner, a 57-year-old single mother of two living in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. In the seven years since, Koner's determination to help families in Pembroke led to the creation of Family-to-Family, a nonprofit that connects more than 600 sponsor and recipient families in 13 communities nationwide. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes. The project began with Koner contacting an outreach worker in Pembroke, who told her the town needed food more than anything else. Koner enlisted help from her neighbors and parents of children in her childcare business; the group began sending monthly boxes of food and basic household items to the neediest families in the Illinois town. ""People were excited to be a part of something,"" says Koner of her donor community. ""Something so little as shopping, packing and sending a box."" Through monthly food donations, Koner's organization has provided nearly 800,000 meals to struggling families across the country. For privacy purposes, she says, the group makes sure donor and recipient communities are at a distance, such as an Atlanta, Georgia, chapter helping a community in Kentucky or a Florida family helping a Navajo family in New Mexico. In addition to providing basic essentials, families exchange letters, swap photographs and share stories about cultural traditions and family events. ""There's a shared learning experience,"" says Koner. ""When a sponsoring family reads about a Navajo family lifestyle -- barren landscape, a trailer home with no electricity and no running water -- children get a profound, firsthand look at differences. Knowing that each other exists changes the way we look at the world.""  Watch Koner describe how the communities connect with each other » . The economic downturn has prompted Koner's group to broaden its outreach and sponsorship methods. Bedford-Stuyvesant, a community in Brooklyn, New York, of predominantly working-class African-Americans, is the group's only urban sponsored community. It is also one of the organization's cyber-adoption sites, where sponsor families participate through Paypal, an online money exchange tool. A food pantry buys and boxes up the food to give directly to the families. Koner also learned of families in her own Hastings-on-Hudson community in need of help. ""I was quite surprised,"" Koner says. ""Hastings is probably middle-class to upper-middle-class. It's not a showy community, but this was a community of families who were not in need of help before."" Her community has eagerly embraced its neighbors in need, she says, but unlike traditional sponsored families at a distance, Hastings-sponsored families presented privacy concerns. ""That there could be a child who was going to school with my child who I was helping ... we felt that was too personal and private. To respect the individual family in need [was] important for us since we live so close together,"" says Koner. To help maintain their anonymity, donations for the 11 sponsored families in Hastings are labeled by letters of the alphabet, so sponsor families have no identifiable information about who they're helping.

Despite economic challenges, Koner says she's noticed growing enthusiasm among families to become sponsors in her own community and beyond. ""I anticipated that we would really be affected, people would drop out. But that hasn't happened. We've actually launched new chapters of sponsoring families."" Koner attributes the outpouring of generosity to a heightened awareness for how tough times present a new outlook on giving.  Watch Koner and some sponsor families in action » . ""There are plenty of communities where families are struggling themselves, but will keep this as part of their budget,"" she says. ""We're all affected. No one knows what's going to happen tomorrow.

116,"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Reporters, editors and photographers at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer prepared their final contributions to the paper, toasted one another with shots of Wild Turkey and packed up their desks in an ""eerily clean"" newsroom as the final edition of the paper went to the presses Monday night. SeattlePI.com will continue to cover breaking news, Managing Editor Dave McCumber says. The paper -- which was the oldest continually operating business in Seattle -- published its final print edition Tuesday as the P-I makes a transformation into an online-only news outlet. A skeleton crew of 20 to 25 staffers will remain at the new Seattle PI.com while more than 140 staffers will lose their jobs. ""Its been an opportunity to experience your community first-hand,"" staff photographer Meryl Schenker said of her 13 years with the paper. ""You meet people from all walks of life, and that's been a real privilege."" P-I journalists coming into the newsroom Monday morning were told by management that they would ""put the paper to bed for the last time"" that day. Other reporters and photographers on assignment when the news broke received texts about it from their colleagues. The P-I is the largest paper to go under in an economic climate where newspapers are facing a steep drop in advertising revenues and readership. At the same time, newspapers are also forced to compete with Web sites that republish news stories but do not share the costs of producing them. Last month, the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado, published its final edition after nearly 150 years. Last October, the Christian Science Monitor also announced that in 2009, it would replace its daily print edition with its Web site. It also offers subscribers weekly print and daily e-mail editions. P-I Publisher Roger Ogelsby said there was no way for the paper to survive in the current environment. See the final front page . ""It was a combination of time and really rotten economic conditions that caught up with us,"" Ogelsby said. The announcement came a little more than two months after Hearst Corp. which owns the paper, announced that it would either sell the P-I or close it. For months, the paper's staff prayed a buyer would come through while covering the city and the drama surrounding their own future. ""There's some relief in knowing,"" Managing Editor David McCumber said. ""And some excitement about SeattlePI.com. We'll be the first paper to go online only. So I am glad the globe will keep spinning on the roof and there will still be a P-I in Seattle even if it will be online only."" The Web site will solicit contributions from the community, link to other sites and continue to cover breaking news, McCumber said. iReport.com: Are you a newspaper person? ""We want to engage as many people in the community as possible with the Web site. It's going to be different, there's no question,"" he said. P-I staffers who lost their jobs and those who remained said that in its new form, the P-I will no longer be able to cover Seattle with the same depth and resources it once had.   Watch as staff puts out the final print edition » . ""I wrote about the port of Seattle. Looked at some of the ways the port was mismanaging public dollars,"" said investigative reporter Ruth Teichroeb, who lost her job after 11 years with the paper. ""I've looked at vulnerable adults who were being mistreated in group homes across the state. I have written about children at a state school for the deaf who were mistreated for decades. Those are the kinds of stories that the city is losing now."" The P-I's rival, the Seattle Times, will still publish a daily newspaper, but that paper also has been plagued with financial difficulties, prompting some Seattleites to worry that they may soon live in a no-newspaper town. Under a joint operating agreement, the Times and P-I shared production costs while remaining editorially independent. That competition was good for both papers, P-I columnist Mike Lewis said.  Watch more on the end of the final print edition » . ""You lose two things. You specifically lose all the stories the P-I might be doing, but you also lose a competitive news environment. It makes us a lot sharper, and it certainly has made them a lot sharper."" David Lonay, a subscriber since 1950, told CNN affiliate KIRO he'll miss the morning ritual of picking up the paper. ""The first thing I do every day is get the P-I and read it,"" Lonay said, according to KIRO. ""I really feel like an old friend is dying."" Sitting in a downtown cafe near the P-I, Jesse Stewart said he doesn't read either local paper because of the environmental issues involved with producing newspapers and the convenience factor of reading news online. ""I get to work and pull up my Google news. I guess I am part of the problem.""",0.54809237,2397
117,"Parkersburg, West Virginia (CNN) -- At nearly $12.1 trillion, the U.S. national debt has reached a size that is incomprehensible to most people and as intangible as the '""Big Bang"" or bipartisanship. But it is real in West Virginia, where a small, nearly anonymous group of government accountants calculate the public debt to the penny each day, living a mathematic nightmare and number cruncher's dream. At a large desk in Parkersburg, Jaime Saling watches over roughly 6,500 pieces of data and trillions of dollars each day. Her title takes up a few characters itself: Saling is the debt accounting branch manager for the Bureau of Public Debt. She and a division of just 15 people quietly and relentlessly work to account for every penny of the national debt. It is tedious and potentially overwhelming work, but Saling acts as if she flies jet fighters. ""I get very excited,"" the petite and energetic Saling says, ""They call me a nerd, several times; I think it's because I get very excited about all the work we do."" That work happens in a simple one-story, brick building in Parkersburg, some 300 miles from Washington. The public debt offices landed there thanks to heavyweight home-state Sen. Robert Byrd. The bureau's offices are tucked into a corner of town that's easy to miss. A brown hill and train track sit on one side, parking lots for county offices on the other. The locale is still a surprise to some. ""Every now and then we get a comment, 'Where are you? Parkersburg?'"" Saling says. The public debt building has become a number nerds' paradise. Employees say they balance their checkbooks at least weekly, some daily. A big happy-face sign marks progress on a recent audit. A written goal is taped to a Nerf-sized football. And the security guards brag that someone brings in a cake about every other day. Inside, Saling's office is pin-neat, but her computer screen is cramped. A full-screen photo of Saling's 4- and 5-year-old children is covered by dozens of icons for spreadsheets and documents, so that glimpses of bright blonde hair poke out from under a field of white data squares. ""I need to clean it out right now,"" Saling says with a shrug, then laughs. She then calls up the brain of the debt-management system, a software program called PARS, or Public debt Accounting and Reporting System. The acronym is a pun only an accountant would love. ""Par value"" means ""stated value"" in the field. PARS is a custom program, designed in the early '90s to check and double-check the constant buying and selling of U.S. debt. Thanks in part to the debt software, what used to take 100 people a month to compute now is done by 15 people in a day. Even so, the program looks like it's from another time, with a black screen and neon-colored letters that recall computer monitors of the ""War Games"" era. ""It is outdated,"" Saling says of the font. But she insists the program itself still operates well. Annual government reviews of PARS back that up. And the division overall has a remarkable record of 13 straight years of unqualified audits, the accounting gold standard of accuracy. That brings a massive smile to Saling's face; you see how someone so enthusiastic can be called a nerd. ""Things like that make me very excited."" (Her favorite report, by the way, is the ""schedules of public debt"".) Each day, to check the funds flowing in and out of the public debt, Saling types in five-digit codes into PARS and checks a slew of accounts. She knows about 50 of those codes by heart. In general, there is a scale to this work that would disrupt most minds. ""Most people don't have a sense of it until they come here and see it,"" said accounting director Mike Linder, who is Saling's boss. ""Most calculators don't handle what we do."" And almost no one sees the debt as they do. ""A lot of people, I don't think realize what the debt's made of,"" Saling put forth. ""In that $12 trillion you have both debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings."" In other words, the debt held by those outside the government and debt the government owes to itself, such as money borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund. At the end of November, $7.7 trillion was debt held by the public and $4.4 trillion was intragovernmental holdings. Saling sees a heartbeat in the numbers. ""It's actually helping us operate government."" And never has government been larger. But Saling and these accountants of the people are careful on that note. ""It's not that we're saying this is the right thing to do,"" she states matter-of-factly. ""A lot of times we're saying, 'If they pass this, how are we going to account for it?' A lot of times that takes a lot of meetings."" Saling is right, in the age of deficits and debt, all of that literally keeps government operating. Yet those trillions of dollars are overseen by a small division that works without contractors and is content with a software system that may look clunky, but which they insist works more than well. There is an irony here. These self-proclaimed nerds oversee the very symbol of big government but exude sobriety and restraint. Saling and her staff are nearly anonymous but deeply significant. And they are more than happy that way.",0.54550666,7157
118,"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chen Xiao had pretty much given up making her own decisions and so decided to throw open her life to the whims of China's hundreds of millions of Internet users, known in China as netizens. Beijing resident Chen Xiao decided to put her life up for sale after an unhappy 2008. ""It's your right to arrange Chen Xiao's life, and it's my obligation to serve you,"" read her online shop. Since December, Chen has been allowing others to decide what she will do each day, because, for the most part, last year was awful, she said. Her hometown was hit by blizzards, her country rocked by a devastating earthquake, friends divorced and her clothing shop went bankrupt. ""Every time I had a plan for what I wanted my life to be like, nothing would come of it. It was very disappointing. I figured if other people came up with things for me to do, I might stumble upon something new and better,"" she told CNN. What she stumbled upon was not only a new life but a new way to make a living. She charges about $3 an hour, and she's been asked to do almost everything from delivering pet food to caring for stray cats to taking a hot lunch to a homeless man. What surprised her the most was not so much the varied requests but being able to find happiness in the process. ""If somebody asks you to do something, something simple, and you do it, it can make you very happy. You can change from a gloomy person to a very bright one. It can help give you a new sense of self-esteem,"" she said. So far, the most meaningful assignment she was given was attending a child's birth -- the father was a complete stranger who just wanted someone to take pictures and share the moment. There are limits to what she will agree to do. She will not do anything illegal, immoral or violent, but she said that has not stopped some from asking. ""When I first started there was this man who would send me these really disgusting text messages. His words were over the top... nauseating,"" she said. There was also a man who wanted to meet her for a few private hours at a ski chalet. When she turned up with a friend to take photographs, he backed out and then demanded a refund, but Chen refused. In many ways she is just a glorified errand girl, but with a unique China twist. Chen is another example here of how in China the Internet is crossing over from cyberspace to the real world. Chen does not know how much longer she will keep taking cyberrequests. For now it is a good way to survive the financial crisis when many others are losing their jobs and businesses are going broke. ""When people stop needing me, I'll go back to my original life. But I don't know what will come,"" she said. China's netizens will most likely make that decision for her as well.",0.54532737,2778
119,"(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday called on the state bar to overlook a technical error and allow a paralyzed law school graduate to take the bar exam next week. Arnold Schwarzenegger says a technical error shouldn't stop the law school graduate from taking the bar exam. ""It is outrageous that someone who has overcome so much in life is penalized by a bureaucratic error that prevents her from taking the bar exam next week,"" the governor said in a statement. ""Government should work for the people, not against them, and I'm calling on the state bar to allow Sara Granda to take next week's test. Sara is a fighter, and I am with her all the way."" The state bar's Web site never processed Granda's application for Tuesday's test because California's Department of Rehabilitation paid her $600 fee with a check, according to the Sacramento Bee. The Web site requires a credit card number, but Granda said she was assured by a state bar representative that she was properly registered with the check, the newspaper reported. Granda, 29, a University of California-Davis Law School graduate, has petitioned the California Supreme Court to allow her to take Tuesday's test. She said she was ""surprised"" to hear about Schwarzenegger's statement in her defense. ""I'm not used to a lot of attention,"" she told CNN television affiliate KCRA. She said she went to the governor's office last week, ""but they wouldn't let me in."" ""So I knew there was no way that the governor was going to get involved,"" she said. Granda was paralyzed from the neck down after a car accident in 1997, when she was 17. The accident happened a month before she was to attend California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, on a full scholarship, according to the Sacramento Bee. Granda, who has been studying 11 hours a day for the bar exam with the help of assistants, said she wants the state of California to resolve the matter because it spent about $100,000 for her education.

120,"QUEENS, New York (CNN) -- For Victor Guevares, winning a bid at a raucous foreclosure auction two months ago was just the first step toward achieving his dream of home ownership. And after getting through several obstacles along the way, he finally moved his family into the two-story, three-bedroom house in Queens. Victor Guevares, second from right, bought a home at a raucous foreclosure auction two months ago. The auction process isn't as easy as it looks, Guevares said. ""If you're going to an auction, do your research,"" he told CNN. CNN first met the Guevares family in March when he grabbed a home once worth $527,000 for less than half that price. Guevares had won an auction at USHomeAuction.com's foreclosure sale in New York. Banks and other lenders were unloading foreclosed houses, and many were selling at 50 percent to 60 percent below their highest values. Foreclosures skyrocketed in March and the first quarter of 2009 to their highest levels on record as banks lifted moratoria on filings. Foreclosure filings -- which include default papers, auction sale notices and repossessions -- reached 803,489 in the first quarter, according to a recent report by RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed properties.  Watch Victor Guevares give a quick tour of his new home » . That is a 24 percent jump over a year earlier and a 9 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Of those first-quarter filings, 341,180 happened in March, a 17 percent increase from February and a 46 percent jump from March 2008. Sitting with his stomach in knots on that March 8 afternoon, Guevares made the opening bid and kept pace until they passed $100,000, then $200,000. Looking shell-shocked, Guevares ended up with the winning bid: $230,000. But he soon realized there was much more to it, after plunking down $7,000 in auction fees and another $5,000 required from every bidder. And still, he couldn't immediately lock in a mortgage at the auction as he had hoped because records showed the home faced a possible code violation. ""I had a problem,"" Guevares said. An inspection cleared that hurdle, and closing day ended happily with Guevares holding the deed to his first house. But he wasn't through yet. Guevares, a married father of two, wanted to have his family moved in by the end of May -- and had his work cut out, since the home was split into two apartments. He broke down a wall, opened up a staircase, put in new floors, repainted and created a sunroom. All that work brought his cost to roughly $280,000 -- about $20,000 less than the estimated value of the home, he said. Guevares spent the past 12 years renting and trying to save for his first home, and believes he came out ahead with the auction win. ""I got a great deal on the house. My mortgage is $300 less than what I paid in rent,"" he said. The backyard is filled with garbage bags filled with debris, but the family was able to move in last week. Guevares' son, 8-year-old Devin, is reveling in his bright green room that has a window to peek out into his yard -- and the neighbor's. ""They have a dog named Rocky, just the same as the dog we have,"" he said. Another perk: no more worrying about being quiet as he did at their apartment. ""I can just scream,"" said Devin.",0.54324174,5147
121,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In a tough job market, MBA graduates seeking top-tier jobs are turning to a career networking site created by and catering to young professionals. Doostang gets its name from the Latin for ""reaching for talent."" Doostang is an online community that seeks to match the brightest new grads with what it says are the crème de la crème of positions in finance, consulting and tech. Exclusivity is the cornerstone of this network, which connects graduates from elite schools with top employers. The site offers its members access to selective jobs that are not really available on the open market, according to founder Mareza Larizadeh. It's able to do that because recruiting managers are drawn by the caliber of its members, which includes students from the top business schools, he says. Schools like The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Duke University's Fuqua School of Business have formed partnerships with Doostang that enable their students to access the network's premium job listings for free. ""Our goal is to get great jobs in front of relevant people and relevant candidates in front of hiring managers,"" Larizadeh tells CNN. Larizadeh never intended to launch a career start-up. He was completing his MBA at Stanford University in 2005 when he got the idea for Doostang, which is a modified version of ""reaching for talent"" in Latin. Classmates were exchanging emails about career advice, and ""I thought, why don't we give this some structure?"" he recalls. Four years and a round of venture capital funding later, what started as a hobby designed to help friends share career information has turned into a network with approximately 600,000 members. Larizadeh estimates that roughly a dozen of the top 20 MBA programs have signed partnership deals with Doostang. While mostly U.S. focused, Doostang is also becoming more international and recently sealed a deal to provide job opportunities to INSEAD. In an age where social networking sites abound, Doostang sets itself apart by taking closely knit relationships developed offline in B-school and leveraging them online to make a better job searching experience, Larizadeh says. A member applying for a job at McKinsey, for instance, is able to connect with members of his or her Doostang network that may have a McKinsey link to gain an insider's perspective. Larizadeh believes it isn't just the quality of people and jobs that distinguishes Doostang from other careers sites like LinkedIn and executive search service The Ladders. Doostang is also distinctive in that it caters specifically to students in their 20s and 30s with most of the positions advertised geared towards people at the beginning or middle of their careers. Employers advertising positions on the site range from white shoe firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to Silicon Valley titans Google and Facebook. Users initially had to be invited to join the network, but now Doostang is open to everyone. Members, however, have to pay for access to the most exclusive job postings. This helps keep the membership selective, Larizadeh said. Generally, people won't pay for membership if they aren't qualified for the jobs being advertised, he explained. The fee for premium services, which gives access to the more exclusive job postings, ranges from $25 to $40 a month. The site, which has always featured jobs at hedge funds, private equity firms and investment banks prominently, experienced a surge when the financial crisis kicked off last fall. ""Even though the economy is not as bad as it used to be, we are still seeing a good uptake. Our traffic is still going strong,"" Larizadeh says.",0.54228437,7502
122,"ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN) -- When Lisa Brown moved into her rental house on Long Island last summer with her three daughters, she says, it felt like a new beginning. Lisa Brown has to move out of her rental house because it is facing foreclosure . After living in apartments, the spacious house got her attention immediately. ""It was bigger than what I had lived in,"" she says. Brown was also won over by the neighborhood with its tidy homes and good school district. ""I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district."" But they hardly had a chance. Instead, fighting back tears, she says, ""I have to get out."" Brown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure. The house was recently sold at auction. The bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had 30 days to vacate. ""I was hysterical, I was like, what do you mean?"" Watch Lisa Brown's talk about why she has to move »  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure.  As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the rent was going toward the mortgage. ""I didn't see there was a problem,"" she said. ""You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage, I didn't see the problem."" Unfortunately, Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard. According to the Center for Housing Policy, nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal.   In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what's going on, renters are usually kept in the dark. New York State Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. ""In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,"" he says. Klein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York, and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go. Similar laws are already in place in Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Maryland, Rhode Island, Michigan and California. ""What we're facing here"", Klein says, ""is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it."" Brown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it. ""She knew that this house was foreclosing on her. She did nothing about it. Nothing, except take my money."" Brown was paying $1,900 a month in rent. She had also paid $5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house. She says that money is gone. ""She will not give me my deposit back. Nothing."" CNN tried to reach the owner, who lives upstairs, for comment, but her phone was disconnected, and no one answered the door. The broker who rented her the house and who was paid $1,900 says he did not know the house was in foreclosure. He also says the brokerage fee will not be returned. ""It took everything I had to move in,"" Brown says, ""to give my kids a better environment."" And now, ""I'm left out with nothing."" Because eviction papers trump the lease, Brown has no legal right to stay. The bank that foreclosed on the house, and now owns it, offered her $1,000 to get out, but she says she's lost close to $6,000 and has nowhere to go. ""If it was me, yeah I could move out and go on my own. But it's my family you're talking about, my children, my three daughters and my pets, that I brought in here thinking that we were going to stay and be happy."" Brown is considering suing the owner in small-claims court to get her money back and cover moving expenses. For now, though, she says she will adjust her dreams and find another place for her family to live.",0.5390102,2077
123,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Millard Fuller, who founded Habitat for Humanity International along with his wife, has died, officials said Tuesday. He was 74. Millard Fuller appears with President Bush at a Habitat for Humanity event in Tampa, Florida, in 2001. Fuller died early Tuesday ""after a brief illness,"" said a statement on the Web site of the organization he currently headed, Fuller Center for Housing, in Americus, Georgia. ""Family and friends are mourning the tragic loss of a great servant leader and a genuine heart,"" the statement said. Fuller had suffered from chest congestion for three to four weeks, said Holly Chapman, spokeswoman for the Fuller Center. He died about 3 a.m. en route to a hospital, she said. With his wife, Linda, Fuller founded Habitat for Humanity International in 1976. The Alabama native rose ""from humble beginnings"" to become a ""young, self-made millionaire,"" according to his biography on Habitat for Humanity's Web site. He and a college friend began a marketing firm while still in school, ""but as his business prospered, his health, integrity and marriage suffered,"" the biography said. ""These crises prompted Fuller to re-evaluate his values and direction. His soul-searching led to reconciliation with his wife and to a renewal of his Christian commitment,"" it said. The Fullers sold all their possessions, gave money to the poor and began searching for a new direction. They found Koinonia Farm, a Christian community near Americus in rural southwest Georgia, the biography said. Along with Koinonia founder Clarence Jordan and a few others, the couple initiated several enterprises, among them a housing ministry that built modest homes on a no-interest, nonprofit basis and made them affordable to low-income families. Homeowner families were expected to use their own labor to help defray costs on their home as well as homes for other families. Money to build homes was placed into a revolving fund, enabling more to be built, according to the biography. In 1973, the Fullers moved to Africa to test their housing model, the biography said. Their project was launched in Zaire -- now the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- and was a success. ""Fuller became convinced that this model could be expanded and applied all over the world,"" the biography said. When Fuller returned to the United States three years later, he met with a group of associates to create Habitat for Humanity International. According to its Web site, Habitat has provided shelter for more than 1.5 million people in more than 3,000 communities. ""I see life as both a gift and a responsibility. My responsibility is to use what God has given me to help his people in need,"" Fuller once said, according to Habitat's Web site. Former President Carter, a key Habitat supporter, fellow Georgian and a close friend, issued a statement Tuesday saying Fuller ""was one of the most extraordinary people I have ever known."" ""He used his remarkable gifts as an entrepreneur for the benefit of millions of needy people around the world by providing them with decent housing,"" Carter said. ""As the founder of Habitat for Humanity and later the Fuller Center, he was an inspiration to me, other members of our family and an untold number of volunteers who worked side-by-side under his leadership.""  See celebrities working on Habitat projects » . In 1996, President Clinton awarded Fuller the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, calling Habitat ""the most successful continuous community service project in the history of the United States."" Fuller left Habitat for Humanity in 2005 amid a dispute with the organization's board. Habitat said in a statement at the time his termination culminated ""several months of differences between the Fullers and the board over allegations of inappropriate personal behavior of Millard Fuller toward a now-former female employee,"" according to an article in the February 2005 edition of Christianity Today magazine. The organization noted there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the complaint, according to Christianity Today, but said Fuller engaged in ""a pattern of ongoing public comments and communications ... that have been divisive and disruptive to the organization's work."" For his part, Fuller told the magazine he feared the board used the controversy to push him out to find a ""high-paid bean counter"" instead of someone with ""strong Christian commitment."" ""We've overloaded the board with 'money' people, all of whom are nominal Christians, but many of whom are not spiritually grounded,"" he told the magazine. ""Some seem put off by my overt declaration of Jesus.""

124,"NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Is cheese the answer for Cayuga County, New York? Larry Rosenbaum surveys the field where he hopes to build a high-end specialty cheese factory. Like small towns all across America, this agricultural community is suffering, with unemployment approaching 10 percent. Entrepreneur Larry Rosenbaum thinks he can do his part to turn things around. For a decade, the insurance man by trade has been dreaming of building a factory for high-end specialty cheese. One key selling point: His product would meet the strictest standards of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Rosenbaum says the demand for kosher and halal cheese is high but the selection is slim. So he's been eyeing a plot of barren farmland between Aurelius and Auburn -- two Cayuga towns -- as the future home of a $40 million, 64,000-square-foot factory that would churn out feta and brie. The goal is for his company, Saratoga Cheese Corp., to produce 30 million pounds of cheese in the first year and distribute it domestically and internationally. ""It's the beginning of a trend of bringing back manufacturing industry to New York,"" said Rosenbaum. According to the Public Policy Institute of New York State, manufacturing in New York declined more than 30 percent between 1997 and 2007.  Watch Rosenbaum talk about his plans » . Rosenbaum estimates that Saratoga Cheese Corp. would bring 75 factory jobs and 150 temporary construction jobs to the region. Plans also include 50 yeshiva work-study students to be placed on participating farms. In addition, several rabbis and imams would supervise production. If Saratoga Cheese can get off the ground, it could mean a boost for local farmers like Dale Hemminger, who has agreed to supply kosher milk to Saratoga Cheese Corp. Hemminger says it could be a crucial new market for his milk. And though he was at first skeptical of Rosenbaum's plan, Hemminger says he admires Rosenbaum's vision. But that vision is still $10 million short of becoming reality. Rosenbaum has secured $30 million in government grants, loans and private funding, but needs $40 million before Saratoga Cheese Corp. can break ground. Given the recession, securing the final amount is proving no small feat. According to Bill Teator, a board member of Saratoga Cheese Corp., the best-case scenario is a combination of investment by a kosher dairy company and private lending. Teator says that though investors are confident about the business plan, the economic environment makes it tough to secure the needed cash. But support from local lawmakers is abundant. Republican state Sen. Michael Nozzolio is optimistic that Saratoga Cheese Corp. will find a home in his 54th District. And with an estimated $140 million in local revenue hanging in the balance, there's reason to hope. Recession or not, Rosenbaum is steadfast in his belief. For him, it's not a question of if the factory will get built, but when. ""We're not going to quit until we make it,"" says Rosenbaum. It's a persistence that is necessary in a recession that has proved legendary.",0.5370029,2757
125,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. ""It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,"" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. ""There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward. Even if you look at coming over here during our enslavement, we were brought here to cultivate the land because that's something we did on the continent. So really, that's what many of the people are doing now,"" he said. Myers believes urban farming is a way for many African-Americans to reconnect with their past. iReport.com: Show us your urban farm . ""They are going through a process of Sankofa and going to what they traditionally did, which is connect to the Earth so they can move forward and grow,"" he says. But HABESHA Gardens isn't unique. Former pro basketball player Will Allen, who is considered to be one of the nation's leading urban farmers and founder of Growing Power Inc., estimates that there are hundreds of thousands of urban gardens in inner cities across America.  Urban farms help feed people, sustain neighorhoods »  ""It's beyond a movement at this point. Its more like a revolution,"" says Allen. Both Allen and Myers agree that the boom in urban farming for African-Americans is born out of necessity and not just echoing traditions. ""Minority people are affected by poor food, more than any other groups,"" and many inner cities lack access to quality fruits and vegetables, Allen says. ""Our food system is broken."" ""When you're poor, when you don't have access to resources, you have to create your own,"" says Myers. ""So this is a way for people of African descent to use their creativity to grow their own food."" Many poorer communities don't have full-scale grocery stores. Allen charges that companies have red-lined those areas and won't build stores there. So community activists like Myers have taken up the fight. ""[Starting] community gardens in local communities, specifically in urban areas, is important, so you create your own food security network,"" says Myers. ""You're not relying on large grocery stores to provide food for everyone because if those grocery stores have problems, your access to food is done."" HABESHA Gardens makes the fresh food accessible to people in Mechanicsville by opening up the garden to people in the community every Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. ""We invite people from the local community here, the immediate community but also from the greater Atlanta community ... to come out, work in the garden; learn, reconnect with the Earth and also be able to take food home with them after the harvest."" In addition to providing food for those that work in garden, HABESHA partners with organizations such as the Atlanta Community Food Bank and the MLK Senior Center to provide food from the garden to the hungry and elders in the community. HABESHA is more than just an urban garden. HABESHA, an acronym for Helping Africa By Establishing Schools at Home and Abroad. The organization mentors young African-Americans by sending them on a yearly trip to Ghana and educates the youth in Mechanicsville through the garden's after-school program called Sustainable Seeds. ""Not only are we teaching them about agriculture, [we're] teaching them about solar technology, rainwater catching,"" Myers says. ""A majority of the food that was planted here was done by the youth in the after-school program. They helped to build the shed, they helped to build the greenhouse, they helped to build the shade nursery ... They are very much a vital part of the process that goes on here."" Malik Parks, 12, is a member of HABESHA's mentoring program. ""Well, it feeds us. That's a big thing -- to know that we're helping the earth. Us planting it, that gives us exercise; then also, eating it gives us nutrients,"" says Parks. Sporting a ""Black to Our Roots"" T-shirt, Parks is already well aware of the higher purpose he and HABESHA have with their garden. ""I believe to some, its hope. I know there are a lot of people over here that live in poverty. I know you can come and pick food, so that's food for them,"" Parks says. ""So it's hope to stay alive longer and be energized and do what you have to do to get back on your feet."" Myers, who is his mentor, agrees. ""We encourage the people in the community to come, be a part of the process of growing the food, so it's more empowerment than it is giving as charity,"" says Myers. And with urban farms like Will Allen's becoming half-million dollar enterprises in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, and many other farms in New York City and Detroit, Michigan, urban gardening is spreading like the roots of the vegetables they grow. ""This has become a multicultural, multigenerational movement, a revolution,"" says Allen. ""This isn't just the hippies and tree huggers. Everyone is getting on board. It's really exciting.""",0.53561836,4979
126,"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- An outraged sheriff in Illinois who refuses to evict ""innocent"" renters from foreclosed homes criticized mortgage companies Thursday and said the law should protect victims of the mortgage meltdown. Cook County, Illinois, Sheriff Thomas J. Dart says too many renters are being evicted for landlords' problems. Sheriff Thomas J. Dart said earlier he is suspending foreclosure evictions in Cook County, which includes the city of Chicago. The county had been on track to reach a record number of evictions, many because of mortgage foreclosures. Many good tenants are suffering because building owners have fallen behind on their mortgage payments, he said Thursday on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""These poor people are seeing everything they own put out on the street. ... They've paid their bills, paid them on time. Here we are with a battering ram at the front door going to throw them out. It's gotten insane,"" he said.  Watch Dart slam mortgage companies » . Mortgage companies are supposed to identify a building's occupants before asking for an eviction, but sheriff's deputies routinely find that the mortgage companies have not done so, Dart said. ""This is an example where the banking industry has not done any of the work they should do. It's a piece of paper to them,"" Dart said. ""These mortgage companies ... don't care who's in the building,"" Dart said Wednesday. ""They simply want their money and don't care who gets hurt along the way. ""On top of it all, they want taxpayers to fund their investigative work for them. We're not going to do their jobs for them anymore. We're just not going to evict innocent tenants. It stops today."" Dart said he wants the courts or the state Legislature to establish protections for those most harmed by the mortgage crisis. In 1999, Cook County had 12,935 mortgage foreclosure cases; in 2006, 18,916 cases were filed, and last year, 32,269 were filed. This year's total is expected to exceed 43,000. ""The people we're interacting with are, many times, oblivious to the financial straits their landlord might be in,"" Dart said. ""They are the innocent victims here, and they are the ones all of us must step up and find some way to protect.""  Watch sheriff announce he won't evict innocent tenants » . The Illinois Bankers Association opposed the plan, saying that Dart ""was elected to uphold the law and to fulfill the legal duties of his office, which include serving eviction notices."" The association said Dart could be found in contempt of court for ignoring court eviction orders. ""The reality is that by ignoring the law and his legal responsibilities, he is carrying out 'vigilantism' at the highest level of an elected official,"" it said. ""The Illinois banking industry is working hard to help troubled homeowners in many ways, but Sheriff Dart's declaration of 'martial law' should not be tolerated."" Dart was undeterred Thursday. ""I think the outrage on my part with them [is] that they could so cavalierly issue documents and have me throw people out of homes who have done absolutely nothing wrong,"" Dart said.

Mustang Barbers is an old-fashioned barber shop. Men come from all walks of life to get their haircuts from one of Mustang's 10 barbers. While some men wait their turn in the barber's chair, they get a shoeshine and read the morning newspaper. The old saying ""the more things change, the more things stay the same"" couldn't be more true at Mustang Barbers. The shop has been around this Dallas neighborhood for 40 years. Its owner, Phil McAllister, has been cutting hair for more than 35 years. He comes from a family of barbers. His father, A.E. McAllister, was a barber for 61 years and worked at Mustang Barbers into his 90s. Phil's son, Wes McAllister, 28, also works there.

Ed McMahon: It's a combination, it's like a perfect storm. Economy problems. Selling the house right now is a tremendous operation .... We've had this house on the market for two years. We've shown it, I don't know how many, 50 organizations or people. Nobody has made an offer. I mean, it's just a lovely home. I hate to leave it. I want to keep the home.

If you're a millionaire, shouldn't you be able to pay $644,000?

130,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- During the current economic crisis, high-flying women have been overlooked for promotion, according to a study out Tuesday. At the upper level of management, business is still dominated by men. The study, by U.S. nonprofit research group Catalyst, surveyed 873 MBA alumni who graduated between 1996 and 2007, asking how their careers had fared between November 2007 and June 2009. The results showed that overall, male and female MBAs have proved resilient to the recession and have fared equally well in the U.S., Canada and Asia, with 31 percent of surveyed women reporting that they had been promoted during that time period, compared to 36 percent of men. However in Europe, just 26 per cent of women were promoted, compared with 44 percent of men, according to the study published in the Harvard Business Review. According to the Harvard Business Review, of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies only two per cent of the CEOs are women, and only 15 per cent of the seats on their boards of directors are held by women. Professor Susan Vinnicombe is the director of the Center for International Women Business Leaders at Cranfield University School of Management in England. She told CNN that while it isn't clear why the figures for Europe in particular show such a gender discrepancy, it reflects discrimination faced by women business leaders in general. Read more business related features . ""There is a whole stream of research of male and female MBAs that systematically shows the more senior they get the bigger the disparities in salaries and promotion,"" she said. ""Immediately after the MBA -- at the mid level -- women do quite well, but as they progress upwards the disparities emerge and get wider. That's not just for MBAs, it's the function of men and women in the workforce in general."" When it comes to the top tier, women worldwide were much more likely than men to lose their jobs, with 19 percent of female senior executives losing their jobs, compared with six per cent of men. Eleanor Tabi Haller-Jorden, General Manager of Catalyst Europe told CNN that the discrepancy is probably not the result of the current economic malaise. ""These figures reflect what has been a challenge in Europe for a number years,"" she said. ""The talent pipeline in Europe is clearly not as robust for women. This study indicates that by and large this is not directly related to the economic crisis, but it may have magnified the discrepancy."" Haller-Jorden cites European corporate culture, perpetuation of gender-based stereotypes, exclusion of women from informal networks and a lack of role models as reasons behind the discrepancy. Cranfield University produces what it calls the ""Female FTSE Index,"" showing the percentage of female directors in Britain's top 100 companies. Vinnicombe says that in the last 10 years the number of female directors has hardly improved, increasing from seven per cent to just 11 percent. Vinnicombe adds that she has found anecdotal evidence that a number of senior women in the British banking sector have chosen to leave their jobs, rather than work in a ""high pressure, highly controlling"" work environment brought about by the economic crisis. The Catalyst study also shows that many MBAs aren't letting the economic crisis get in the way of career advancement. Overall, 34 percent of respondents had received a promotion and 35 percent made a lateral move. ""The data almost indicates business as usual, in highly unusual times for business,"" Haller-Jorden told CNN. The common perception might be that given the current economic uncertainty, employees would choose to play it safe rather than chance their luck in a volatile job market, but the study found that MBAs have been willing to risk career moves, with 20 percent of respondents changing jobs, 14 percent relocating and four percent starting their own business. Haller-Jorden said that MBAs represent ""high-potential employees"" who tend to be entrepreneurial and show a high level of initiative. She added that these individuals tend to be opportunistic when it comes to their careers, seeking out new developmental opportunities, exploring lateral moves, looking at options around relocating, and choosing other employment opportunities to make sure they aren't negatively impacted by recession. ""The results are sobering for a corporate sector which may have assumed that people would be grateful to have a job and wouldn't necessarily be exploring other options,"" she said. ""For companies to rest on their laurels and assume they don't need to worry about retention is a mistake.""",0.531417,6812

133,"(LifeWire) -- The TV no longer sits on a moving box, but she's still using filing cabinets as end tables. Desiree Jacobsen graduated from college years ago, so why does her apartment resemble a dorm room? It's hard to save for the finer things when you've had to shell out money to be in five weddings in one year, three times as maid of honor. Some maids of honor have gone deep into debt rather than disappoint a friend who expects a lot. ""I shop at the Salvation Army quite a bit to save money,"" says Jacobsen, 26, a medical editor in Dallas. Being a bride's maid or matron of honor is a distinction many women cherish. But it doesn't come cheap. It can easily cost a woman $1,000 or more for the honor of standing beside the bride on her big day, according to TheKnot.com, the leading wedding Web site. On top of the traditional expenses of wedding attire, transportation and chipping in for a gift from the bridesmaids, maids of honor can wind up hosting bridal showers, bachelorette parties and even the co-ed Jack and Jill party -- often footing the bill entirely. Expectations are reaching bridezilla proportions, a trend Anna Post, spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute and great-great-granddaughter of the etiquette authority, attributes in part to the extensive coverage of celebrity weddings on television and in style magazines.  Watch etiquette tips on attending wedding events » . Many bridesmaids are left torn between maintaining a friendship and breaking the bank. Tough to say no . When Sarah de Maintenon, a 33-year-old real estate agent in Syracuse, New York, agreed to be her best friend's maid of honor two years ago, the economy was good and houses were selling like hot cakes. But the currently slow real-estate market means that money has become tight as the big day -- scheduled for October -- slowly approaches. ""I seriously just didn't know. I thought it was just a bachelorette party,"" says de Maintenon of the events she was expected to throw and attend. Her distress over the destination wedding sent her seeking advice online. The advice she received was simple, but effective: Talk to her friend and be honest about her situation. ""I contemplated telling her I couldn't do it, but I couldn't break her heart,"" she says. ""I was afraid it would cause an argument ... I didn't want to ruin her wedding day."" Jacobsen hasn't skipped a wedding, but she did once skip the pre-wedding bridal portrait, which she would have had to travel out of town to participate in, because she was short on money and vacation time. ""She was upset with me for a little while, but it quickly blew over because I started planning for her bachelorette party."" When feelings get hurt, Jacobsen says, she tries not to take it personally. ""It's usually because of the stress of the wedding."" Etiquette rules vs. reality . Is all this necessary? Are brides asking too much of their friends? Post says that contrary to popular belief, the bridal shower isn't the maid of honor's obligation. Traditionally, a close friend would throw a bridal shower for the bride, and sometimes that person is also the maid of honor. But expenses can be agreed upon in advance and shared by the entire wedding party. And though there may be multiple parties thrown for the happy couple, Post says, the maid of honor is not required to go. ""That's not true,"" claims Kim Bohnert, a 32-year-old teacher in San Francisco. She's served nine stints as maid of honor and considers herself an expert bridesmaid. She insists that the entire bridal party -- especially the maid of honor -- is expected to attend all parties and shell out for a gift each time. ""It definitely adds up,"" says Melissa Bauer, spokesperson for TheKnot.com. Bauer ticks off some of the major expenses: about $300 for a dress, $50 to $200 for shoes, $40 to $60 for accessories, $50 for a shower gift and another $100 for a wedding gift. Then there are the parties. ""The big thing now is destination bachelorette parties,"" Bauer says. ""Some people might do it local, but regardless, you're [often] footing the cost for the bride [to attend]."" The cost of traveling to an out-of-town party can add several hundred dollars to the tab, Bauer notes -- to say nothing of the cost of traveling to the wedding itself. Going for broke . Whether popular wisdom requires such a commitment or not, there's a very real limit to what women can afford. Bohnert agreed to be her cousin's maid of honor, even though she was maxed out on her credit cards, and the many expenses included a $500 Sae Young Vu dress. ""I'm still in debt because of it,"" she says. Ma'ayan Geller, a part-time student and assistant physical therapist in San Francisco, was glad to hear her friend wanted to be sensitive to the financial constraints of her wedding party. But when Geller, one of the bridesmaids, suggested a cheap Las Vegas package for the bachelorette party, the bride gave her the boot, saying she wasn't being serious enough about her commitment to the wedding. ""I had already bought the dress -- close to $300 -- which was a lot for me at the time,"" Geller, 23, remembers. ""I think it could have been done in a better way."" Geller still attended the wedding, partially because all her friends were there and also because she wanted to support the bride, ""although the friendship kind of ended after that."" Making it work . In Post's experience, a wedding is a collaboration, and the wedding party often tries to find a solution that works for everyone. ""When something difficult arises, I've seen brides put on the brakes rather than force something on someone,"" she says. Jeri Kadison, a bridal coach in New York, says communication is key: Detail expectations early, and if something sounds too expensive, compromise and brainstorm other ideas, she advises. ""It's the bride's responsibility to be compassionate and considerate,"" she says. That strategy worked for de Maintenon. She and her bride talk almost every day. Instead of renting a restaurant, they're having a barbeque. Instead of renting a beach house, they're all staying with a girlfriend. It's also OK to say no, Post says. ""You can decline. Just do it early."" De Maintenon recently declined when one of her best friends asked her to be the maid of honor, and her friend wasn't upset.

134,"(CNN) -- In an attempt to be frugal amid the economic downturn, Karl Stetson and his family in Seattle, Washington, planned to skip their annual trip to Hawaii. Water rushes toward the shore at Sandy Beach Park in Honolulu, Hawaii. That is until Stetson began noticing airfare and hotel rates plunge this year. Last week, he caved, purchasing plane tickets for less than $450 a person, a sweet deal compared with $600 last year. He booked rooms at Hanalei Colony Resort, among the emerald mountains in Kauai, for 25 percent off, and he was delighted to receive one of the nights free. ""We might have done something on the mainland, something more low-key, but the fact that it was inexpensive was a big factor for us to go again,"" said Stetson, who is taking his wife and two young boys in May. Outdoor enthusiasts, lovebirds and families prudently resisting the urge to visit Hawaii, say aloha to majorly discounted airfares and hotel rates -- many hitting rock-bottom prices -- this year. The bittersweet theory seems to hold true: What is bad for the travel industry has been good for consumers. As Hawaii suffers from its biggest visitor decline since the Great Depression, the state is enticing travelers with discounted deals to offset the toll on its local economy. iReport.com: Toughing out the recession? Airfare to Hawaii from cities in the continental United States has plummeted more than 30 percent in some markets, according to FareCompare.com, an airfare research Web site. Pleasant Holidays, one of the nation's largest privately owned travel companies, is offering vacation packages that include flight and three nights hotel stay in Oahu starting at $299. Online travel giants Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz are all offering sales on Hawaii flights, hotels and activities, and some luxury hotels have rooms for less than $150 a night. ""You won't see prices to Hawaii like this again in your lifetime,"" FareCompare CEO Rick Seaney said. ""It might be worth it to take that once-in-a-lifetime trip."" For decades, tourists from the United States and abroad have flocked to Hawaii, many captivated by the exotic islands' natural beauty: snow-capped mountains, active volcanoes, breathtaking waterfalls and pristine beaches. Now with the administration of President Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Hawaii, there is a renewed interest for tourists to visit, travel experts say. But travelers have long viewed Hawaii as an expensive destination in comparison with Florida or California. Two adults can expect to spend $673 a day in Honolulu on food and lodging, making Hawaii the most expensive destination in the country, according to the AAA's 2008 Annual Vacation Costs Survey. It is no surprise, then, that in a brutal economy where consumer confidence is low, the islands are having a tough time reeling in visitors, despite discounted prices. The state reported a 12.4 percent decline in visitors, or 72,255 fewer guests, in January compared with the same time last year. The drop, which started last spring, is a reversal of nearly a decade of visitor growth. To make matters worse, visitor spending in Hawaii declined by 13.6 percent in January, and many state officials and experts are worried what that will mean for a state where tourism is the backbone industry. Nationwide, the tourism picture looks bleak, as the number of travelers is expected to fall throughout 2009, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. In the Aloha State, the smaller, more remote islands like Lana'i and Moloka'i are feeling the most pain. They received about a third fewer visitors in January than the year before. ""This is a downturn,"" said Mark B. Dunkerley, who sits on the board of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii and is CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. Dunkerley explained that the decline in visitors may be troubling, but the numbers are still as strong as they were a decade ago. ""It's not a catastrophe. The clock has been wound back."" Signs of decline for Hawaii began last spring with the shutdown of Aloha and ATA Airlines, which held about a fifth of the market share. By the summer, fuel prices had skyrocketed to $135 a barrel, which drove fares to an unaffordable price point for many travelers. That same year, NCL Corp.'s Norwegian Cruise Lines pulled back stops to Hawaii. Rob Pacheco, the president of Hawaii Forest & Trail, said he noticed about 3,000 fewer customers after some of the cruise ships stopped coming. The company, which gives natural tours of the island, said things ""just kind of deteriorated, and it was more difficult to fill seats."" Another challenge Hawaii faces in terms of tourism is its remote location on an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. This makes the state's tourism industry highly dependent on airfare prices. iReport.com: Where's your favorite secret hideaway? Traditionally, economical travelers shy away from Hawaii because of the high flight cost, travel experts said. But the airfare prices being offered until June show that prices may be more affordable than most leisure travelers think. A flight from Boston, Massachusetts, on Delta, United or American Airlines is running about $461 round trip, down from $610 at the same time last year, according to FareCompare.com. Travelers from major West Coast cities such as Los Angeles, California, can find flights just under $340, nearly 30 percent off the ticket price from a year ago, the site reported. Adding to the vacation savings are hotels, including lavish resorts, advertising rates about 20 percent lower in the first quarter of 2009 compared with first-quarter 2008, according to online travel companies. Hotels scrambled to offer lower rates when they saw occupancy numbers dive for the first time in years. Hotels say that in addition to the discount on the rooms, there are perks and added value such as upgrades, free nights and dinner coupons, travel experts say. For example, Outrigger Hotels and Resorts, owned by Outrigger Enterprises Group, is offering the third night free for travelers who book a stay in Waikiki this month for $159 a night. A year ago, the lowest the rate at the hotel was nearly $100 more. ""You can travel better than you have in the past for the same amount of money,"" said Ian Jeffries, an Expedia travel expert. ""Or you could do the exact same thing as last year and save money."" Travelers can also snatch bargains at condos and rental properties. This is particularly true on the islands of Maui and Oahu, where there has been major development in recent years, says Pauline Frommer, creator of the Pauline Frommer Guidebooks. ""You can play 'let's make a deal' with these folks,"" said Frommer, who has been tracking the travel industry for almost 20 years. ""They are desperate for people's business."" But don't expect the deals to paradise to last forever. Prices will climb during peak summer season and as soon as the economy recovers. Though experts are unsure when recovery will happen, Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism predicts that won't be until 2011. In the meantime, Hawaii tourism groups want to change American and international travelers' impression that a trip there is too expensive. With Japan suffering from its own economic woes, arrivals of Japanese tourists, once a steady revenue stream, have slowed, travel experts said. ""The difficulty is the fact that it's not a Hawaii-centered problem,"" said John Monahan, president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. ""We have a nationwide and global crisis.""",0.5271032,2031
135,"HOLLYWOOD, Florida (CNN) -- The slot machines are ringing, music is blasting at the crowded poolside bar, and people are dancing to celebrity DJs at hip nightclubs. But this is not a scene on the Las Vegas strip. This action is taking place on an Indian reservation. Richard Bowers Jr. says the Native American Group is intended to help tribes with basic needs. Business at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, is booming and contributing to the Seminole Indian Tribe's great wealth. Now the Seminoles are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before: organizing Native American tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across Indian Country. ""Some of these reservations I have been to -- it's like the Third World right here in the United States,"" says Richard Bowers Jr. As president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida Inc., Bowers has oversight over all the Hard Rock cafés, hotels and casinos in the world except the café in London and the casino in Las Vegas. The Seminole Tribe purchased the Hard Rock properties in 2007 for a reported $965 million. Bowers, a former alligator wrester and cattle rancher, is thankful for his tribe's success and has used his influence to create a consortium of Native American Tribes called the Native American Group. The goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the United States and Canada together in an effort to promote Native American-owned businesses and services. Keeping the dollar within Indian Country, Bowers hopes, will help the less fortunate tribes with basic needs such as housing, food and education. ""I view this as historic in nature,"" says Donald Laverdure, the chief legal counsel from Montana's Crow Tribe. ""We haven't had first-nation to first-nation actually occur, and now with the success of the Seminoles and others, they have an opportunity to help tribes such as ourselves."" The help that the Crow Nation seeks is financial. For the Crow Tribe, gaming is not an option, according to Laverdure. ""There's less population, so the success in gaming cannot be paralleled as elsewhere,"" he says. ""So we've always viewed our future in energy."" That energy would come from coal. The Crow Tribe wants to mine some of the 9 billion tons of coal that it estimates is on its land. Crow Nation Chairman Cedric Black Eagle hopes the success of his tribe will lie in turning coal into liquid diesel. ""It will open the door for Indian Country in energy fields and help this country start veering away from its dependence on foreign oil,"" he says. As the group meets to discuss coal, Bowers recalls that it was the need for beef that prompted his idea for the Native American Group. ""Here we have all these cafes, casinos -- everybody eats a hamburger,"" says Bowers. ""And than (I) realized that we don't have enough beef to supply our own needs, and that's when I reached out to other Native Americans that did have cattle."" Bowers discovered there are more than 2 million heads of cattle on Indian land. If there is not enough cattle on Indian land, then members of the group are encouraged to keep the business in the country and buy American. The Native American Group has come a long way since Bowers was looking for cattle. The group now has more than 100 tribal members and more than 100 Native-owned businesses. One successful business that joined the group is the largest Native American-owned contractor, Flintco. Robin Flint Ballenger, who is Cherokee, is its chairman of the board. ""It wasn't a far stretch for me at all to take a risk on this new organization because we are successful, we're doing very well,"" says Ballenger, who adds that a third of the company's work is done for Native America. One of the projects Flintco is working on is a casino being built on Choctaw tribal land in Durant, Oklahoma. With every Native American-owned casino, Bowers sees an economic opportunity for all. ""Trash bags, everybody uses trash bags -- so just for an example, let's all get together and order trash bags and it's going to be cheaper on all of us,"" Bowers says, pointing out that there is a Native American trash bag supplier. When discussing the potential of the Native American Group, Ballenger remembers something her father used to show her. ""(He) showed me one stick and [said] you can break one stick easily,"" Ballenger recalls. ""When you bundle many sticks together, it is impossible to break."" This is her wish for the consortium -- ""That we will bundle these many sticks together and become impossible to break.""",0.52616453,4277
136,"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In ancient China, a hat tells of social rank. For the six Ngan siblings, hats tell the story of their rise to fortune. A shop assistant displays a Beijing 2008 Olympic Games baseball cap. The Ngan siblings grew up in a poor rural village in China's Fujian province in the 1960s and 1970s in the newly established communist China. People in Fujian and elsewhere in mainland China would speak of the fortunes that could be made in the booming Hong Kong economy. Occasionally, the talk would lead some to move to the international capitalist enclave. Today, the siblings operate their own headwear making and cosmetic trading businesses. One sister's company is the only licensed headwear manufacturer for the upcoming Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. ""Everybody has opportunities in Hong Kong, it's up to you if you'll take the chance, and make use of your talents,"" says the third and the eldest sister, Ngan Po Ling, Pauline. If the hat fits, wear it . None of the Ngan siblings wear hats regularly. They say hats don't really fit their oriental faces. The eldest brother Ngan Shun Kwing, without any other job offers, found work at a hat factory when he first arrived in Hong Kong in 1972. Four years later, Ngan Shun Kwing started his own hat company with his second brother. ""Doing your own business is better than being employed,"" Ngan Shun Kwing, now 55, says. ""I have no qualifications, nobody hires me. And, when can you earn millions as a factory worker?"" The family united in 1980 when the parents and four younger siblings obtained approval to move to Hong Kong. Some of them, including their father, helped with the hat business. The company grew and later branched out to Global Headwear Ltd., which owns factories in China, Cambodia and Bangladesh with more than 10,000 workers, offices in six U.S. cities and major clients include Polo Ralph Lauren and Abercrombie & Fitch. The three Ngan brothers and some of their children manage the corporation, which has also diversified in mining and recycling. The three sisters are also entrepreneurs, but only the fourth sibling, Ngan Po Wan, Wendy, 45, is out of the headwear trade. She started Kingstar International Trading Ltd. in 1992 with her husband and the company is now the Hong Kong, Macau and China distributor of world-famous skin care products, including Guinot and La Colline. Pauline, 48, also started a company with her husband, Ngan Hei Keung. In 1986 the couple began trading headwear and promotional goods and later the company formed the group, Mainland Headwear Holdings Ltd., which was listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2000. ""My elder brothers' success is the spur and encouragement,"" Pauline says, ""For us the younger ones, we follow their path."" Mainland Headwear is a world leader in licensed headwear manufacturing. The company holds sole license to manufacture headwear for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, and worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute FIFA World Cup headwear in Greater China and Japan from 2007 to 2014.  Watch a spokeswoman lead a tour of the plant » . Ngan Shun Kwing, Pauline and Wendy attributed their success to their parents' upbringing and tough rural life in Mainland China, which nurtured their exceptional diligence and determination in facing all challenges in life. From harsh rural life to Hong Kong . Back in the quiet life in Chishui town in Dehua, Fujian, life was very different from Hong Kong's. The siblings ate sweet potatoes in congee (rice porridge), while receiving new clothes and enjoyed meat only once a year during the Chinese New Year. At night, they hardly had electric lights on. They spoke Fujian's Chinese dialect Hokkien and the national language Putonghua. The family did small businesses. Ngan Shun Kwing and Pauline were sent to the nearby mountain Daiyun Shan to learn from farmers during the Cultural Revolution's ""Down to the Countryside Movement."" ""The hardest life in the world is being a farmer."" Ngan Shun Kwing says. ""If you can endure a farmer's life in China, nothing is even harder."" Pauline stayed with a family of six children whose mother died. As a young woman, she was assigned to a heavy responsibility in taking care of the family and the farm animals. ""Living in a society that rejects you, abandons you, look down on you, your inside gets even stronger,"" Pauline says. So when she arrived in Hong Kong, she was even more determined to work hard and become a successful person. The trip headed to Hong Kong was the Ngan siblings' first time on a train. The contrast between the rural and city lives created many exciting first-time experiences for the Ngan siblings when they landed in the city -- seeing airplanes, the hundreds of lights above their heads, ringing a door bell and using a coin-operated telephone. And, the first time to learn English and Cantonese -- the dominant Chinese dialect used in Hong Kong and parts of southeast China. ""We didn't even know there's something called Cantonese,"" Ngan Shun Kwing says. ""Even a coolie [unskilled laborer] needed to speak Cantonese to get hired."" Father Ngan encouraged the younger four siblings to study English. He told his children that English would secure a better career and provide opportunities abroad. ""My father is a very far-sighted person."" Wendy says, ""He did something that helped us a lifetime. If we didn't study English, I could have worked in a factory for my whole life."" In the first few years in Hong Kong, Pauline and Wendy had full days; two hours in English class, working two part-time jobs until 10 at night, and then more language studies until 3 in the morning. Although some classmates in the English class once looked down on them as mainland migrants, Wendy says she is grateful for her experiences; she says she now carries herself with greater confidence. ""Now as we [classmates] meet up, they would show respect and admiration for what we've become,"" Wendy says. Siblings share close relationship . Despite being in the same industry, the siblings claim different clients in the headwear market and do not have direct competition. The siblings are thankful for their self-made fortune. ""People respect our ... family, not because of our businesses, but our unity,"" Pauline says. The siblings' closeness can be understood in measurable terms: Pauline and Wendy are literally next-door neighbors; the three siblings living in the U.S. are just two to five minutes drive away. The siblings are bond by their love for work and food. When the siblings get together, they drink and chat for the entire night. They also share a favorite song -- You gotta fight, then you can win (""Ai piah jia eh iah""), originally sang in the Chinese dialect of Hokkien. The song was first published in 1988 in Taiwan, and quickly became popular among Chinese communities around the world. The song tells of the Ngan siblings' heartfelt thoughts, and of those who strived for a better living in their diasporas from villages to cities, from homeland to abroad. Pauline says she's been lucky in her life. Not many people can go through the variety of experiences she had, including the backward life in rural China, the Cultural Revolution, and Hong Kong's economic miracle. Looking back, Pauline still thinks of the ""Hong Kong Dream"" rather undreamed of. ""Today's life is like heaven,"" Pauline says, ""When I was a kid, when I think of a heaven, it's not even as beautiful as today's life."" The Ngans joined the hundreds of thousands who defined China's first modern Horatio Alger stories. Today, Hong Kong is known as a center of international finance. However, without first establishing itself as a hotbed for the textile and manufacturing industries, the city would have never made this economic progression.",0.5260998,2985
137,"(CNN) -- Normally, ""hot spot"" isn't the first phrase that comes to mind when talking about Saskatchewan, Canada. A relocation service company president said he is moving more people to Saskatchewan than ever before. But with most of Canada suffering from devastating job losses, this cold province is becoming exactly that. It's an asterisk to the entire country when it comes to the economic climate, and Premier Brad Wall is shouting it as loud as he can. ""It's a great time to come to Saskatchewan,"" said Wall, who even called the Toronto Star newspaper to tout his province's economic success and let Ontarians know there were jobs for the taking. ""For those who are losing their jobs, we need them to know we have thousands of jobs open right now in both the private and public sector,"" Wall said. ""We have a powerful story to tell, a story of success and that's something we want to share with those who are struggling."" Wall's province is one of the exceptions to the unemployment increases battering provinces across Canada. Saskatchewan's unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in January from 4.2 percent in December, making it the only province recording a decline. In Ontario and the city of Toronto, unemployment rates rose to 7.2 percent and 8.5 percent respectively. To the west, British Columbia shed 68,000 full-time jobs in January. More Saskatchewan jobs should be on the way. To stave off any possible recession, Wall announced a $500 million infrastructure ""booster shot"" to help keep the economy strong.   Learn more about different towns in Saskatchewan » . ""All across the country, industries are getting quite ill,"" Wall said. ""We aren't immune to it. We see some impacts in terms of layoffs and new vehicle purchases slowing off, and so we want to be proactive in staying ahead of the curve."" On Tuesday, the Conference Board of Canada released a report that said Saskatchewan will likely continue to lead the nation in economic growth in 2009 because of the infrastructure investment and tax reductions. The province has also been reaping the benefits of an influx from nearby Alberta. When the government in Alberta decided to raise the oil royalty rates, oil exploration and expedition companies decided to move their operations to Saskatchewan in hopes of making more money. With the province's growing opportunities, David Montgomery, president of Calgary's Qwest Haven Relocation Services, said he is moving more people to Saskatchewan each day. ""Alberta has always been the gravy train of oil,"" said Montgomery, who is also a former resident of Regina, the capitol and second-largest city in Saskatchewan. ""But with the new royalties, oil companies are saying 'Why stay here and make less when the opportunities right next door are even better?' Many other companies may start to follow suit."" Montgomery said people looking to move have said that cheaper land and insurance prices are among the other reasons they are headed to Saskatchewan. ""There, government insurance is cheaper than anywhere else in the country and it comes with your license plates,"" he said. ""With the amount of jobs, cheaper opportunities and great way of life, the government there has made it very attractive to move there."" That means more business for Wall's province and more jobs coming to the area. Not that there's a shortage of jobs. On Tuesday night there were nearly 6,000 private- and public-sector jobs on the Web site Saskjobs.ca. A constant stream of revenue from oil production and exports also buoys the economy in the province. Saskatchewan falls just behind Alberta, as the largest oil exporter in Canada, and Wall's province sends more oil to the United States than Kuwait. Wall said the province is the leader in uranium production and produces a third of the world's potash. The province continues to keep ahead of the curve, Wall said, finding ways to diversify its resources and embark on ambitious green projects and new oil projects. The province is working with Montana on a $212 million climate change initiative that would create the first major greenhouse gas storage project in North America. The carbon dioxide from coal-fueled power plants would be stored in the ground in Montana and later be withdrawn for use in oil production. Wall also said what may be the largest discovery of sweet, light crude oil in the southeast part of the province means it could have even more oil to work with. The Bakken Formation could potentially have 413 billion barrels of oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That would be another huge untapped revenue gold mine. Despite the growth of nearly all sectors across the board, Wall cautioned that it is possible his province may see economic stress, just later in the game than other places. ""We need to be circumspect and prudent about promoting our province,"" he said. ""We are not immune; we do see the impacts. It isn't some sort of panacea or answer to economic questions that don't exist elsewhere. We are a bit of an asterisk that says there is some stress, but it's relatively calm here."" Wall encouraged people not to count out a move to the province based on stereotypes that it is ""only winter here,"" and ""all of the land is just rolling hills."" ""'It's a beautiful, big place where life is great and right now there's also opportunity,"" he said. ""I'm very, very biased, but I can't imagine a place I'd rather be, especially with what's going on economically around the world.""",0.52599275,3485
138,"MBOLA, Tanzania (CNN)  -- Moved by a 2007 trip to Ghana, singer/songwriter John Legend joined the fight to end extreme poverty in his lifetime. And based on his experiences in poor, rural areas of Africa, he says, real change is possible. John Legend says ""Mama"" Mwadawa Ruziga's role in uplifting her community inspired him. ""I don't want people to only see Africa as a bunch of victims,"" Legend says. ""The people that I've come across in these extremely impoverished villages, they want to work. They want to participate in their own development."" To help people lift themselves out of poverty, Legend founded the Show Me Campaign, named after one of his songs. Partnering with economist Jeffrey Sachs' Millennium Promise organization, Legend's group adopted Mbola, a remote village in Tanzania that has little access to drinking water and improved farming techniques, according to Millennium Promise. ""The folks in Mbola are starting at a supreme disadvantage. Most of them are living on less than a dollar a day,"" Legend says. ""It's difficult for them to even survive."" On his 2007 visit to Mbola, Legend met ""Mama"" Mwadawa Ruziga, a single mother of two who was freeing herself from poverty. Her entrepreneurial spirit impressed Legend and solidified his belief that sustainable development at the community level can work in the fight against poverty. Ruziga leads a local business collective that sells products -- like wine, jam and juice -- that it makes out of indigenous fruits. ""I was really inspired by her willingness to not just wait for a handout, but really take an active role in helping to uplift her community,"" he says. Through the Show Me Campaign, Legend has pledged to raise $1.5 million over five years to support programs similar to Ruziga's that are aimed at alleviating poverty in Mbola. But this is not just about cutting a check, he says. ""You can always go in and bring an influx of money and address things temporarily. But if development's not sustainable, then something's wrong,"" Legend says. ""This is about teaching them how to farm better, improving the education system, getting water pumps. The idea is that [the community] will continue to sustain themselves over time."" Before joining her collective, Ruziga, 47, says her life was at an all-time low. For years, she suffered through malaria and droughts. ""The only thing I did was farming, then I would just sit idle with nothing to do. But after joining the group, my life changed for the better, slowly by slowly,"" Ruziga says. In addition to agricultural processing, Ruziga's group focuses on horticulture and tree planting. Ruziga herself has been instrumental to the success of the group, traveling to trade shows in the Tanzanian cities of Tabora and Dar es Salaam to sell their products. ""Our group has spread to other areas of Tanzania, and we've experienced great success because many people have come to know about us,"" Ruziga says.  Watch Legend talk about meeting Ruziga, and see her group making products » . Six different villages have adopted the group's successful model. ""I think she's a great example of someone who's given the tools to succeed, having the energy, having the follow-through, having the leadership skills to go ahead and do it,"" Legend says. Not only has Ruziga's group changed her own life, but other members' lives have also improved. This is the first time that some of them have ever earned an income. ""Now they are more educated than before,"" Ruziga says. ""The group provides them with a platform to exchange and explore ideas, and the revenue collected enables the members to cater for their basic needs.""

The longtime Veuve Clicquot champagne house executive has a wisdom about women, French and otherwise, that's made her one others turn to for advice. The former CEO and best-selling author of ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" and ""French Women for All Seasons"" is now toasting her latest book, ""Women, Work & the Art of Savoir Faire: Business Sense & Sensibility."" Inspired by the young women who've approached her for guidance, Guiliano, who splits her time between New York and Paris, set out to impart what she's learned through her career. ""We have to help each other and help especially the young generation progress and not make the same mistakes we did,"" she said. ""These very difficult times, with the recession and all of that, are actually a positive for women because it gives us a chance to make a difference and show that we are becoming the majority, and we should be treated as such."" CNN sat down recently with Guiliano to discuss the word that hurts the careers of women most, the lessons her mother taught her and any last-minute tips she has to prevent holiday-food overindulgence. Here are excerpts from that interview: . CNN: What exactly is this art of savoir faire you speak of? Guiliano: Savoir faire is a complex set, a mix I should say, of competence, experience and knowing somehow instinctively how to make a decision in a given situation. [It's] creating your own luck and your own opportunities and then making the most of them. CNN: What are the pitfalls you've seen women fall into most often and how do you think they can be avoided? Guiliano: The word that I found comes back over and over again in women's lives when it pertains to their professions is the word fear. They're afraid to make a move. They're afraid to take a job in another state or another city or another country. They're afraid to go for an interview. They're afraid to take a promotion because they might not be up to the job. It comes from our culture, of course, the low self-esteem and low confidence we have, and we have to change that. CNN: How did you not fall into that trap? Guiliano: I used my mother's management principle, which was ironic because my mother didn't go to school and wasn't a businesswoman. But she told me to not be afraid to take risks and to ask myself , ""What is the worst thing that can happen?"" ... When you have that in mind, it gives you a special strength to go ahead, be bold and take the chances. CNN: When you talk about what ""our culture"" has taught women, do you see a difference between American women and French women? And as a Frenchwoman who's lived and worked in New York, what have those differences meant to you? Guiliano: Being and working in America, it's very important to work hard, work smart and work in a certain way. France and Europe has, with the tradition and culture, it's slow-moving and it's not always good. So you have to find a balance between the two. I know that I could have never accomplished what I have if I had stayed in France. CNN: Why do you say that? Guiliano: Because the opportunities were not there. Because it's much more of a man's world. In France, it's still very difficult for women to move ahead and to get into the boardroom or [serve as] CEO and all of that. That has to change. CNN: But what about the need for more balance in American women's lives? Guiliano: Balance -- that's what it's about. At the end of the day, each of us is responsible for our own balance. It starts with the physical because when you are healthy physically, of course, you have more energy, you are more bubbly, you are more productive, you're a happier person. And I believe it's contagious. Your spouse will notice it, your colleagues will notice it, and it will have a tremendous positive effect on the way you work, the way you think and the way you do everything. CNN: Do you have tips on how to achieve this? Guiliano: Find times to relax, to pursue your hobbies, your moments because this is very important. It's unfortunate that sometimes our companies, our bosses don't understand that we need that time. Actually it makes us better workers. We shouldn't feel guilty going for a walk at lunch, as opposed to eating at our desks. Each of us has different ways. For you, it might be five minutes, three times a day, of deep breathing. And for me it might be 20 minutes of yoga in the morning. Or for someone else it might be listening to music or going for a walk. Whatever it is, you need that. CNN: You've also, since your first book, emphasized the importance of eating well. We are in the midst of the most gluttonous season, and though it might be a little late to apply your advice this year around, do you have any last-minute tips for how we can approach holiday parties? Guiliano: You have to apply a few commonsense tricks. At most of those parties, the food is not that great to start with, so don't go hungry and starving. Have two tablespoons of a yogurt or a sliver of cheese or a few nuts or a hard-boiled egg or an apple before you go, so you're not starving, and then try not to be too close to the food. Or look at all the food and pick two or three things you like and just have small portions, small bites. ... People in America, in the Anglo-Saxon world, tend to say ""no bread."" You can have a little bit of everything. It's all about moderation and balance.",0.51466787,9528
142,"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- At Beijing's East Train Station, some travelers are literally carrying their lives on their back. Passengers crowd a railway platform in Beijing as New Year holiday migrations get underway. ""I don't know if I'm going to come back,"" said one migrant worker on his way to his home province. ""I might just end up working on the farm."" He was weighed down by a giant pack filled with everything he could call his own. Millions of migrant workers are leaving the cities, returning to their homes in the vast Chinese countryside, for the Chinese New Year holidays. But not all will be celebrating. Many do not have jobs to come back to. They flocked to the urban areas during boom times to earn a better living. Some have not seen their families for years -- the trip home is too expensive. But they have sent money home faithfully every month. When they finally can go home, the journey is long.  Watch passengers haul huge bags on journey home » . ""I will be standing on the train for 24 hours,"" said one man on his way to Zhejiang province on the country's eastern seaboard. Some will travel much farther. The migrant workers are among 188 million people heading home for the holidays, also known in China as Spring Festival. But the actual numbers might be much higher. Travel is already up significantly compared to last year, when brutal snowstorms stranded passengers for days.  Watch this year's snowstorms grip part of China » . This year, more people seem to be going home than usual because of the global economic crisis. There are so many passengers trying to get from one place to another that tickets are hard to come by. Planes, trains and buses are fully loaded to destinations across the country. The train is the most popular option, cheaper than a plane and faster than a bus. But tickets are selling out fast. Some people have waited in line for hours, even days to get a ticket. ""I started standing in line three days ago,"" said one man. ""There's no way to buy the ticket."" Others stood at the entrance to Beijing's East Station with signs. ""Need two tickets to Weihan"" or ""Want to go to Inner Mongolia."" Some blame the ticket shortage on scalpers who are hoarding tickets, then re-selling them for a profit. One man said he wanted 100 yuan or $15 more per fare and indicated he had tickets to multiple destinations. The Chinese government has cracked down on scalpers, arresting more than 4,000. But many Chinese think scalpers are more of a solution, than a problem. One woman told us she bought a ticket from a scalper because there was no other way. All the tickets to her hometown were sold out days in advance. The desperate hunt for tickets is a sign this could be China's most massive mass migration ever. And with the Chinese economy slowing down so much, so fast, this may be the last time some people are making the trip.",0.5067516,3029
143,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- More than six hundred workers at Total's Lindsey oil refinery in Northern England have been told they no longer have jobs after staging what the company calls an ""unofficial, illegal walk out."" Protesters gathered outside Total's Lindsey oil refinery on Friday, June 19, after hundreds of striking workers were sacked. The steel workers started striking last Thursday after one contractor axed 51 jobs while another employer on the same site was recruiting. Protesters gathered outside Total's Lindsey oil refinery Friday with placards calling for solidarity from fellow workers. The dispute has prompted a number of wildcat strikes at power stations and oil refineries around the United Kingdom. The workers' union GMB, which represents around half of the sacked workers, estimates that, as of late yesterday, up to 4,000 other workers at four power stations and three oil refineries had walked off the job in sympathy. Early this afternoon, Total confirmed that negotiations had started between the workers' employers and ACAS, the British Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. Earlier, in a statement posted on its Web site, Total announced that its contractors had started the process of ending employment contracts for 647 workers on the HDS-3 construction project. The statement said the project has been temporarily shut down and that all employees had until 5pm on Monday to reapply for their jobs. Phil Davies, national secretary and head of the manufacturing section at the GMB Union, told CNN the invitation to a job interview would only stoke workers' anger. ""I think that would just humiliate people to be quite honest and it will put their backs up and make them more determined to win it,"" he said. He said union representatives were in the process of gathering information to hold an official industrial ballot, a process that could take six weeks. The British Press Association published one sacked Lindsey worker's appeal for support from fellow union members: ""We are asking for support from workers across the country which I am sure will be given. Total will soon realize they have unleashed a monster."" Workers at the Lindsey oil refinery walked off the job for more than one week in early February to protest against the hiring of hundreds of foreign workers. They returned to work after the unions and the company gave assurances that half the jobs would go to British workers.",0.5058799,4824
144,"TROUTVILLE, Virginia (CNN) -- For the past year, Donna Chamberlain has worked at a fuel center here in Virginia's Roanoke Valley. It pays roughly half of what her old job did, but after being out of work for 14 months, she feels lucky to have it. Wachovia, which distributes the debit cards, would not comment on how much it receives for their use. Adding to her concerns, she and her husband, Steve, are now the custodial parents of their 7-year-old special-needs grandson, Cayden. The family needs every penny it can collect. So when state officials replaced the roughly $40-a-week child support check with a debit card, Donna read the fine print -- and left it on the table. ""It was automatically generated, and had my name on it,"" she told CNN. ""This thing had 10 fees."" Watch Chamberlain discuss the hidden fees . Virginia is one of two dozen states that use debit cards as one means of distributing child support payments, a move that allows them to reduce the amount of money spent issuing and mailing checks. But the fees attached to the debit cards can accumulate quickly: 50 cents to make a telephone balance inquiry; 65 cents to make an ATM withdrawal after two free withdrawals are taken; and $2.75 if the card is used at an out-of-network bank. Chamberlain found one charge particularly galling. North Carolina-based banking giant Wachovia, which distributes the funds on Virginia's behalf, said it would deduct $2.50 from her account for more than one face-to-face visit at one of its banks. ""If you should go to the bank teller window, you get to go once a month,"" she said. ""But if you want to talk to anybody about your money more than once a month, it's going to cost us $2.50 to walk in the door of the bank."" Wachovia would not comment on how much it receives from the program, and referred CNN to Virginia state officials. But with an increasing number of states turning to debit cards to distribute money for programs such as child support, the fees attached to those cards are drawing criticism from consumer advocates. ""These cards can come with hidden fees, subject to identify theft and unauthorized charges,"" said Lauren Saunders, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center in Washington. ""And, unlike a credit card, you don't get a regular statement, so you can't check on these charges. Some of them have gotchas like overdraft fees that are added on. So, there's dangers, and if these cards are structured unfairly, they can be a problem."" Many recipients aren't aware of the fees, even though they are usually sent a list of the charges along with a new debit card, Saunders said. Virginia allows child support recipients to receive payment via debit card, direct deposit or check. But it has been pushing the use of debit cards since 2006, said Nick Young, the head of Virginia's Department of Social Services. In 2008, approximately $279 million in child support payments were distributed via the Wachovia debit cards. Young told CNN that he had no idea how much money Wachovia made from debit card fees, but said most of them could be avoided with ""wise"" use of the cards. ""I will admit that if somebody takes their $300 out, $10 at a time, they will in essence defeat the purpose of the card,"" he told CNN. ""And they will suffer."" In 2008, about 52 percent of child support recipients used direct deposit, Young said. A little more than 41 percent chose debit cards. Only 1,877 people chose to get money by check last year in the state, he said. Virginia also uses debit cards to distribute state retiree payments, and it is one of 30 states to use them to pay unemployment benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In a CNN report on the practice earlier this month, the Labor Department said debit cards are safer and more secure than checks, allow the unemployed to avoid check-cashing fees and frees them from keeping excess cash around. In Pennsylvania, divorce attorney Susan E. Murray advises clients in her state to turn down the debit cards for child support. ""They will nickel-and-dime you to death,"" she said. ""If someone is getting $200 a month in child support, the fees really start cutting into their money."" The program is ""horrible"" for families, she said. ""It's a win for the state, it's a win for the bank, but the kids lose. Children are the losers under this program. It's unconscionable."" Back in Virginia, Chamberlain's debit card is still stuck to the letter the state sent to her home. She'll stick with a check, thank you.",0.49868834,2178
145,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- One of the things I find frustrating about modern American life is we wait for someone else -- anybody else -- to solve whatever problem it is that's out there. Clark Howard says Best Buy should have lauded employees who ran after a shoplifter, not fired them. We see something and feel like it's not our job. It's the ""not in my silo"" mentality found in corporate America. But there are times we wait for help to arrive when we're the help we seek. Unfortunately, this mentality has seeped beyond corporate America into normal earthlings. Have you heard the story about Jared Bergstreser and Colin Trapp? These two Best Buy employees tackled a shoplifter they saw busting out of their Denver, Colorado-area store with stolen electronics. They wrestled the suspect to the ground at great personal risk. The perpetrator pulled out a knife and cut a manager before ultimately escaping, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bergstreser had been a three-year employee, while Trapp was on the job for less than a year. What did Best Buy do for these employees who showed such extreme loyalty? They fired them. A spokeswoman for Best Buy said the company won't comment on the terminations. However, she said the company's employees are aware of a policy of not pursuing shoplifters. Best Buy says the policy is in place for the safety of its employees.  Watch Clark reveal a Vegas vacation scam » . This case is not unusual. I am privy to a story about a separate incident that happened with a discount retailer. Again, a couple of guys I know who were employees tackled a shoplifter. The suspect then pulled out a gun and tried to shoot them. They managed to disarm the shoplifter after he fired and he was taken into custody. Did they get a reward or bonus from their employer? No, they were canned. I got some interesting reactions when I discussed these two stories in a pre-show meeting with my team. Somebody immediately piped up saying, ""Of course they have to fire them because of liability."" Liability?! One of my producers even called me a vigilante. After all, I'm the guy who chased down my own mugger on a Madrid subway train during a staff trip to Spain. In retrospect, what I did was really stupid because I could have gotten injured or worse. But my natural instinct just took over and I successfully recovered my wallet. The idea that we're supposed to stand by idly and allow people to steal from us or steal from an employer is something that I just cannot support. I think we have a responsibility to get involved. Otherwise, if you let a small number of lawbreakers get away with it whenever, then they get away with it over and over and over again. I could understand if Best Buy were so cowardly and afraid of a lawsuit that they felt these two employees should be sent to ""Best Buy re-education camp."" Fine. But to fire them for trying to stop a brazen criminal who was armed and dangerous and busting out of the store with electronics? I just don't get it. And remember, when Bergstreser and Trapp went after this person, there was no benefit for them, unlike my experience being mugged in Madrid. They were putting themselves in danger to protect their employer. You should be, if not rewarded for that, then at least not punished! I believe Best Buy is sending a terrible message by firing them.

146,"(CNN) -- Jenny's phone number is for sale, but not for a song. ""867-5309/Jenny"" originally appeared on Tommy Tutone's ""Tommy Tutone 2"" album. Bids for a New Jersey version of the number, stuck in the minds of millions since Tommy Tutone's ""867-5309/Jenny"" hit the Top 10 in 1982, had reached $5,100 on eBay as of Monday morning. The song is about a guy who finds Jenny's name and number scribbled on a bathroom wall. ""This is really, in my opinion, one of the last cultural remnants of the '80s pop culture era ... other than the mullet,"" said Spencer Potter, a 28-year-old DJ who is selling the number he got for free five years ago. While Potter is overlooking the fact that ""867-5309"" is an active phone number in dozens of other area codes, it does get called a lot by curious people. Potter said he has gotten about 40 calls a day since he got the area code 201 version for his Weehawken, New Jersey, DJ business. ""The minute we plugged the phone jack into the wall, it began ringing,"" Potter said. Mostly, Potter said, the callers are ""a lot of '80s fanatics"" and he lets the calls ring through to his voice mail. When he did answer a call three years ago, Potter found his own Jenny on the line. ""She had been using my number to give out to guys that she didn't like at bars,"" he said. ""It was a bum phone number."" The young lady from Hoboken, New Jersey, told Potter she was just curious about who might be getting the calls. Potter ended up asking her out. ""I figured if she was having to give out a bum number that often then she was probably pretty cute,"" he said. ""We ended up meeting for drinks. We dated for awhile and it was actually a great friendship."" Potter recently moved from Weehawken and decided to try to make money off the infamous digits with an eBay auction. Potter's DJ business goes with the number, a necessary provision to get around phone company rules against selling telephone numbers, he said. Phone companies technically own the numbers, not the customers. Potter said Vonage, the company that assigned the number, gave him permission to transfer it as part of the sale of his business. EBay halted a 2004 auction by the purported holder of the 212 area code version of the number, The New York Times reported. A Philadelphia-area resident who holds the toll-free versions -- both 800 and 888 -- said he values his numbers in the millions. Jeffrey Steinberg said his best offer so far, rejected several years ago, was for $1 million from a national weight-loss company. He acquired the numbers in the early 1990s for a pizza delivery campaign and has licensed them for other advertisers in the years since. Potter said when his auction ends next Monday, February 9, he hopes to make at least $40,000. He said he would use the money to take a Caribbean vacation -- away from his ringing phone. .

If you've rolled up your sleeves and gotten experience, tell potential employers when applying for a job. Talk to a dozen students on any college campus and you're likely to hear a dozen different perspectives on what they hope to get out of college. Some want high GPAs; some want to get into the work force and earn a lot of money. Ask their parents and you'll get just as many different answers. Some parents hope that their children earn their degree and have an easy time finding a job. Others want them to be at the top of the class so they can get into the best graduate school possible. And some just want their children to stop partying long enough to attend class once in a while. Ask employers what they want from graduates and the answers are equally diverse. Depending on the job, you might need a degree and an internship, a degree and work experience, or the right connections to even land an interview. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 39 million Americans over the age of 18 have a bachelor's degree. Considering that 281 million people live in the country, college graduates are still a small percentage of the population. Still, with a number in the millions, you are competing with a lot of job seekers who also have the same educational background as you. Relying only on your bachelor's to land a job is not the safest route to employment. As with most things, it's all in the presentation. Degree or not, presentation matters . Sue Chehrenegar studied biology as an undergraduate and biomedical research as a graduate student. During her job search, she found herself losing out on job opportunities because she lacked the proper experience, despite her education. Or so she thought. ""At the end of the 1980s, I spent more than one year looking for a job,"" she remembers. ""I kept getting this question: 'Have you done anything in the area of molecular biology?'"" She would tell employers that she didn't have the proper experience because she wasn't specifically trained for that. ""I did not mention the fact that I once assisted a graduate student who was putting DNA and RNA into cultured cells."" What does that mean in layman's terms? Because her specialization and the bulk of her experience was not in this particular field, she didn't consider the limited work with the graduate student worth mentioning. She later realized employers weren't looking for someone to be the ultimate authority on the subject; they wanted someone who had a broad range of knowledge. ""I realized my mistake more than two years after I got a job,"" Chehrenegar remembers. ""My first year I worked in an infectious disease lab. Later, they put me in a molecular biology lab. When I helped with one of the projects in that lab, I realized that my old, unmentioned experience related to what I was doing at that time."" A degree isn't useless . Sure, if you're applying for a job with bio- as a prefix, you know a degree is a requirement. But for less research-intensive jobs, you might think a degree can always be supplanted by enough experience. Depending on your occupation, that could be true but isn't a hard and fast rule for all positions. For example, you might be able to find work at a museum, but you the odds of you transitioning into a curator can be extremely difficult without extensive education in art history and related courses. You could find that you hit a ceiling in an organization. Although this bodes well for graduates who come armed with one or more degrees, it also means that workers in this industry have the opportunity to earn an education while they ascend the corporate ladder. In some cases, the combination of their experience and a recently awarded degree could be more impressive if you've relied on your degree and haven't diversified your experience. How to present yourself . Here are some tips to keep in mind when presenting yourself to employers: . • Even though you know education isn't the single factor in getting hired, it is often a prerequisite to land an interview. Don't hide your degree just because you have a lot of experience -- you don't want to lose out on an interview because your education was overlooked. • Use all of your education to your advantage. Connect the job requirements to any courses you took, whether as an elective or part of your minor. You might not have loved that statistics course, but if it's relevant to the job, mention it. • Treat work experience and internships as proof that you're a professional, not just a student. If you speak as if you see yourself as a student who doesn't consider himself or herself as part of the working world, the employer might not either. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009.

148,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Valerie Gooding is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in Europe as named by the Financial Times. She runs global health and care organization BUPA and under her leadership it has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries and record revenues. CNN's Todd Benjamin spoke to her in London and began by asking her why there are so few women at the top. She said it goes beyond family issues. Gooding: Women sometimes don't put themselves forward for things. And one of the things I think about and talk about a lot is that women often lack confidence to go for the next job, the top job. They sometimes don't wish to compete or they don't think they're good enough for the next thing. Benjamin: Why do you think that is? Gooding: Partly a lack of role models, partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family, in work. But also I think there is still -- I don't like to call it a glass ceiling, but I think there is still an unseen barrier for women, which is that, if you ask most business people, would they like to promote more women, they would all say yes, they'd love to: ""Where are these women, I want to promote them,"" will be the answer. But often they don't really automatically think of a woman first for a top job. Benjamin: And what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top? Gooding: Well, first of all, to learn as much as you can and to make sure you've got the right experience, the right qualifications, and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction. But I think another piece of advice I would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want, because I think one thing that happens with women, which perhaps is a gender difference, is that women often hang back and think ""I will be noticed for my results, everybody will see how great I am because I've delivered these exceptional outcomes"". But actually life isn't like that, you have to tell people about your results and your achievements, and men are often better at doing that than women are. Benjamin: What do you think separates good leadership from great leadership? Gooding: Well, I think good leaders should be judged on their results. And I think of a good leader you should be able to say ""she transformed the business,"" ""she upped the performance,"" ""she exceeded the expectations of the stakeholders."" I think of a great leader I would go to that old Chinese saying, ""of a great leader the people will say ""we did it ourselves"""". Benjamin: Do you think that women in general as managers are more inclusive than men? Gooding: No, I don't. In fact, I sometimes find these gender differences, when sort of represented in the business environment, are actually just not very useful. I think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and I don't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide. Because I have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial, and I've equally seen men who are very consultative. So, I don't just think it divides that way. Benjamin: You clearly love what you do. What is it about business that you think is such a buzz? Gooding: It's the constant challenge, there's always something new, there's a new competitor, there's a new pressure, there's a new opportunity, there's a new challenge, I think that's what keeps us all going. I think it's the thrill of the chase, basically. E-mail to a friend .",0.47872144,307
149,"(CNN)  -- It's a trip that would make Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher blush. On Friday, the Carnival cruise ship Elation, sponsored by the world's largest nonprofit singles travel group, will make history by hosting the world's first International Cougar Cruise, and we don't mean the animal. Defined by the Urban Dictionary, a cougar is ""an older woman who frequents clubs in order to score with a much younger man."" It can be anyone from ""an overly surgically altered wind tunnel victim, to an absolute sad and bloated old horn-meister."" ""A cougar is generally known as a woman over 40 who likes to date younger men, but theoretically any woman who dates younger men is a cougar,"" said Rich Gosse, who came up with the cougar cruise idea. The ship, which sets sail from San Diego, California, to Ensenada, Mexico, for three nights, is booked for 300 guests and even has a waiting list. The ship has three swimming pools, a seven-deck-high atrium, bar and grill, a Moroccan-inspired Casablanca Casino and a lounge that features stage shows, according to Ann Thomas, owner of the Singles Travel Company and organizer of the Cougar Cruise. After making port in Ensenada, the cruise offers extracurricular activities like horseback riding, ATVing and other outdoor excursions. ""There's at least four or five options a day for people to get together on the cruise. We're doing lots of activities; dancing, dining, Jacuzzi parties, karaoke for two hours. And starting at $125 a ticket, it's a great price,"" Thomas said. ""I've had to hire two more people part-time just to pick up the phones,"" she said. ""I've never seen a response quite like this."" Thomas admits that she was hesitant to sign on to the idea but is glad she did. ""We have people flying in from Italy and Denmark. My associates have been booking from France, Canada. It's fascinating,"" Thomas said. Gosse, who has been hosting singles events for more than 30 years, said he got the idea after hosting a cougar convention in Palo Alto, California. ""We had to turn away hundreds of people,"" Gosse said. ""Then we did one in Beverly Hills and had a massive crowd down there, so I thought, maybe we should do a cougar cruise. I didn't think anyone would want to go. Needless to say, the phone is ringing off the hook."" These cougars may as well be an endangered species compared with those hunting them on this cruise. ""The basic problem is, we have is too many cubs,"" Gosse said. ""We usually have too many women and not enough guys, but there's been a paradigm shift in recent years, so now the cubs are more excited about it than the cougars."" A ""cub"" is someone in their 20s or early 30s who likes to date older women, according to Gosse. For years, he says, it's been socially acceptable for older men to date younger women. But in recent years, a phenomenon sparked by celebrities like Kutcher, baseball player Alex Rodriguez (who is said to have dated pop star Madonna) and others has led a new generation of younger men on the prowl for more experienced partners. There is even an ABC sitcom called ""Cougar Town"" that glamorizes the sexual escapades of a 40-something divorcee on a search for self-discovery by dating younger men. ""Tim Robbins [and] Susan Sarandon was the first high-profile cougar-cub relationship,"" Gosse said of the actors, who have been together since the late 1980s. ""Now we're seeing a paradigm shift where these younger guys are actively looking for older women."" ""If you look at the demographics, the only logical way for people to get their needs met is for younger men to date older women,"" he said. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, for every 100 single women in their 20s in America, there are 118 single men in their 20s. The reason, Gosse said, is that young women are dating older guys. ""When you're single, you always wish the person meets someone they want to be with. If this is something they want, then I wish them well,"" Thomas said.",0.4750982,9170
150,"(CNN) -- It may take a lot of frequent-flier miles, a penchant for cold places, a tolerance of taxes and regular doses of chocolate, but happiness could be within reach. However, it's not where most people might expect. Journalist Eric Weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness. Just ask Eric Weiner, who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe, uncovering lots of surprises along the way. Hungering for a tropical paradise? A warm climate doesn't necessarily make a happy nation, Weiner said. Thinking of moving to a wealthy state? Money can degrade happiness, he found. Weiner, who wrote the book, ""The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World,"" began his quest for very personal reasons. ""I'm an unhappy person, so it's kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food,"" he said. Weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world. It was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite. Weiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods, choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role. A world map of happiness, based on 100 different studies and produced by Britain's University of Leicester in 2006, listed Denmark as the world's happiest nation. But for Weiner, the place where he felt the most bliss was a toss-up between Bhutan and Iceland, countries that ranked eighth and fourth, respectively, on the happiness map. Weiner's list of favorites also included Thailand, India and Switzerland.  See photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why they're happy » . His top two picks, though very different countries, have unconventional paths to happiness, he said. ""Bhutan is probably the closest thing on Earth to Shangri-La, that fictional paradise,"" Weiner explained. He pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product, the Himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of ""gross national happiness."" ""The Bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision,"" Weiner said. Cold place, warm relationships . Thousands of miles away, Weiner found happiness in a very different environment, marveling at the creativity and ""coziness"" of Iceland. ""Everyone in Iceland is a poet,"" Weiner recalled. He visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the  cold and the darkness. Such a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships, Weiner found. ""The cold inspires people to cooperate, traditionally. If you go back a few hundred years, people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together. It's that simple,"" he said. Weiner found a different flavor of happiness in Switzerland, where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork. Simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness, he said. But there may be a much sweeter reason why Switzerland is a happy place. ""The Swiss eat a lot of chocolate, and let's not forget that,"" Weiner said. He was also impressed with how the Swiss view money. ""Their attitude is that if you've got it, hide it. While our attitude is if you've got it, flaunt it,"" Weiner said, comparing the Swiss to Americans. Weiner called the United States, which came in at No. 23 on the University of Leicester's world map of happiness, a nation that ""is not as happy as it is wealthy."" The impact of wealth and taxes . The relationship between money and happiness took Weiner to the Middle East and Qatar, a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, thanks to oil and natural gas revenues, according to the CIA World Factbook. ""I went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery,"" Weiner said. He found the wealth made the residents comfortable, but also degraded their level of contentment. ""Most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people,"" Weiner said. ""The money in Qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off, literally and figuratively, from other people. ... That's not a recipe for happiness."" There are no income taxes in Qatar, but that's not a cause for contentment, Weiner found. Some taxation is necessary for happiness because it's a way of being invested in a place, he argued. ""You're giving money to someone else, a government, and you're trusting them to do something good with it,"" Weiner said. ""In a country where there's no taxation at all, people don't have vested interests in how well the government performs. You can't say, 'Hey, those are my tax dollars at work.'"" Quest creates buzz . Weiner's book has struck a chord, recently rising to the top 10 of The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. An expert who studies happiness said part of the book's appeal may lie in how Weiner mapped out his journey. ""He arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass,"" said Daniel Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of ""Stumbling on Happiness."" Gilbert said it's only recently that a combination of biology, sociology and psychology has been able to answer the ""where's and why's"" of happiness, a subject that has always fascinated people. ""The quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings,"" Gilbert said. He echoed Weiner's findings that bliss is other people. ""Everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships, well, bingo, they're right,"" Gilbert said. Meanwhile, after a year of exploring some of the world's happiest places, Weiner -- the self-described ""grump"" -- said his mind-set has improved somewhat. ""I would describe myself as a recovering grump,"" Weiner said. ""At this point, I think I am marginally happier than before I started the project."" E-mail to a friend .",0.47309583,213
151,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In 2009, some units of the New York Police Department still function more like ""Dragnet"" than ""CSI."" They rely on typewriters. Records show New York City signed a $432,900 contract for typewriter maintenance with in 2008. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne confirmed the department's continued, if limited, use of the 20th-century writing devices, explaining that they're mainly used for filling out property vouchers -- forms that officers must file when they seize items during case investigations. The typewriters also are retained in case a technological meltdown disables the NYPD's computers, he said. The vintage typing machines do not come cheap. Public records show that the city signed a $432,900 contract for typewriter maintenance with Afax Business Machines in 2008, as well as a $99,570 contract with that company in 2009. Typewriter company Swintec received a $982,269 contract from the city in 2007. Eugene O'Donnell, a former New York police officer who now lectures at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the typewriters are an anachronism -- and a waste. ""The two places you'd find typewriters are the museum and the police department,"" O'Donnell said. Typewriters create significant efficiency and storage problems for the department, he added, causing extra labor and unwieldy paper trails. Deputy Commissioner Browne emphasized that ""we have a $4 billion budget"" and the financial resources devoted to typewriters are relatively miniscule. Officers interviewed by CNN on the street had no soft spots for the contraptions. ""It's so antiquated,"" said one officer who did not want to be identified. Her partner shared her frustration. ""It's very inconvenient -- you have to find ink, you have to find this, find that.""",0.47119707,8957

When Twitter asks ""What are you doing,"" maybe you should be following tweets on job advice. When microblogging and social networking site Twitter debuted three years ago, plenty of people wrote it off as yet another pointless addition in the overcrowded networking world. Considering the site only allows people to post, or Tweet, messages of 140 characters or less, you can't blame early skeptics. But little by little, users proved the site's worth to nonbelievers.

155,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- As Christmas season went into full swing this year, Glen Fullmer's 7-year-old son came home from school with an assignment: Make a poster illustrating his family holiday traditions. The boy wasn't sure how to proceed because he and his family are Baha'is, not Christians, and they have no holidays during the Christmas season. Thus, Fullmer encountered the ""December Dilemma"" -- the term used for the quandaries and anxieties non-Christians and interfaith couples face during Christmas season. Fullmer, a Baha'i faith spokesman who lives in Evanston, Illinois, said he saw the poster assignment as a ""teachable moment"" for his 4-, 7- and 10-year-old sons who associated holiday traditions with Christmas. He reminded his boys that Baha'is have a gift-giving and charity period in February called Ayyam-i-Ha, a stretch of time not unlike the Christmas season. And he helped his son design the poster about that holiday, which precedes a fasting period and then the Baha'i New Year in March. ""His classmates asked him questions about the holiday, and one of his friends came up to him and wants to celebrate that holiday,"" Fullmer said, pleased that his son's peers helped him reaffirm his identity. Navigating the Christmas season can be a challenge for the millions of people who don't celebrate the holiday. Many acknowledge and sometime embrace the season's customs, such as gift-giving and sending out greeting cards, while at the same time they are conscious of maintaining their own religious identities. ""They strongly try to maintain their own integrity, but they really want to find bridges across holidays,"" said the Rev. Dr. Paul Numrich, a professor at the Theological Consortium of Greater Columbus in Ohio. ""I think that's the majority."" L.S. Narasimhan, chairman of the Georgia Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, is a Hindu and doesn't celebrate Christmas. But he said he admires the Christian celebrations of his friends and has attended Christmas Eve services at several churches. ""Hindus are typically more open-minded and tolerant. Hinduism is very comfortable in accommodating a diversity of ideas,"" he said. ""It is very common for Hindu families to have Christmas trees at their homes, purely as a fun thing to do for their children. When they visit shopping malls, Hindu parents in general are comfortable with a photo-op for their little kids with Santa."" But at the same time, there are pressures about the encroachment of Christianity on Hindu life. ""Television commercials, good selection of merchandise and great sale prices persuade Hindu-Americans to take advantage of the shopping spree,"" Narasimhan said. ""Several Hindu temples have risen up to the challenge and added some special Hindu prayers and ceremonies to engage Hindus who are on winter holidays but not on overseas vacations."" Dr. Shefali Chheda, an Atlanta-area pediatrician, is a Jain -- practicing a religion with Indian roots. Growing up in Houston, Texas, she said her parents ""felt comfortable letting us celebrate Christmas,"" perhaps to help fit into American society and maintain a sense of normalcy. ""The spirit and meaning of Christmas, of helping others and of giving, are nice messages. Therefore, it is hard to consciously object to it,"" Chheda said. ""Jains, as a whole, are a minority in India. Many Jains celebrate Hindu holidays, so celebrating Christmas with Santa and a tree and presents is no different. Since Jains wholeheartedly believe in 'ahimsa' -- peace toward all living beings in thought, word and action -- the Christmas spirit is a very Jain-like philosophy."" The religious aspect of Christmas -- believing Jesus is the savior and that December 25 is his birthday -- is not celebrated in Jainism, but the customs and symbols are interwoven into daily life, she said. ""Now that I have toddlers in the house, they come home with stories about Christmas. They sing songs about Rudolph and Santa, and Kwanzaa, and Hanukkah. But it's Santa that everyone talks about, so they talk about him as well,"" Chheda said. ""I use Santa as a behavioral modification tool. 'Santa's watching you, so you better be good' works infinitely better than timeout. My kids will be living in this country; they will have a hard enough time anyway with their names and food and other cultural traditions; Christmas -- and the Christmas spirit -- is not one tradition that I want to take away from them."" Jesus plays a role in the theology of other religions, such as the Baha'i faith and Islam, even though those faiths don't observe Christmas as a religious holiday. The Christmas season presented a struggle for Haris Tarin, director of the Washington office of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee. He grew up in Los Angeles, California, area schools, where he sang the ever-present Christmas carols and made the gingerbread houses in schools but didn't have a tree in his home. ""We definitely had a little bit of anxiety in childhood,"" Tarin said. But that changed as he grew up and refined his American Muslim persona amid the American atmosphere of diversity and tolerance. Now, where he and his family live in northern Virginia, ""we don't celebrate Christmas. We celebrate our holidays"" -- pointing, for example, to Eid al-Fitr after Ramadan and Eid al-Adha after the hajj pilgrimage. But he welcomes the goodwill of the season -- the gift-exchanges with non-Muslim neighbors and the requests from schoolteachers to talk about Muslim holidays. ""There's definitely going to be a level of discomfort, especially for those who aren't used to that diverse culture that we belong to,"" he said. But the unease spawns discussion, presenting a useful opportunity to help young people and newcomers, he said. For Jews, the eight-day holiday of Hanukkah happens to fall during the Christmas season. Hanukkah is wildly popular and observed, with its special foods, gift-giving and candle lighting, and with its symbols such as the menorah -- a candelabrum -- and the dreidel, a toy that spins like a top. Compared with other non-Christians, many Jews have drawn a sharper line in the sand when it comes to observing Christmas, a stance informed by historic, theological and self-preservation reasons. That attitude emerged recently during a young professionals' get-together at an Indian restaurant outside Atlanta sponsored by the American Jewish Committee and Young Indian Professionals. People there indicated that attending Christmas-themed holiday parties, exchanging greeting cards and wishing Christian friends ""Merry Christmas"" are surely not uncommon or unacceptable among Jews. But some practices are widely shunned -- such as plunking one's child on Santa's lap at the mall, and deplored -- such as assigning kids in public schools to write a letter to Santa Claus. ""It's a beautiful season. It brings out a joy,"" said Hannah Vahaba, who organized the Jewish-Indian event. ""But I'm not going to celebrate it."" Interfaith couples celebrate their diversity during the Christmas season. Jeff Silver, a certified public accountant who is Jewish, and Shweta Gupta, a dentist who is Hindu, are planning their marriage next year. They will have an interfaith household and said they hope to raise children to understand both of their traditions. At their home in Atlanta, they've set up a holiday tree decorated with Hindu and Jewish ornaments. Non-religious Americans embrace a December ""secular holiday"" called HumanLight. Patrick Colucci, vice chair of the HumanLight Committee and member of the New Jersey Humanist Network, said the holiday can uplift ""atheist, humanist and nonreligious"" people who feel left out and isolated during Christmas. It was a perfect fit for him when it came along, he said, because ""it corresponds with my humanity-based ethics and values, without any supernatural or theistic beliefs. My 'holiday season' is HumanLight and New Year's Eve -- that's what I celebrate."" ""The only dilemma, in my experience is, if Christmas is part of the larger family tradition, and then some family members reject us for not believing in it anymore. We're not out to take Christmas away from anyone who wants to celebrate it -- there is no 'war on Christmas,' "" Colucci said. How do Christians themselves see the presence and practices of non-Christians during Christmas? While many would like to see non-Christians convert to Christianity, they also recognize that the United States is a ""diverse society"" and that conversion ""is not even on their radar screen,"" said Numrich, the theology professor. ""There's a deep American virtue in respecting religious differences,"" he said.",0.43059954,8134

158,"(CareerBuilder.com) -- The importance of references seems to be a hot topic these days. Employers want to make sure they are hiring the right person for the job; but some thwart the process because checking references can be labor-intensive. On the other hand, job seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report, but employers are getting smarter and finding references you didn't provide. So, what's the deal? Do references matter? Do employers even check them anymore? What's the protocol for providing them to a potential employer? Who are the best people to include as references? And, if an employer doesn't call any of your references, is it a bad sign? While the definitive answer to any of these questions depends on the employer, overall, yes, references do still matter. The process has just changed. ""References play a huge role in the hiring process, perhaps now more than ever,"" said Heather R. Huhman, founder and president of Come Recommended, an online community that connects internship and entry-level job candidates with employers."" Oftentimes, hiring managers fall in love with a candidate on paper and then again in an interview, only to find out through a reference check that none of their previous employers would ever hire them again. By checking a candidate's references, hiring managers save themselves the frustration of hiring a person who is not a good fit for a company. In this economy, where hiring budgets are slim, every hire must be a great fit."" Provided references are no guarantee . Though the majority of employers do check references, others skip this step. Not only is it labor-intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer, but Jack Harsh, adjunct professor at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business, said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references. ""[Hiring] decisions cannot be based on information that is discriminatory in nature, so to avoid any liability, the checks are forgone,"" Harsh said. ""Sadly, the first reference the employer gets in such cases is from colleagues after employment has begun."" Steve Langerud, director of career development at Depauw University, adds that sometimes, the quality of references is benign. ""Everyone wants to be helpful and supportive to former employees, but in the end, they offer little substance to a new employer,"" he says. ""Legally, they are limited by what they can or want to say about former employees. I think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields."" Langerud warns that just because an employer isn't checking personal references the traditional way doesn't mean he isn't checking references at all. ""Employers are more likely to check the informal, but tangible, behavioral reference sources like LinkedIn, Facebook, credit history [or] criminal history than the more subjective references provided by candidates,"" he said.

159,"(CareerBuilder.com) -- The importance of references seems to be a hot topic these days. Employers want to make sure they are hiring the right person for the job; but some thwart the process because checking references can be labor-intensive. On the other hand, job seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report, but employers are getting smarter and finding references you didn't provide. So, what's the deal? Do references matter? Do employers even check them anymore? What's the protocol for providing them to a potential employer? Who are the best people to include as references? And, if an employer doesn't call any of your references, is it a bad sign? While the definitive answer to any of these questions depends on the employer, overall, yes, references do still matter. The process has just changed. ""References play a huge role in the hiring process, perhaps now more than ever,"" said Heather R. Huhman, founder and president of Come Recommended, an online community that connects internship and entry-level job candidates with employers."" Oftentimes, hiring managers fall in love with a candidate on paper and then again in an interview, only to find out through a reference check that none of their previous employers would ever hire them again. By checking a candidate's references, hiring managers save themselves the frustration of hiring a person who is not a good fit for a company. In this economy, where hiring budgets are slim, every hire must be a great fit."" Provided references are no guarantee . Though the majority of employers do check references, others skip this step. Not only is it labor-intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer, but Jack Harsh, adjunct professor at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business, said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references. ""[Hiring] decisions cannot be based on information that is discriminatory in nature, so to avoid any liability, the checks are forgone,"" Harsh said. ""Sadly, the first reference the employer gets in such cases is from colleagues after employment has begun."" Steve Langerud, director of career development at Depauw University, adds that sometimes, the quality of references is benign. ""Everyone wants to be helpful and supportive to former employees, but in the end, they offer little substance to a new employer,"" he says. ""Legally, they are limited by what they can or want to say about former employees. I think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields."" Langerud warns that just because an employer isn't checking personal references the traditional way doesn't mean he isn't checking references at all. ""Employers are more likely to check the informal, but tangible, behavioral reference sources like LinkedIn, Facebook, credit history [or] criminal history than the more subjective references provided by candidates,"" he said.
