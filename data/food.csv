0,"(Mental Floss) -- 1. The Hamburger -- Louis' Lunch, New Haven, Connecticut . This burger did not come from Louis' so ketchup is OK. There are competing claims for the coveted ""Inventor of the Hamburger"" title, but according to Louis' Lunch (and the Library of Congress, for that matter), this small New Haven restaurant takes the prize. The story goes something like this: One day in 1900, a rushed businessman asked owner Louis Lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run. Lassen cooked up a beef patty, put it between some bread, and sent the man on his way. Pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time, huh? If you visit Louis' today, you'll find that not much has changed. The Lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant, the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves, and, just like then, there is absolutely no ketchup allowed. 2. The Fried Twinkie -- The ChipShop, Brooklyn, New York . Sometimes what counts isn't being the inventor, it's being the innovator. Take the fried Twinkie, for example. The Twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory-- has been around for ages, but when ChipShop owner Christopher Sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack, dip it in batter, and deep-fry it, the Twinkie took gluttony to new heights. Even The New York Times raved about how ""something magical"" happens when you taste the deep-fried Twinkie's ""luscious vanilla flavor."" Sell, who was trained in classical French cuisine, didn't start with the Twinkie, though. In his native England, he fried up everything from M&M's to Mars bars. 3. Root Beer Float -- Myers Avenue Red Soda Co., Cripple Creek, Colorado . If you thought what happened up on Cripple Creek only happened in song, you're sorely mistaken. In August of 1893, a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named Frank J. Wisner was drinking a bottle of his Myers Avenue Red root beer while looking up at Cow Mountain. Just then, a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain, and Wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer. The new drink was christened the ""black cow"" and became an instant classic. Today, of course, most of us call it a root beer float. 4. Corn Dogs -- Cozy Dog Drive In, Springfield, Illinois . In 1946, Ed Waldmire, Jr., revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the Cozy Dog -- the first corn dog on a stick. At first, he wanted to call his creation the ""Crusty Cur,"" but his wife convinced him to change the name to ""Cozy Dog."" She felt people wouldn't want to eat something described as ""crusty."" Good call, Mrs. Waldmire. Shortly after the Cozy Dog's inception, the Cozy Dog Drive In opened alongside old Route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since. 5. The Pizzeria -- Lombardi's, New York City, New York . Pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time, but America got her first true pizzeria when Gennaro Lombardi opened up a small grocery store in New York City's Little Italy. An employee named Anthony ""Totonno"" Pero started selling pizzas out of the back, and in no time, Lombardi's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries. In 1905, the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria, and it's stayed that way ever since. Well, almost. The original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later. On its 100th anniversary in 2005, Lombardi's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie. Needless to say, the line wrapped around the block. 6. Fat Darrell -- R.U. Hungry, New Brunswick, New Jersey . You may not know what the Fat Darrell is, but when you hear what it contains, you'll understand why it's truly a work of inspired genius. Since 1979, Rutgers University has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the ""Grease Trucks."" Originally, they served a sandwich called the Fat Cat, which contained two cheeseburger patties, French fries, lettuce, tomato, and onions. Then one night in 1997, a hungry (and broke) student named Darrell W. Butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, French fries, and marinara sauce on a sandwich. Strangely, the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it, and the Fat Darrell became a mainstay at the Grease Trucks. Hey, not any old sandwich gets to be named Maxim magazine's top ""Meat Hog"" sandwich. 7. Philly Cheesesteak -- Pat's King Of Steaks, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Philadelphia is known for many things (Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bell, and Rocky, for starters), but fine dining is not really its forte. That's OK, though, because Philly is the home of Pat's King of Steaks, and Pat's King of Steaks is where the Philly cheesesteak was born. One day back in 1932, hot dog stand owners Pasquale (Pat) and Harry Olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions. A cab driver who ate at Pat's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich, and with the first bite declared, ""Hey, forget 'bout those hot dogs, you should sell these!"" Cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone, so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested. In no time, the modest stand turned into the Pat's that exists today. Controversy remains, however, over who's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak. Pat's claims it was the first to do so (in 1951), but across-the-street rival Joe Vento of Geno's Steaks (opened 1966) insists he added the finishing touches. 8. Onion Rings -- Pig Stand, Dallas, Texas . According to most sources, the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a Pig Stand location in Dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter, then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination. Now, you'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain, but not Pig Stand. The company also lays claim to opening America's first drive-in, inventing Texas toast, and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs. Not bad for a little outfit from Texas. 9. Derby Pie -- Melrose Inn, Prospect, Kentucky . A Kentucky favorite, derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that's about all we know about it. Why? Because the recipe is jealously guarded by the Kern family. Melrose Inn manager George Kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents, Walter and Leaudra, and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time. In fact, Mrs. Kern, being the crafty monopolist she was, copyrighted the name, and to this day, you can only get real ""Derby-Pie®"" through Kern's Kitchen, Inc. Not only that, but a man from New England once handed Leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home. She refused.I E-mail to a friend .

1,"New York (CNN) -- The legendary New York restaurant Tavern on the Green will close its doors after serving a last supper and hosting a New Year's party. The iconic spot on the western edge of Central Park will undergo major renovations under a new operator and may even retain its famous name, but to many patrons, this is indisputably the end of an era. Claudia Myers and Wayne Knowles, a semi-retired couple visiting from Norfolk, Virginia, were saddened by the news and decided to treat themselves to one last Tavern dinner. ""I came here years ago and had good memories,"" Knowles said. ""It's the atmosphere and ambience"" Myers added. ""Everyone knows what Tavern on the Green is and where is it"" -- here, Myers paused -- ""except one cab driver. It's just a neat place. It has history and it's in the park."" Ed Brown and his wife, Judy, also were in town for the holidays from Plantation, Florida, and were aware of the restaurant's plans. ""It's my first and last time at eating at Tavern on the Green,"" Brown said. ""At least I can now say I ate there."" Rodney Shephard recently was making preparations for his last party, for 1,500 guests. It's nothing the restaurant's maitre d' for the past 23 years couldn't handle, but he wasn't looking forward to his last party on his last day of employment at the restaurant. ""I never thought this day would come"" said Shephard, 52. ""Not like this. Not like the money-making machine that this place is."" The restaurant served its first meal in 1936, when Mayor Fiorello La Guardia presided over its opening as the city and the country were trying to dig out from the Great Depression. The restaurant almost died in 1974 when the operator  shuttered the ""rustic little money-losing pub,"" as New York Times food writer Eric Asimov later described it. But Warner LeRoy immediately took over the Tavern's lease and invested $10 million. He added two rooms to the existing four and installed scores of copper and brass chandeliers, Tiffany-style stained glass, bull's-eye glass mirrors and ornate pastel-colored fixtures, and a 167-foot mural depicting Central Park. After its 1976 reopening, words like ""playful,"" ""dazzling"" and ""eclectic"" were used to describe the restaurant's ambience and the menu. ""It was an over-the-top whimsical place,"" said longtime publicist Shelley Clark. Warner Leroy's father, Mervyn LeRoy, was the producer of the ""Wizard of Oz,"" A black-and-white photograph hanging in the Tavern shows Warner as a child with Judy Garland on the set of the movie. Jennifer Oz LeRoy, in her recently published book ""Tavern on the Green 125 Recipes for Good Times,"" -- co-authored by her mother, Kay -- described the vision of the restaurant that her father wanted. ""When he walked into the courtyard of the run-down building, he imagined something wholly original and incredible: He would build a room in that space that would look like the inside of a wedding cake."" she recalled. ""He was a brilliant showman and a brilliant restaurateur. He was bigger than life."" said the Tavern's chief operating officer, Michael Desiderio. ""He thought dining is like a great show, and when the curtain goes up everything must be perfect."" Shephard, who started as a front desk manager, fondly recalled LeRoy and the sense of family that he brought to the establishment: ""It's like a second home. I consider the employees like your brothers and sisters, and now it's all going to be cut off."" The restaurant became the destination for anniversaries, birthdays and family affairs, It served more than 500,000 people a year, an average of 1,400 dinners a night. Tourists eagerly descended upon the eatery for the crab cakes, wedge salad, salmon and parmesan-crusted chicken. Food critics were not so thrilled. Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor for Bon Appetit magazine, said the restaurant has never been the greatest venue for foodies. ""When you're serving 2,000 meals a deal, I don't care if you're [chef] Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud, you just can't put out that much of a volume and have top quality food."" The LeRoy family was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a bidding war for to another proprietor, Dean Poll, who also owns the Boathouse Restaurant in Central Park. Once the restaurant closes, its contents will be auctioned off by Guernsey's auction house. As part of the 20-year license to operate the restaurant, Poll is expected to invest $25 million on renovations. While maintaining the Victorian historic features of the building, Poll's plan is to incorporate green building technology as well as replacing the kitchen and electrical and plumbing systems. The renovations, which are expected to take four years, will be conducted in phases so the restaurant can remain open. Attorney Barry LePatner, who represents Poll, said the new revitalized restaurant will become a popular destination for tourists and New Yorkers alike. ""The new incarnation of Tavern on the Green will integrate modern respect with an iconic location and a sensibility that will warm to New Yorkers"" LePatner said. ""We want more New Yorkers as well as tourists."" LePatner said that while the terms of the lease are still being negotiated with the city parks department and issues with labor unions are still unresolved, Poll's vision is to create a new era. ""The game plan is to have one of the biggest creative moments in the history of the city, and bring Tavern on the Green back to its original, enhanced luster."" One issue that is still left unresolved is the iconic name of the restaurant, which the current management estimates is valued at $19 million. The LeRoy family claims it trademarked the name in 1981. U.S. District Court Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum is expected to make a ruling in January. In the meantime, LePatner said, the city has filed a trademark for ""Tavern in the Park"" but that Poll would like to retain the original name and that it should rest with the site. Warner LeRoy, who was fond of flamboyant bashes, probably would approve of the Tavern's plan to say farewell on New Year's Eve. Over the park, as fireworks light up the sky and as the last party-goers exit, they will gaze at the 750,000 tiny white light bulbs that envelop the restaurant and just hope the new owners remember to keep the lights on.",0.78534806,9356
2,"NEW YORK -- There's no shortage of diners in New York City, but one of its most beloved will soon be taking up residence in Alabama. The Cheyenne Diner, which opened in 1940 in New York City, shut its doors in April 2008. The Cheyenne Diner, which first opened in 1940, was split in two Monday night to begin its move on a pair of flatbed trucks some 860 miles to its new home near Birmingham. The dining experience at the Cheyenne was typical of many similar New York eateries, where more often than not, you're guaranteed a hearty meal at a comfortable price. After taking a seat in a roomy booth or even at the counter, you check out the flimsy paper placemat with innocuous historical information or a simplified map of the Greek Isles. A busboy places a glass of ice water on your table. Then it's time to break out the reading glasses and flex those muscles to heft the always lengthy menu. While it may take you several minutes to sift through it, take comfort in knowing that you may actually burn some calories by lifting this bible of comfort food. Unlike the sometimes stuffy pretense of a formal restaurant, the diner experience is generally simple, while the food offerings are diverse -- from apple pie to baked ziti and everything in between. While never known as a bastion for fine dining, the Cheyenne saw brighter days before it unceremoniously closed on a chilly Sunday in April 2008. Originally known as the Market Diner until its moniker was changed in 1986, the pre-assembled restaurant stood as a rare classic definition of free-standing diners. Its streamlined, railcar-inspired design boasts a reverse-channel illuminated neon sign. Horizontal and vertical stainless steel strips border the colorful enamel panels and wrap-around windows on its facade. Celebrities from Jerry Lewis to David Letterman entered through its curved entryway lined with glass blocks. But, like a beloved baseball team whose owner has tossed in the towel, the Cheyenne is moving to a new town for a new life in a new home. The owner of the diner, George Papas, wanted to change the flavor of the block and replace the eatery with a multilevel condo building. Enter preservationist Michael Perlman, a 26-year-old patron saint of sorts for unwanted diners. Perlman found out that the Cheyenne was facing demolition and began to look for a guardian angel to save it. He connected with Alabama businessman Joel Owens, head of the investment group NAIC, who saw the Cheyenne for sale on a Web site devoted to the preservation of New York City structures and fell in love with its ""gorgeous structure."" ""I like it better each time I see it,"" Owens said. ""The barrel roof. The exterior facades are second to none. I think it's the most beautiful diner in the world."" Owens and his business associate, Patti Miller, have a grand vision for the diner and eventually want to incorporate it as part of an entertainment and historic area outside of Birmingham. Once it's restored, which could take up to a year, the Cheyenne will become the first free-standing diner in Alabama, Owens said. A longtime collector of antique cars and Coca-Cola memorabilia, Owens is a firm believer in the lessons that can be learned from the past. ""If you think about what's wrong with today, in order to fix the problems of today, you've got to look back... [to] when it was better,"" Owens said. ""I think [the diner] is symbolic of the glory days. Technology and more money doesn't necessarily mean progress. We long for simpler times,"" he explained. ""These types of buildings can be an instrument for our youth to learn from the past. Teenagers need a clean environment for entertainment, a 'hang out.'"" The departure of the Cheyenne Diner brings back some bitter memories for aficionados of historic New York. The Moondance Diner encountered a similar fate in 2007, after it was put up for sale by developers who purchased the land it was sitting on and planned to build a hotel. That summer, a couple from Wyoming found the Moondance's sale notice on the American Diner Museum Web site. Perlman acted as a conduit there also, helping to broker the sale of the 1920s diner located in the SoHo section of Manhattan, which the couple planned to move to their home state. When news of the sale and move came out, the Pierces began to have some doubts. ""We're quiet people,"" said Cheryl Pierce, of La Barge, Wyoming. ""[But] the media response has been a blessing as people have shown a keen interest."" Pierce and her husband paid $7,500 for the Moondance and ultimately invested $40,000 to move it more than 2,100 miles to La Barge, where it became a popular site in the town of 600 residents with few other restaurants. The barrel-roofed diner reopened on January 12 this year, complete with its original floor and window frames. Customers can sit at the old-fashioned soda fountain or on the outdoor patio in the summer. The menu contains the traditional diner fare -- burgers, fries and milk shakes -- but also caters to the local palate, with chicken fried steaks, ribeye steaks and prime rib. ""Business has been exceptional. We've been able to hold our own,"" said Pierce. ""We get a lot of people who take a detour to visit us."" She noted that it's a lot of work, and a huge commitment, but said she and her husband ""have been blessed."" ""There's never going to be another Moondance Diner,"" she said. In response to critics who complain that historic pieces of New York City are being sold off, Pierce said that in the cases of old diners, ""to keep it alive, somewhere else is the best option, [rather] than seeing it demolished. We've run into New Yorkers who are appreciative that we brought it back to life."" Owens is hoping that will be the case with the Cheyenne, which was loved as a no-frills refuge for comfort food on Manhattan's desolate west side. But now it's served up its last order in New York. And that last order was to go.",0.76025426,7019
3,"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- David and Christina Macfarlane always dreamed of opening a restaurant. And with David's background as a White House chef, they certainly have the in-house culinary ability. David and Christina Macfarlane in their Minneapolis restaurant, L'Ecosse. But they never imagined they'd be doing it in one of the toughest economic times ever, and they wondered if it would even be possible. ""The banks were like, 'You're opening a restaurant now?' "" Christina says. "" 'Yeah, we're opening a restaurant now.' "" David was born in Glasgow, Scotland, but moved to the United States with his family in his early teens and soon found his passion for the palate. Soon after high school, he joined the U.S. Navy, where he ultimately spent years cooking -- two of which were spent in the kitchen at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as a chef for President Clinton at the beginning of his first term in 1992. Looking at a picture of himself and the former president, David describes a favorite memory. ""He said that was the best meal he ever ate. I was pretty geeked about that.""  See more about that favorite meal » . But the Macfarlanes wanted more time as a family -- something not suited to David's high-profile job. They moved a number of times before settling down in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, suburbs where, most recently, David worked for Fusion Culinary -- until his position was eliminated, that is. Christina says that as dismayed as David was over the job loss, she saw it as ""a blessing."" ""I thought, 'Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!' "" she says, adding that she saw it as the perfect opportunity to follow through with their dream. Now, despite the battered economy, the two stand behind the bar in their new restaurant, L'Ecosse, which, incidentally, is French for ""Scotland."" However, they have a slightly different take on the menu than perhaps they would have had if times were perkier. ""We went to over a dozen restaurants looking at menus, pricepoints, [and] realizing the struggles in the economy,"" Christina recalls. The two concluded that while people are still eating out, they aren't seeking ""fancy"" food -- in other words, they weren't seeking the type of fare one might typically associate with state dinners at the White House. David says that's all a misconception anyway. ""Comfort food,"" he says. ""That's what the president wanted most."" Some of the president's favorite foods, David says were nachos and salsa, tuna sandwiches, or just warm milk and cookies. ""[President Clinton] wasn't looking for any of the fancy frou-frou stuff. We did that for state dinners or we did that for dignitaries that would come in, but ... at lunchtime when the president would be in the Oval Office by himself, [he'd say] 'Lemme have a tuna sandwich.' "" At L'Ecosse, tuna and warm cookies are on the menu. Keeping with his Scottish upbringing, David's menu also is largely UK-centric: meat pies and fish and chips are two of the specialties. He does it all with fresh, local ingredients and says he can keep prices down because he does a lot of the work himself and with the help of a very minimal staff.  Watch the chef talk about keeping it simple » . Everything on the breakfast and lunch menus is priced under $10, and the two say that when they expand to a full dinner menu once their liquor license is approved, they want to keep prices similarly low. ""The reason we did that was so nobody had sticker shock,"" David says. ""They're very good items, but they're also inexpensive items and you're not going to break the bank."" ""If you want to come in and get Bill Clinton's favorite, it doesn't have to be $15 during the day. And that's what we want people to understand -- we understand where you're at."" As Christina puts it, ""You are going to get great food that your mother used to make for you."" And, ideally, the bill won't send you into debt.",0.7516539,2621
4,"Washington (CNN) -- While administrations come and go, and power in Congress teeters between political parties, one thing remains constant in the lives of Washington, D.C.'s, elite: the power lunch. Between noon and 2 p.m., brokers meet to clinch deals, with the emphasis more on power than on lunch. Just steps from Capitol Hill, Charlie Palmer is one of the places to see and be seen at lunchtime. Depending on the week, the modern American steakhouse serves between 70 and 80 congressmen and between 20 and 30 senators. ""I'd bet we've had every member of Congress and every senator in the restaurant at some point,"" says Matt Hill, executive chef for the famed eatery. It's not just the proximity to Capitol Hill that draws Washington's elite to Charlie Palmer. The restaurant has several private dining areas -- including a rooftop with scenic views of the city -- and an executive chef who prides himself on serving homemade, inventive fare. ""We do anything, we've got senators from Hawaii that come in, and they ask for Hawaiian hors d'oeurves, we've got, you know, people from Texas that ask for things from Texas,"" Hill says. ""So, we can really vary the menu, and it makes it interesting for me to try to come up with new ideas."" Thirty-seven years ago, Tommy Jacomo moved to Washington with his brother and built The Palm with his bare hands. Now, as executive director of the famed power spot, Jacomo is known by Washington's elite as the keeper of the keys to The Palm. Everyone knows him. ""It's pretty frightening, yeah, you can't even walk down the street sometimes, Jacomo said. ""People say, 'Hey, Tommy! Put me down for two at 12:30,' and I don't even know who the hell they are."" The Palm has hosted every president from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. President Obama has yet to make a visit. But it's not just presidents who visit The Palm. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has frequented the restaurant since the Clinton administration. Cabinet secretaries including Madeleine Albright, administration officials, senators and representatives, Supreme Court justices, the city's top lobbyists, lawyers, strategists and media elites are all regulars at the Dupont Circle steakhouse. And if you become a regular, you get your picture on the wall. ""People used to think when we first opened up that we had all the [portraits of] Republicans on one side and all the [portraits of] Democrats on the other side,"" Jacomo said. ""It's not really as much thought behind it. It just goes up, it's good customers, loyal customers, famous people, infamous people, and I decide where I want to put them when I get the chance,"" he joked, pointing out the minimal space left on the wall. Not everyone is willing to put their picture on the wall. James Carville and Mary Matalin, who are political strategists and CNN contributors, chose to have their dogs' portraits on the wall instead of their own. While steakhouses remain a favorite, not all power restaurants dish out filet mignon. Steps from the White House are three of Washington's oldest power spots: The Oval Room, which serves up American fare; Bombay Club, which is Indian; and Old Ebbitt Grille, which also specializes in American cuisine. Cafe Milano, in Georgetown, and The Monocle and Johnny's Half Shell, on Capitol Hill, also remain abuzz with some of the most prominent people in Washington. Italian restaurant Posto on 14th Street has become a favorite among younger administration staffers because of its laid-back atmosphere and expansive dining room. Posto's sister restaurant Tosca, owned by Paolo Sacco, has kept D.C.'s top lobbyists and politicians coming back since it opened in 2001. Not only known for the power scene and homemade Italian cuisine, Tosca has set itself apart from others by having some of the most attentive waitstaff in the city. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, known by friends as a big foodie, has dined at Tosca, as have Emanuel and Obama adviser David Axelrod. The Washington Post reported that former Sen. Tom Daschle convinced then-freshman Sen. Obama to run for president at the Italian eatery. The newest member of the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, is known by friends as a ""very adventurous diner."" She is a fan of Lebanese Taverna, in Woodley Park, which serves up Middle Eastern fare. Serving up inventive sushi dishes like a fish-and-chips roll, or wasabi guacamole with wonton chips, SEI in Penn Quarter has established itself as a newcomer to the power scene, along with its neighbors Rasika and Oyamel -- all reported to have recently hosted first lady Michelle Obama. ""One of the things that's been sort of fun to watch over the course of this year is the Obamas have eaten out in a wide variety of places,"" says Garrett Graff,  editor of Washingtonian magazine. ""You've seen them come and get burgers up here on the Hill, you've seen them go out for burgers in Virginia, you've also seen them go out to some of the nicest restaurants in the city, like Citronelle and Blue Duck Tavern, where they went this fall for their anniversary dinner. But then you see Barack eating on his own -- he's going to a place like Ben's Chili Bowl or he's going to a place like Ray's Hell Burger."" Graff points out one top restaurant at which the Obamas have yet to dine. ""They still haven't been to what is widely considered to be the city's best restaurant, which is a small Greek place near Dupont Circle called Komi,"" Graff said. ""But one of the challenges with a place like Komi is that it's very small and books up far in advance, so it might be hard for the Obamas to sort of drop in there like they've been dropping in at a lot of these other restaurants.""",0.7162442,8705
5,"(Budget Travel) -- Last October, more than 40 people followed signs depicting a skull and crossbones, with a knife and fork in place of the bones, to a secluded Bavarian-style hunting lodge 30 minutes north of St. Louis. An Entre dinner party was hosted in a Missouri hunting lodge. The attendees didn't have any idea where they were headed or what to expect. All they knew was that they were in for a five-course meal courtesy of John-Jack, an undercover chef who'd invited each of them via a top-secret e-mail to the latest of what he calls his Entre dinner parties. Guests arrived to a bluegrass band jamming in a room decorated with deer antlers. As a fire crackled in the massive stone fireplace, they dined on wild-elk medallions, home-cured bacon, grapefruit confit, and butternut squash ice cream -- and toasted their good fortune with pumpkin ale from nearby microbrewery Schlafly. Welcome to the world of underground supper clubs. Getting a reservation requires a little detective work, but once in, you may never go back to eating out the old-school way again. The idea behind these dinners is to let talented chefs work their whisks in an affordable, relaxed setting. And since they're often operating out of their own kitchens, without a license to serve the public, these cooks have to keep the locales, and their own identities, under wraps. Budget Travel:  The utterly random dinner party . ""The trend started in food-centric cities like San Francisco, but in the last year, groups have been popping up across the country,"" says Jenn Garbee, author of ""Secret Suppers,"" which spotlights some of the more than 80 clubs now up and running in the U.S. One such is Guerrilla Cuisine, founded by an incognito cook in Charleston, South Carolina, who uses the alias Jimihatt and wears a ninja mask at his gatherings. As at many clubs, diners must submit their reservations weeks in advance on Jimihatt's Web site and then wait for an e-mail with directions to the hush-hush locale. Based on his track record, you won't be disappointed: The bearded Jimihatt and his rotating crew of sous-chefs have served secret, Southern-style suppers (andouille sausage gumbo, Cajun smoked chicken, chocolate beignets) in galleries, wineries, even a grocery store. Budget Travel: Haute diners . Jimihatt now has a little friendly competition from an Atlanta cook named Lady Rogue. Her RogueApron shindigs each have a different theme. At a recent event, a Great Depression-style repast in Lang-Carson Park, guests stood in a soup line for pancetta minestrone with porcini mushrooms, and lemongrass-spiked corn broth. Then they divided into teams for an impromptu game of Wiffle ball. ""Our goal,"" Lady Rogue says, ""is to make dining more inclusive and to have strangers connect over food. What better way to meet people?"" For those hoping to break bread with their own buddies, there's 12B in Vancouver. To keep operations simple, its mastermind, Chef Todd, hosts the six-course dinners in his own apartment, hence the name. And unlike most supper clubs, 12B cooks only for groups of friends (up to 12 at a time). Budget Travel: Pay-what-you-like restaurants . ""Even after working 16-hour days, I would sit at home and think, 'I've got to find a way to feed more people,'"" Chef Todd says. Money isn't the incentive. His minimum-donation fee of $50 just covers costs for a feast (stuffed artichoke hearts, five-mushroom ravioli, butter-poached scallops served with BBQ pulled pork) that would average twice as much in a restaurant. But as Chef Todd will attest, these clubs are less about saving and more about spending a night eating exceptionally well in the unlikeliest of places, whether a cozy lodge straight out of a fairy tale or a humble living room.

7,"(Mental Floss) -- Have you ever wondered about the origins and namesakes of our favorite spreads, sauces, and dressings? Here are a few stories that you can use to regale your friends the next time you chow down. Peppers were imported from the Mexican state of Tabasco to make spicy Tabasco sauce, giving the condiment its name. 1. Thousand Island Dressing . Is the delicious dressing that gives a Reuben its tanginess named after an actual chain of islands? You bet it is. The Thousand Islands are an archipelago that sits in the Saint Lawrence River on the U.S.-Canada border, and there are actually 1,793 of them, some of which are so small that they contain nothing more than a single home. So why is the dressing named after an archipelago? No one's quite sure. Some people claim that early film star and vaudevillian May Irwin, who summered on the Thousand Islands, named it, while others contend that George Boldt, the famed proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria, gave the dressing its name because of his own summer place in the region. No matter who named it, it's tough to beat on a sandwich. 2. Ranch Dressing . Yep, the beloved dressing and dipping sauce actually got its start on a real ranch. When Steve and Gayle Henson opened a dude ranch in California in 1954, they had an ace up their sleeves: a delicious dressing that Steve had concocted while the couple was living in Alaska. The couple did a nice business at their Hidden Valley Ranch, but guests were always flipping out over just how tasty Steve's dressing was. Eventually, the Hensons started bottling the stuff, and the popularity grew so quickly that they had to hire a twelve-man crew just to help mix up each batch. Steve's culinary creativity turned out to be lucrative; in 1972 Clorox forked over $8 million for the recipe. Mental Floss: Foods named after people . 3. A1 Steak Sauce . According to the brand's Web site, A1 has been around for quite a while. Henderson William Brand worked as the personal chef for King George IV from 1824 to 1831, and at some point during this employment mixed up a new sauce for the king to use on his beef. George IV allegedly took one bite of Brand's creation and declared that it was ""A1."" Brand then left the king's employ in order to go peddle his new sauce. 4. Tabasco Sauce . Tabasco sauce is perhaps the most famous of all hot sauces, but where did it get its name? When Edmund McIlhenny, a former banker, invented the sauce in Louisiana in 1868, he didn't have a huge supply of chili peppers at his disposal. To keep cooking, he imported peppers from the Mexican state of Tabasco and slapped the region's name on his bottles. Mental Floss: The origins of salt, pepper and other popular spices . 5. Heinz 57 . Legend has it that Heinz 57 takes its name from H.J. Heinz's company formerly marketing 57 products at once, and except for the number, the story holds up. Heinz's Web site tells a story that Henry John Heinz was riding a train when he saw a billboard advertising 21 varieties of shoes. He so liked the idea he wanted to try it with his own condiment company. Thus, he started touting Heinz's 57 varieties. There was only one catch: Heinz marketed well over 60 products at the time. So where did the 57 come from? Heinz thought the number was lucky. Five was Heinz's lucky number, and seven was his wife's. He mashed the charmed digits together, got 57, and never looked back. 6. Tartar Sauce . Fish's best friend is named after an alternate spelling of the word ""Tatar,"" which was how Western Europeans once referred to almost anyone of Mongolian or Turkic descent. Many of these Tatars/Tartars ran roughshod over Europe in the time of Genghis Khan, but they knew how to cook. One of the dishes they left behind, beef tartare, came back into fashion in 19th-century France. These helpings of steak tartare came with a number of garnishes, including the creamy white stuff that eventually became generically known as tartar sauce. Mental Floss: The history of utensils (spork included) 7. Hollandaise Sauce . Hollandaise, the lemon-butter-and-egg yumminess that Eggs Benedict can't live without, isn't actually Dutch. Instead, it's one of the most well known French sauces. The sauce first appeared in French cooking in the 17th century, and is apparently named both because it somewhat resembles an old Dutch sauce and because the Dutch had such thriving butter and egg industries that provided two of the sauce's main ingredients.

8,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Profits at celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's British restaurants plunged by nearly 90 percent in the last 12 months. Gordon Ramsay has become as successful on television as he has been off-screen. Run by the Scottish-born chef and his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, Gordon Ramsay Holdings reported a drop in annual turnover from £41.6 million ($68 million) to £35 million ($57 million) in the year to August 2008, Britain's Press Association reported Friday. Pre-tax profits plummeted by over £3 million ($4.9 million) to £383,325 ($627,000), while net debt in the group, which includes London restaurants such as Claridges, Maze and the flagship Royal Hospital Road, soared to almost £9.5 million ($15.5 million). With spiraling debts and crippling tax bills, the star of TV shows such as ""Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares"" and ""Hell's Kitchen"" was forced to pump huge amounts of his own money into the business, even selling his prized Ferrari to raise funds, The Guardian newspaper said. Ramsay has attributed his business problems to over-ambitious expansion plans, in addition to the closure of two of his 11 London eateries. The Michelin-starred chef opened ten restaurants between 2007 and 2008, while The Savoy Grill was forced to close as the Savoy hotel was refurbished, and the lease at the Connaught expired. The 42-year old was also forced to review his company's international operations, closing restaurants in Paris, Los Angeles and Prague, The Times newspaper reported. ""Ambition overtook me. We thought we could do anything, that we couldn't fail,"" PA quoted Ramsay as saying recently. A full review of the group's operations was instigated in December as part of a refinancing deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland and to help the business get through the troubled economic times. ""2008 brought its own challenges, not just for our group, but for the industry as a whole and the broader economy,"" Hutcheson told PA. ""Whilst the restructuring has benefited the group, the significant contribution and commitment of all 750 staff to the business has been integral to moving us to a position of strength."" Ramsay has endured a difficult time recently. Last month he was criticized by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd after reportedly comparing television star Tracy Grimshaw to a pig during a live cooking show in Melbourne. His trademark colorful language also came under fire last year by another Australian lawmaker. However Ramsay told the country's Channel Nine Network, which broadcasts Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, that the shows emphasize the ""pressures of working in a restaurant kitchen.""",0.65623474,9913
10,"(LifeWire) -- Janice Shih might be the most educated pastry chef you'll ever meet. Janice Shih left her career in medicine at age 38 and became a pastry chef. Shih attended Johns Hopkins University, followed by medical school at George Washington University, then practiced for eight years as an obstetrician/gynecologist before realizing that baking, not medicine, was her calling. ""Everyone would say, 'You're a doctor; it must be so great to be able to save lives,'"" she says. ""But I felt like I was just pushing papers and feeling pressure to see more patients in less time. It was very draining. It just wasn't fun anymore."" So in 2004, at age 38, she swapped her stethoscope for a rolling pin and enrolled in the pastry program at L'Academie de Cuisine in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ""I had always been interested in pastries -- mostly interested in eating them,"" she says with a laugh. Shih now owns Tenzo Artisan, a bakery and catering company in Baltimore that specializes in pastries for people with food allergies -- it's rewarding, she says, to make birthday cakes for people whose dietary sensitivities had forbidden such treats. She's one of thousands of career changers who have left their cubicles for culinary school. Enrollment has risen 40 percent since 2000 at the Culinary Institute of America, and it's up 15 percent this year at The Art Institutes, which operates 30 culinary programs across the country. The trend is helped by a growing cultural interest in gourmet food and a proliferation of cooking-themed TV shows like the Food Network's ""Ace of Cakes"" and Bravo's ""Top Chef."" Plenty of possibilities . Students attending the grueling programs, which can last six to 38 months, can dole out as much as $30,000 to $40,000 for the diploma. And then the real work begins. Neil Robertson, 44, was technical director at a graphic design firm in 2003 and felt like he no longer fit the mold. He quit his 18-year career and attended the French Pastry School in Chicago. ""I've always loved to bake,"" he says. ""But baking in a professional kitchen? I wasn't sure that I could handle it."" In his first professional experience after pastry school, he found out how tough it can be: ""I came very close to tears."" Yet he persevered, and five years later became head pastry chef at Seattle's Canlis restaurant. ""You're not a chef as soon as you finish culinary school,"" says Michael Ruhlman, author of ""The Making of a Chef,"" an inside look at life at the Culinary Institute. ""You're a chef only after spending several years further honing your craft and learning the ropes. To say otherwise would be like saying grads of medical school could instantly be called pediatric neurosurgeons the day after graduation."" And becoming a chef isn't the only option. ""There are so many possibilities today,"" says Culinary Institute President Tim Ryan. ""Catering, sales, manufacturing -- we even have graduates who have launched clothing companies (or) become food scientists."" Jen Beltz, 38, and Thom Householder, 40, testify to that. In 2004, they quit their jobs at AARP and followed their palates to Italy. Using the proceeds of their house sale, the couple attended a five-month culinary program in Florence, then a nine-month course in Canada. All the while, they had no idea where their gastronomic education would take them. ""Some of our friends and family seemed to think we were a bit insane,"" Beltz recalls. But with their newfound culinary know-how, Beltz and Householder launched Front Burner PR, a boutique public-relations and marketing firm in Portland, Maine, that focuses on restaurants, hotels and other food-related clients. Don't quit your day job just yet . Think carefully before writing your resignation letter -- culinary school is no cakewalk, says Robertson. ""It's hot. It's fast. It's high-stress. It's a pressure cooker."" Ruhlman agrees. ""I can't even tell you how many people have read my book and thanked me for saving them from going to culinary school,"" he says, ""because they had no idea how hard it really is."" Before taking the plunge, Robertson and Ruhlman suggest getting a feel for the job via a culinary vacation, like those offered through gourmetontour.com and foodvacation.com, or by shadowing a chef. For the second option, ""go to a restaurant that you like and respect and ask if you can spend a day in the kitchen,"" suggests Ruhlman. It's called trailing, and some restaurants are open to it. If you have some food experience, you might be able to stage (pronounced stauge), which entails working in a kitchen alongside a chef, without pay, for a day or two. ""You get to see what life is really like in a professional kitchen,"" he says, ""and it will really open your eyes."" Looking back, Robertson says leaving his job for the culinary world was a bold move, but worth every deflated soufflé along the way: . ""I'm much more excited about what I'm doing now.""

11,"In the dining room's soft amber glow, dozens of patrons peruse the menu at Rock Creek restaurant in Bethesda, Maryland. From a health standpoint, making a smart choice is easy. Watch your portion size and inquire about the nutritional content of your meal when you eat out. Whether it's the slow-cooked salmon with sesame seeds, warm bok choy salad, and miso mustard dressing or the jumbo lump crab cakes with celeriac-apple slaw and lemon-caper aioli, each meal contains 600 or fewer calories -- nearly half the amount found in a typical restaurant entree. ""We offer what you're supposed to eat -- proper portions, great flavor-and we use fresh, local ingredients as much as possible,"" says co-owner Tom Williams, who, with partner Judith Hammerschmidt, opened Rock Creek two years ago. The pair worked with Cynthia Payne Moore, R.D., a Baltimore, Maryland-based dietitian, to obtain nutritional analyses for every item on the menu, and they adjust recipes to avoid unnecessary fat and determine portion sizes.   ""We put the nutritional information in the back of the menu-people who want to look at it do, and those who don't, don't,"" Hammerschmidt says.   The concept and execution have proved so successful that earlier this year, the pair opened another Rock Creek in Washington, D.C. Enjoying restaurant food like Rock Creek's -- tasty, good for you, and with a reasonable amount of calories -- was once a difficult order to fill. No longer.   ""The idea that eating healthy doesn't mean feeling deprived is something restaurants see as a vehicle for change, as a way to differentiate their offerings from their competitors,"" says Master Chef Mark Erickson, vice president for continuing education at the Culinary Institute of America.   While some restaurants make it clear they offer more healthful fare -- by using symbols, calorie counts, and the like -- others practice what Erickson calls ""stealth health,"" making some healthful changes on the menu without fanfare. ""When restaurants make their menus more healthful, consumers benefit,"" Erickson says. And, in fact, eating well when dining out is a growing trend. Healthfulness on the menu . Part of what's driving these positive changes is consumer demand. Nearly three out of four adults say they are trying to make healthier choices when eating out than they did just two years ago, according to the National Restaurant Association.   ""It's hard to refute that health is related to diet,"" Erickson says. ""And restaurants are making up more and more of the daily diet -- the average American eats one out of three meals away from home."" Increasingly, savvy consumers expect restaurants to have a conscious approach to food preparation similar to the one they use in their own kitchens -- using fruits and vegetables creatively or cooking with less saturated fat or salt. CookingLight.com: Secrets to eating out . Legislative changes are also having an effect. The New York City-initiated ban on trans fats has become far-reaching; at least eight other major metropolitan areas have legislated similar bans, as have restaurants, hotels, theme parks, cruise lines, and many other businesses.   Meanwhile, New York City recently took another stand on upgrading restaurant menus. In a move affecting mostly fast-food restaurants, the city's board of health recently asked food service establishments with standardized preparation methods that already have nutrition analyses to post calorie information on menus so customers can see it when deciding what to order. Many restaurants purposefully take their offerings to a more healthful level. Since he took over the kitchen at the highly regarded Gramercy Tavern in New York City last October, Executive Chef Michael Anthony has created lighter dishes, many of which feature vegetables rather than meat as the plate's centerpiece. ""The goal is to leave consumers feeling invigorated, not lethargic because they've overindulged,"" Anthony says. Like Rock Creek, some restaurants are building their business around a more healthful model. Seasons 52, which has five locations in Florida and two in Atlanta, Georgia, takes a lighter approach to dining by featuring fresh foods that rotate with the seasons and dishes that contain a maximum of 475 calories.   The chefs do this by taking out fat, lowering sugar and salt when possible, and relying instead on flavorful accents such as balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and fruits. ""We call it 'palate distraction,'"" explains Clifford Pleau, director of culinary development. ""If you can give the mouth something else to focus on, it says, 'Wow! I haven't tasted something that interesting before,' instead of 'Wow! Something's missing.'"" CookingLight.com: An expert take on healthful dining-out trends . Tap into the trend . ""While restaurants are becoming more health-conscious, it's only going to keep happening if people ask for it,"" says Katherine Tallmadge, R.D., a Washington, D.C.-based spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Here's how to support the trend while ordering sensibly: . • Do a little homework. ""If you decide ahead of time what you want to order, it will eliminate temptation while you are at the restaurant,"" Tallmadge says. Many national chains post nutrition analyses on their Web sites, so you can find out how much fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, and calories a potential meal contains. Healthydiningfinder.com, a Web site operated by the National Restaurant Association, can help you pinpoint nutritious fare at nearly 30,000 restaurants across the country -- enter your ZIP code or your city, and you can search for restaurants by cuisine or price range. • Watch portion size. Prodigious entrees remain common in many restaurants, despite other changes for the better. Because patrons tend to place a premium on value -- they want to feel as if they're getting their money's worth -- piled-high plates aren't likely to become a relic of the past anytime soon.   ""You can negotiate such situations by having part of your meal boxed to take home, downsizing your order by selecting an appetizer and side salad instead of an entree, or splitting the entree with someone,"" says Dawn Jackson Blatner, R.D., a Chicago, Illinois-based ADA spokesperson. CookingLight.com: How to practice portion control . • Sample small plates. Tapas-sized servings -- i.e. small plates -- will continue to be in fashion in coming years, according to Restaurant Startup Consultants, Inc., which counsels new food service businesses. Small plates allow you to sample a variety of dishes without consuming too many calories. In addition to high-end restaurants, the trend is also appearing in some national chains. In March, TGI Friday's unveiled a new Right Portion, Right Price menu, offering smaller portions of certain entrees that contain 500 calories or less and 10 grams of fat or less per serving. CookingLight.com: Tapas at home . • Choose seasonal ingredients. A less-is-more approach governs the preparation of fresh, seasonal ingredients: They're often minimally dressed or sauced, allowing fresh flavors to play the starring role. Look for items like spinach and roasted beet salad or roasted butternut squash on fall menus.   ""If you have a high-quality meat, fish, or vegetable that has a great deal of flavor, you don't need to eat a lot of it to feel satisfied,"" says Hugo Matheson, chef-owner of the Kitchen Café, who practices this principle at his Boulder, Colorado, restaurant. CookingLight.com: Ultimate summer cookbook . • Select healthful sides. These days, healthful sides, ranging from steamed broccoli to grilled asparagus to sautéed spinach with garlic, have more space on restaurant menus. ""The idea that you can have an indulgent entree but improve your sides is something I enjoy because it's a small change,"" Blatner says. ""If you make small steps to improve what you eat, you'll be healthier for it."" • Look for balance. Chefs and restaurateurs are reexamining the fundamentals of their offerings. At Seasons 52, for example, each entree plate is made up of one-third protein and two-thirds fruits, vegetables, and starches. Others are practicing what the Culinary Institute refers to as ""the protein flip.""   ""Finer dining establishments are flipping the traditional plating concept. Vegetables and carbohydrates are the main component, and protein is secondary,"" Erickson says. • Ask questions. When ordering, inquire about the meal's composition or preparation. ""Go to restaurants where the people serving the food know what the ingredients are,"" Pleau says. For example, Rock Creek uses phyllo instead of traditional lard-laced dough in its piecrusts; but unless you ask them, you won't know that you can enjoy a slice of their pie and avoid unnecessary saturated fat and calories. • Enjoy yourself. While we're all eating out more often these days, consider a restaurant meal to be a treat. Savor the flavors, and select dishes you can't or wouldn't make in your own kitchen. ""Look at the meal as a source of pleasure,"" Anthony says. ""The key is to relish the experience -- within moderation."" For more tips on making healthy taste great, try Cooking Light - CLICK HERE .

12,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York's iconic Plaza Hotel will lose a figure nearly as synonymous with it as Eloise when its longest-serving doorman retires Thursday after 46 years on the job. Ed Trinka, whose retirement coincides with his 65th birthday, joined the hotel 1963. Ed Trinka, whose retirement coincides with his 65th birthday, joined the hotel's staff in 1963 as a teenager. He spent 40 years at the fabled lodging's Fifth Avenue entrance, relocating to its doorway facing Central Park South during the property's renovation and partial conversion to condominiums several years ago. Now as much a Central Park South fixture as the horse-drawn carriages that line the park's southern perimeter, the gregarious Trinka is known as the ""mayor of 59th Street."" On a recent afternoon, he seemed to know every other passerby, exchanging a constant stream of hellos with chauffeurs and doormen from adjacent tony apartment buildings and, of course, the Plaza's residents. Over his more than four decades manning the Plaza's entrance, Trinka has met countless celebrities -- or ""all of them,"" as he puts it. After his first celebrity encounter at the hotel with the Beatles, he's catered to a long procession of big names, including Joe DiMaggio, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Liza Minnelli. Marla Maples, ex-wife of one-time Plaza owner Donald Trump, would regularly peck Trinka on the cheek when she saw him. Trinka says he has an autographed photo of Richard Nixon -- a token of gratitude from the former president -- hanging on proud display at his home. Trinka says he has thoroughly enjoyed his lengthy stay at the portal to history and glamour. ""I never had a bad day in all the years."" Nonetheless, with all those years at the hotel under his belt, Trinka felt it was time to ""bow out gracefully."" As he transitions to retirement, Trinka says he'll miss the front-row view of Central Park and the hotel's clientele -- the ""greatest people in the world."" He also concedes he'll miss ""the women."" The building's inhabitants are not eager for his departure. ""He's a gentleman, refined -- you don't find these people anymore,"" lamented resident Joan Spain. Trinka's replacement, Jimmy O'Connell, is keenly aware of the large shoes he'll have to fill, saying he'd be satisfied if he ""could be half the doorman"" Trinka is. The hotel will bid farewell to Trinka in characteristically grand fashion on Thursday afternoon. After a champagne send-off in the hotel's landmarked Oak Room, its management will present him with an opportunity to view the Plaza from the vantage point of the countless guests he's greeted over the years: He'll be given a free stay at the hotel. In addition to a trove of anecdotes about celebrities, Trinka acquired something else during his tenure at the Plaza: a new name. Years ago, the hotel gave him a nametag that mistakenly read Edward, even though his full name is Edwin. He came to embrace the errant nametag, neglecting to correct people when they called him Edward and even naming his own son Edward.",0.6255981,3553

14,"(Mental Floss) -- It's hard to walk down the aisle of a liquor store without running across a bottle bearing someone's name. A costumed reveler at a Captain Morgan party celebrates the rum named after the 17th century privateer. We put them in our cocktails, but how well do we know them? Here's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples: . 1. Captain Morgan . The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama. He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame . 2. Johnnie Walker . Walker, the name behind the world's most popular brand of Scotch whisky, was born in 1805 in Ayrshire, Scotland. When his father died in 1819, Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds, which the trustees invested in a grocery store. Walker became a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky, Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky. Johnnie's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men, though. Alexander had spent time in Glasgow learning how to blend teas, but he eventually returned to Kilmarnock to take over the grocery from his father. Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky, and came up with ""Old Highland Whisky,"" which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label. 3. Jack Daniel . Jasper Newton ""Jack"" Daniel of Tennessee whiskey fame was the descendant of Welsh settlers who came to the United States in the early 19th century. He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children. By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Unfortunately for the distiller, he had a bit of a temper. One morning in 1911 Daniel showed up for work early and couldn't get his safe open. He flew off the handle and kicked the offending strongbox. The kick was so ferocious that Daniel injured his toe, which then became infected. The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul. Curious about why your bottle of J.D. also has Lem Motlow listed as the distillery's proprietor? Daniel's own busy life of distilling and safe-kicking kept him from ever finding a wife and siring an heir, so in 1907 he gave the distillery to his beloved nephew Lem Motlow, who had come to work for him as a bookkeeper. Mental Floss: The many myths of Jack Daniel . 4. Jose Cuervo . In 1758, Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico. Jose used his agave plants to make mescal, a popular Mexican liquor. In 1795, King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo. Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila, so they built a larger factory on the existing land. The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880, and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo. The brand is still under the leadership of the original Jose Cuervo's family; current boss Juan-Domingo Beckmann is the sixth generation of Cuervo ancestors to run the company. 5. Jim Beam . Jim Beam, the namesake of the world's best-selling bourbon whiskey, didn't actually start the distillery that now bears his name. His great-grandfather Jacob Beam opened the distillery in 1788 and started selling his first barrels of whiskey in 1795. In those days, the whiskey went by the less-catchy moniker of ""Old Tub."" Jacob Beam handed down the distillery to his son David Beam, who in turn passed it along to his son David M. Beam, who eventually handed the operation off to his son, Colonel James Beauregard Beam, in 1894. Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business, Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down. Following repeal in 1933, Jim quickly built a distillery and began resurrecting the Old Tub brand, but he also added something new to the company's portfolio: a bourbon simply called Jim Beam. Mental Floss: A bourbon FAQ . 6. Tanqueray . When he was a young boy, Charles Tanqueray's path through life seemed pretty clear. He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen, so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself. Wrong. Instead, he started distilling gin in 1830 in a little plant in London's Bloomsbury district. By 1847, he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire, where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic. 7. Campari . Gaspare Campari found his calling quickly. By the time he was 14, he had risen to become a master drink mixer in Turin, Italy, and in this capacity he started dabbling with a recipe for an aperitif. When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture, his concoction had over 60 ingredients. In 1860, he founded Gruppo Campari to make his trademark bitters in Milan. Like Colonel Sanders' spice blend, the recipe for Campari is a closely guarded secret supposedly known by only the acting Gruppo Campari chairman, who works with a tiny group of employees to make the concentrate with which alcohol and water are infused to get Campari. The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari's recipe, though, which includes quinine, orange peel, rhubarb, and countless other flavorings. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

Robert and Alison Smith, the owners of the Anstrhuther Fishbar  in Fife, celebrate their success. The UK is in recession, but the nation's traditional takeaway dish is showing no sign of a downturn. Sales rose at 9,500 chippies in Britain by 1.7 percent last year, according to Seafish, a seafood industry group. The Anstrhuther Fishbar in Fife, Scotland was crowned the best chippy of 2008 following a rigorous selection procedure that included a customer vote, taste tests and two intense rounds of shop inspections. ""Fish and chip shops are well-placed to prosper in the current economic climate as they offer value for money and a quality product with a feel-good factor,"" competition judge Andy Gray said. ""Despite the credit crunch, people still want to enjoy small luxuries. Fish and chips are a national institution which have survived the test of time and will be around for many years to come."" Fishbar owner Robert Smith said that the start of 2009 had been the busiest January since the harbor front shop opened in 2003. Smith, who also owns a fish processing business, said dedication was the key to the shop's success. ""We are passionate about our business and we just do it right,"" he said. Fish and chips is the most popular hot takeaway in Britain, with 276 million meals eaten every year, according to Seafish figures.",0.60988545,2199
17,"(CNN) -- The fiberglass head weighed 600 pounds and resembled Clarabell the Clown from the 1950s ""Howdy Doody Show."" Bill Ziegler, owner of the Wild Bill's nostalgia store, stumbled across it on an artist's Web site and wondered if it would work for a project he had in mind. Salem Sue stands watch in New Salem, North Dakota. She measures 38 feet tall and 50 feet long. Ziegler recruited the artist to help him attach the giant head to his 33-foot farm silo. By October 2008, the pair had built the world's largest jack-in-the-box. The jack-in-the-box extends 50 feet in the air, moving up and down approximately once a minute. ""They love it,"" Ziegler said of the tourists who come to his store. He's had visitors from as far away as England -- one couple who saw the story of the jack-in-the-box in a British newspaper decided to stop by. All across the country, roadside attractions like this one bring surprise and delight to travelers who just have to get a closer look. ""In many parts of the country, you can plan an entire road trip where you visit nothing but 'world's largest' attractions,"" said Doug Kirby, the publisher of RoadsideAmerica.com. Kirby's Web site pays homage to odd attractions -- from Ziegler's jack-in-the-box in Middletown, Connecticut, to the world's largest ketchup bottle in Collinsville, Illinois, to the world's largest sundial in Carefree, Arizona. ""Travelers enjoy the noncorporate, somewhat ragged nature of these eclectic attractions,"" Kirby said. ""They're often free, and you can take a great 'wish you were here' photo.""  See photos of some ""world's largest"" attractions » . Kirby picked five world's largest attractions from his Web site. In addition to Ziegler's jack-in-the-box, here are his top recommendations for adventurous road trippers: . Ball of twine . Visitors do more than snap a picture at the world's largest ball of twine in Cawker City, Kansas. Linda Clover, self-described keeper of the ball, gives tourists twine to add it to the attraction. ""People like to be a part of it,"" Clover said. ""It shows that with lots of patience and a lot of people helping out, you can end up with something very big."" Clover ended up in charge of the ball in a roundabout way. Farmer Frank Stoeber started the ball of twine in 1953. When he died, his cousin took over. And when his cousin died, Clover stepped up. ""I know that people like to come and see it. And someone had to take care of it,"" she said. ""My husband used to say that people asked me to do something and I couldn't say no."" Clover keeps twine with her in case an interested tourist gives her a call. The ball measures more than 40 feet across. It contains 7.9 million feet of twine and weighs approximately 19,000 pounds. And every year in August, Cawker City hosts a twine-a-thon event to hold on to the world's largest ball of twine record. Salem Sue . Salem Sue, dubbed the world's largest cow, is in New Salem, North Dakota. She measures 38 feet tall, 50 feet long and is made up of 12,000 pounds of fiberglass. Scott Schauer, producer of The Real North Dakota project, features Salem Sue on his Web site, which is dedicated to showing tourists the best of North Dakota. As a kid, Schauer used to drive by the cow with his family. He thinks many people pass similar road trip traditions on to their kids, hence their appeal. ""I remember being mesmerized by their monstrous size. No matter how many times I saw them, I always looked forward to seeing them again and again,"" Schauer said. ""As an adult, I still look forward to seeing them. I guess some things don't change with time."" Horseshoe crab . The world's largest horseshoe crab resides in a parking lot at the Freedom Worship Baptist Church in Blanchester, Ohio. Last year, the church's pastor, Jim Rankin, hired Evel Knievel's former bodyguard to jump over the crab on his motorcycle. The publicity stunt attracted nearly 8,000 visitors to the church. The crab is 68 feet long from its head to its long, spiky tail. ""It can have up to 65 people inside,"" Rankin said. Peanut . In the 1970s, Ashburn, Georgia, built a monument to the state's No. 1 cash crop. Standing atop a brick tower along Interstate 75, the world's largest peanut can be seen for miles. The peanut is 33 feet tall with a 10-foot circumference. The peanut was featured on a Go-Gurt portable yogurt packet as a trivia question, said Shelley Zorn, Ashburn's chamber of commerce president. It also showed up on a Food Network show. ""Hilarious, isn't it?"" Zorn said of the public's love affair with the peanut. ""I can meet people on a cruise ... and I ask them if they've seen it. Nine out of 10 people have seen that peanut, no matter where they're from."" A legacy . Recognition is the main reason people build the world's largest attractions, Kirby said. His site rates places higher if they surprise his staff or make them laugh. iReport.com: See the ""world's largest rocking chair"" ""Towns build giant statues to promote themselves and take pride in local heroes, historic figures or industries,"" Kirby said. ""Businesses commission creation of giants so they stand out from their competition. For individuals, a 'world's largest' something may be a hobby gone out of control. ... Creators fret about their legacy. This 'world's largest' may be how the world remembers them."" That is, until someone builds a bigger one.",0.6024467,3579
18,"(Mental Floss) -- Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country. Not all food items are always listed on restaurant menus. Be warned, this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol. We've compiled a list to get you started. 1. If you're at Starbucks and in need of just a little caffeine, don't worry -- there's a tiny option for you. It's the Short size, and they don't advertise it. It's like a little baby cup of coffee. It also comes in handy when you're scrounging for change and don't have enough for a tall (not that that has ever happened to me). 2. It's a good thing we don't have Jamba Juice here in Iowa, because I would be all over candy-based smoothies. Because it's considered a health-food chain, Jamba Juice doesn't officially list these on their in-store menus, but the Web site Mighty Foods assures us that the secret flavors exist. The ones they confirmed with the company's headquarters include Strawberry Shortcake, White Gummy Bear, PB&J, Various flavors of Starbursts, Fruity Pebbles, Push-Up Pops, and Skittles. Other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist: Chocolate Gummi Bear, Apple Pie, Sourpatch Kid, Tootsie Roll, and Now and Later. 3. This one might be my favorite. At Fatburger, you can order a Hypocrite -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon. 4. Chipotle has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available, they will make it for you. Things that have been tested include nachos, quesadillas, taco salads and single tacos. Some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item, however, so maybe someday soon you won't need a super-secret handshake to order one. Mental Floss: 7 food promotions gone horribly wrong . 5. If you're at Wendy's and you're really hungry -- like, three-patties-just-won't-cut-it hungry -- go ahead and order the Grand Slam, which is four patties stacked on a bun. This option is only available at select Wendy's, and it's also known as the Meat Cube. 6. Several places, including McDonald's and In-N-Out, will serve you the Neapolitan milkshake. It's just what it sounds like -- chocolate, vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup. 7. In-N-Out Burger's ""secret menu"" isn't so secret these days -- in fact, they've posted it on their Web site. But in case you're not in the habit of surfing fast food Web sites, here's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items: ordering something ""Animal Style"" at In-N-Out means you're going to get it with lettuce, tomato, a mustard-cooked beef patty, pickles, extra spread (it's sort of Thousand-Islandy) and grilled onions. You can even get your fries Animal Style. Mental Floss: Why is it called ""Thousand Island"" dressing? ""Protein Style"" is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun. A Grilled Cheese is two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato and spread on a bun (grilled onions if you so choose). And you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you're ordering lumber: 3×3 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese, 4×4 gets you four of each, and so on. According to photos posted at SuperSizedMeals.com, one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a Las Vegas store a few years ago. One item not listed on the Web site secret menu: the Flying Dutchman, which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties, hold the bun. 8. Feeling a little health-conscious at Popeye's? If you are, you really should have gone somewhere else. But there's a little hope for you -- ordering ""naked chicken"" will get you breading-free poultry. The word is that this is on the menu at some Popeye's, but not all of them, although it is an option at all of them. 9. Like Chipotle, Taco Bell will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it. Since most of the food at Taco Bell is made out of the same basic items, that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them. One ""secret,"" though, is that they have a not-advertised green chili sauce at most locations, and apparently it's excellent. 10. Some Subways will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s. Once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating, the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places (the word is that Canadian and Mexican Subways still offer them on a regular basis). But if you ask, lots of places will still make it for you. Be warned, though -- Jared would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce.

20,"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Since he opened his first restaurant in the heart of Beverly Hills in the early eighties, Wolfgang Puck has gone on to become a household name in the U.S. Puck says L.A. has perfect weather, ""fabulous light and very little rain"" His chain of airport restaurants stretch across the states while his brand adorns everything from pizzas to non-stick pans. He lives in Los Angeles with his second wife and their two young children. CNN: What first drew you to L.A.? Wolfgang Puck: I came to the U.S. when I was 24. I spent a month in New York and a year in Indianapolis but I always dreamt about the beaches in California. I had a blue 1967 Cadillac. In 1974 I packed my suitcases, put them in a trailer and drove straight to L.A. It took me five days to drive from Indianapolis.  Watch Wolfgang Puck take CNN on a tour of L.A. » . CNN: What has kept you here all these years? Wolfgang Puck: In L.A. you live in a big city, but you feel like you're in the countryside. For example, I can be at home in the swimming pool and be five minutes from everything. It has the perfect weather -- the movie industry started here because of the fabulous light and very little rain. See pictures of Wolfgang Puck's Los Angeles . CNN: Does everyone in L.A. want to be an actor? Wolfgang Puck: It's a city of dreams. It's nice to dream but a lot of people forget it's very difficult. They think you become Cate Blanchett or Jack Nicholson just like that, but these people paid their dues. They forget how much time it took them to get there and how good they really are. CNN: You are the official caterer to the Oscars. It must an exciting event to be part of. Wolfgang Puck: When we cater the Governor's Ball, we have 300 people in the kitchen and 600 in the dining room. It goes very fast and it's done the right way. I remember Michael Caine came to Spago (Puck's flagship Beverly Hills eaterie) the Monday after the awards with his family and said could he get the same dish that he ate at the awards, which means we really nailed it. CNN: How has the city inspired your cooking? Wolfgang Puck: For me, cooking is an expression of the land where you are and the culture of that place. L.A. is a melting pot of many different cultures and we have fabulous ingredients here. If you go to San Diego, San Francisco you can get the best vegetables, the best fruits, sea food -- all these wonderful ingredients. CNN: How does L.A. compare with New York? Wolfgang Puck: New Yorkers think they have everything, all the best art and music. But really L.A. is a better place. Some of the most famous artists in the world work right here. CNN: You're a big fan of modern art. How did that start? Wolfgang Puck: I got interested in contemporary art because I worked in a restaurant right across the street from a gallery where they made prints for people like David Hockney. The artists came for lunch at the restaurant so I used to talk to them. Hockney made the first cover of my cook book; I had Andy Warhol do the label for our wine. I feel that painting is in some way like cooking -- if you add a little more blue, a little less blue it doesn't matter. The same thing with cooking: a little of this, a little bit more of that. As long as the end result is beautiful, that's what counts. CNN: If L.A. was personified, what would they be like? Wolfgang Puck: A person who enjoys themselves. They do a great job at work but also can have a good time. To me that's what life is all about.",0.5934808,9206

22,"Vacaville, California (CNN) -- You might think green eggs are only found in a Dr. Seuss classic. But at a small, family-run and highly regarded chicken farm on the outskirts of the San Francisco, they're a relatively common sight. ""Isn't that beautiful?"" said Soul Food Farm owner Alexis Koefed as she held one of the green gems. ""The thing about farm eggs is, once you've had them you can't go back to the store and buy eggs again,"" she said. Chickens at the Soul Food Farm roam freely around the farm's 50 acres. They enjoy vast fields of natural grass and generally live a stress-free life, feasting freely. It's a philosophy unlike that of the industrial chicken farm, and Koefed and her loyal customers believe it produces better eggs and chicken. Soul Food Farm's rise to popularity wasn't limited to locals and the farmer's market regulars. Instead, Koefed's methods attracted the attention of many of the Bay Area's top restaurants and their celebrity chefs, including Alice Waters of the nationally renowned Chez Panise in Berkeley. But an overnight fire in September 2009 raced down the rolling hills surrounding the farm nearly put an end to it. By the time it was extinguished, much of the farm and some 1,200 chicks had perished. With the existence of Soul Food Farm at stake, determined friends, neighbors and loyal customers of the Koefeds came to the rescue. ""It was so inspiring and heartwarming, Koefed said. ""It was a wonderful feeling to know that people cared about the farm as much as I did."" Friend Bonnie Powell organized a fundraising effort of raffles, silent auctions, and dinners. She helped raise $30,000 to build new coops and replace the chicks killed in the fire. ""You can't hear something like that and just go, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry that this thing you have worked so hard for is done and there's nothing anyone can do about it,'"" Powell said. Through the intrepid determination and loyal commitment of a true community, Soul Food Farm is  back on the map.",0.5861777,9423

The first state dinner of Barack Obama's presidency, in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, will take place in a tent set up on the White House South Lawn, with a view of the Washington Monument. Guests will sit at round tables for 10, with the floral arrangements intended to pay homage to the state bird of India, the Indian peacock, and the dinner featuring a seasonal menu reflecting American and Indian flavors, according to the White House. The first course will be a potato and eggplant salad made with White House-grown arugula and accompanied by an onion-seed vinaigrette. Red lentil soup with fresh cheese follows, and then a choice of entrees: roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chickpeas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns and caramelized salsify with smoked collard greens. Dessert will be pumpkin pie tart or pear tatin with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Each course is paired with its own wine, all of American vintage. Michelle Obama worked with guest chef Marcus Samuelsson and White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford to ""create a menu that reflects the best of American cuisine, continues this White House's commitment to serving fresh, sustainable and regional food, and honors the culinary excellence and flavors that are present in Indian cuisine,"" the White House said.

24,"(Mental Floss) -- People have been eating pickles ever since the Mesopotamians started making them way back in 2400 B.C.E. Here are some even more important things you should know about them. Pickles have gotten credit for health and beauty and winning football games. 1. In the Pacific Islands, natives pickle their foods in holes in the ground lined with banana leaves, and use them as food reserves in case of storms. The pickles are so valuable that they've become part of the courting process, helping a man prove he'll be able to provide for a woman. In Fiji, guys can't get a girl without first showing her parents his pickle pits. 2. Cleopatra claimed pickles made her beautiful. (We guess it had more to do with her genes.) 3. The majority of pickle factories in America ferment their pickles in outdoor vats without lids (leaving them subject to insects and bird droppings). But there's a reason. According to food scientists, the sun's direct rays prevent yeast and mold from growing in the brine. Mental Floss: 8 disastrous product names . 4. In the Delta region of Mississippi, Kool-Aid pickles have become ridiculously popular with kids. The recipe's simple: take some dill pickles, cut them in half, and then soak them in super strong Kool-Aid for more than a week. According to the New York Times, the sweet vinegar snacks are known to sell out at fairs and delicatessens, and generally go for $.50 to a $1. 5. Not everyone loves a sweet pickle. In America, dill pickles are twice as popular as the sweet variety. 6. The Department of Agriculture estimates that the average American eats 8.5 lbs of pickles a year. 7. When the Philadelphia Eagles thrashed the Dallas Cowboys in sweltering heat in September 2000, many of the players attributed their win to one thing: guzzling down immense quantities of ice-cold pickle juice. Mental Floss: 31 unbelievable high school mascots . 8. If it weren't for pickles, Christopher Columbus might never have ""discovered"" America. In his famous 1492 voyage, Columbus rationed pickles to his sailors to keep them from getting scurvy. He even grew cucumbers during a pit stop in Haiti to restock for the rest of the voyage. 9. Speaking of people who get credit for discovering America, when he wasn't drawing maps and trying to steal Columbus' thunder, Amerigo Vespucci was a well-known pickle-merchant. 10. Napoleon was also a big fan of pickle power. In fact, he put up the equivalent of $250,000 as a prize to whoever could figure out the best way to pickle and preserve foods for his troops. 11. During the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, H. J. Heinz used pick-shaped pins to lure customers to his out of the way booth. By the end of the fair, he'd given out lots of free food, and over 1,000,000 pickle pins. 12. Berrien Springs, Michigan, has dubbed itself the Christmas Pickle Capital of the World. In early December, they host a parade, led by the Grand Dillmeister, who tosses out fresh pickles to parade watchers. Mental Floss: Curious, bizarre and storied state symbols .

26,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The ""crime scene cookies"", ""baaji custard"" and ""sponge shafts"" depicted in Oliver Beale's letter of complaint to Virgin Atlantic struck a chord worldwide. Mean cuisine? Airline industry experts insist standards of in-flight food are improving. The missive he sent to Virgin chairman Sir Richard Branson about a meal he received on board a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London in December spread across the web and email with a vengeance. Not only was this a complaint letter par excellence, but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long-haul air travel: the in-flight meal. Read the letter here. ""Food gets everybody going, whether they are sitting at the back end or the front end of the plane,"" says Peter Miller, marketing director at Skytrax, a UK-based aviation research organization. ""Apart from the sheer fact you might be hungry, it is there to alleviate the boredom. Because of that people tend to focus on it more."" But the criticism passengers target at airline food is not always warranted, Miller argues. Skytrax has been tracking airline service for a decade and every year it ranks airlines according to catering in economy, business and first class. Miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short-haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long-haul economy. But Skytrax's research has also revealed a general improvement in standards over the last five years. ""We are actually strong supporters of the overall quality that is served up across most airlines in most parts of the world,"" says Miller. Standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies, says Miller. What do you think? Are in-flight meals getting better or worse? What was your worse meal? Sound off below. Austrian catering company DO & CO has transformed the food served onboard Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines flights. Skytrax reported a 35 percent increase in customer satisfaction for Turkish Airlines since DO & CO was hired in 2007. ""In the last 15-20 years, the industry has focused on lean production. But we believe [airline catering] is not the job of a car manufacturer,"" says Attila Dogudan, CEO of DO & CO. Good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine. ""If you have chefs doing 3,000 filets on the grill, after 300 they lose the passion,"" says Dogudan. To inspire enthusiasm in its kitchens, DO & CO says it employs an unusually high ratio of chefs to work on a greater variety of dishes. They say they also insist on training cabin staff in food service; they replace the dreaded disposable food trays with crockery; and give passengers menus explaining where their fresh, local ingredients come from. Airlines also use food as a marketing tool and improve standards to attract premium customers. Austrian Airlines has won the Skytrax award for Best Business Class Catering for the last two years. As Michael Braun, spokesman at Austrian Airlines says, ""the current situation in the airline industry is tough and costs have to be cut. But the competition is also very tough, so we need something that makes us unique compared to other airlines."" And for Austrian Airlines, one unique selling point is its food. There is an on-board chef on every Austrian Airlines flight who puts the crucial finishing touches on premium-class meals. The airline also offers a ""Vienna coffee house in the air"" and one quarter of flight attendants are trained sommeliers to guide passengers through the extensive wine list. Airlines worldwide also hire celebrity chefs to add prestige to their culinary efforts. British chef, Gordon Ramsay is one of Singapore Airline's ""Culinary Panel""; Juan Amador works with Lufthansa; and United Airlines enlisted the services of U.S. chef Charlie Trotter to inspire its in-flight menu. Chefs help airlines design meals that perform at high altitude. As Michelle Bernstein, Delta's celebrity chef has said, palates weaken in pressurized air cabins, which means dishes need to be made a more flavorful and seasoned than they would be on the ground. Miller at SkyTrax is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering. After all, Gordon Ramsay isn't actually in the cabin sautéing the potatoes. But he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in-flight cuisine. Chef Neil Perry, hired by Qantas in 2003, initiated a move to healthy eating in first and business class. His work has since influenced standards across catering in all classes. Qantas won the Skytrax award for Best Economy Class Catering in 2008 partly as a result of simple enhancements such as the availability of fresh fruit between meals and from the self-serve bar in economy on its A380 aircraft. But as airlines grapple with a deepening recession, can passengers expect treats to vanish from food trays? Across short-haul flights, making cuts is an ""easier game,"" says Miller. Passengers notice it far less if an airline switches a sandwich for a packet of biscuits and a plastic cup of coffee, he says. But on long-haul flights, airlines are restrained in what they can cut. Miller: ""People measure the standard of their flight by the quality of the food or the size of the portion they get. If a meal is cut back too severely they are going to walk away.""

27,"(CNN) -- Celebrity chef Bobby Chinn has tried his hand at a number of things. Chinn's face for television: Picking up his Asian TV Award in 2007. English boarding school taught him that food could be an awful experience; Wall Street taught him that creativity was more important than money and a stint as a stand-up comedian taught him that you can't always get it right. Half Chinese, half Egyptian, Chinn's grandmothers were his first introduction to the variety and pleasure that food can bring. While his palate was subdued by the meals he was given at school in England when he was a boy, his meandering route to becoming a chef came some time after attaining a degree in Finance and Economics. Moving to New York after graduating he worked on Wall Street. ""You didn't produce anything at the end of a day and you didn't breathe fresh air, you didn't know what the weather was like outside because you were on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It's like the dungeon of capitalism where time and money met,"" he told CNN's Talk Asia. Chinn escaped ""the dungeon"" after a year and a half to the sunny climes of California, but it wasn't to laze around. An addiction to high-octane and challenging environments saw Chinn explore the possibility of being a stand-up comic. ""I was always afraid to talk in front of the class and now I am trying to make them laugh"" he told CNN. ""One day you are really funny and then you go to another gig the same night and nobody laughs and then at the same time you are living a life of poverty. When you are bombing as a comic I don't think there can be a worse life."" While finding out the hard way how funny, or not, he was, Chinn was working front-of-house in restaurants, nurturing his love of food. His break came when Hubert Keller from San Francisco restaurant Fleur de Lys took him on as a volunteer in his kitchen. ""He gave me a job and after one week he said 'OK, you can stay.' And then when you work with one really great chef, then I think you can work anywhere,"" he said. After also training with chefs in France, Chinn made his own mark on the culinary world when he opened his first restaurant in Vietnam in 1995, and at first found the going tough. ""Supplies were not consistent, the language barrier, the taste barrier, the hygiene barriers. Those are very taxing on a person like me with very little patience."" A high-energy chef and now a TV celebrity who presents ""World Café Asia"" -- he won an Asian Television Award in 2007 -- Chinn is aware that being flavor of the month on TV is transitory. ""It is just a machine that feeds on people like me and then spits me out when my time is done. You just have to go with the flow.""",0.56998706,919
28,"(CNN) -- At the stroke of midnight, American beer drinkers were no longer breaking the law when they broke open a beer. Brewers and beer lovers this weekend are toasting the return of legal brew 75 years ago. Breweries and beer lovers around the country are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the return of beer on April 7, 1933, as the Prohibition era was drawing to a close. It wasn't quite the end of Prohibition, and it wasn't quite beer, but after 14 thirsty years, it was close enough. What became available that day was only 3.2 percent alcohol by weight (compared with up to 5 percent in full-strength beer), but still, it was a step up from the virtually alcohol-free ""near beer"" that had been sold since 1920. ""It's a big deal. ... The whole industry of beer has gotten together to say this date is definitely historic,"" said Julia Herz, spokeswoman for the Brewers Association, which represents smaller ""craft"" brewers. In St. Louis, Missouri, megabrewer Anheuser-Busch is throwing a big bash, complete with historical exhibits and an appearance by the company's famous Clydesdale horses. Also in St. Louis, but on a more intimate scale, Schlafly Beer is inviting folks to come out to its Bottleworks for a festival next weekend. Remnants of Prohibition survive today in the form of state-owned liquor stores and local laws that, for example, prevent sales of alcohol on Sundays or in grocery stores. Some counties remain entirely dry, banning alcohol sales altogether, and 3.2 beer is still sold in six states (Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma and Utah), according to Modern Brewery Age magazine. And there are those who think a beer-related anniversary is nothing to celebrate. ""It is the product of choice for underage drinking,"" said Michael Scippa, advocacy director for the Marin Institute, an alcohol industry watchdog group. ""We're not neo-Prohibitionists or teetotalers,"" he said. ""We're not trying to tell adults what to do. "" He said his group just wants the industry to operate more responsibly. The crowds celebrating the anniversary are unlikely to match the size or enthusiasm of those that gathered around breweries all over the country on ""New Beer's Eve,"" April 6, 1933, in anticipation of the return of legal beer that actually had some alcohol in it. ""There was dancing in the streets and lines outside brewery doors ... It was a big date, for sure,"" Herz said. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had been president barely a month, having been sworn in on March 4 after a landslide victory the previous November. Sweeping into power with him was an anti-Prohibition majority in Congress known as ""the wets."" Together they fulfilled their first campaign promise with passage of the Cullen-Harrison Act, which increased the amount of alcohol allowed in beverages from 0.5 percent to a discernible 3.2 percent by weight. When the act took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET April 7, trucks and carriages burst out of brewery gates bearing cases and barrels of beer for a parched republic -- at least for the District of Columbia and the 20 states whose laws permitted it. Several breweries dispatched cases directly to the White House and the Capitol. According to the Brewers Association, more than 1.5 million barrels were snapped up in the first 24 hours. Full-strength beer and hard liquor were still a few months away. National Prohibition wasn't repealed until the 21st Amendment to the Constitution was ratified on December 5. Bob Skilnik, author of eight books about beer, including ""Beer & Food: An American History,"" holds that the December date is more significant and that the quickly brewed April 7 beer probably was of poor quality. ""I know everyone gets excited about it, but you were offered a watered-down version of beer. That's all you got,"" Skilnik said. ""It probably wasn't a very satisfying drink. If you wanted to have a shot [of hard liquor] on the side, you still had to wait until December 5th for that to happen."" But the celebration was about more than getting a buzz. According to a contemporary article in The New York Times, the revival of the brewing industry restored at least 50,000 jobs in the midst of the Great Depression, instantly breathing life into the economies of St. Louis; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Chicago, Illinois; and other cities and towns where breweries were large employers. ""April 7th was really just ... FDR looking for an economic shot in the arm,"" Skilnik said. ""And it was a very successful shot in the arm. There was a hell of a lot of money spent."" He said $25 million was pumped into breweries and associated businesses -- helping farmers, truckers, and glassmakers as well as brewers and pubs -- in the first 48 hours of sales. And that was good for cash-strapped governments, too. ""Everybody [in government], for the first time, started to wrap their heads around the notion that this is something that you could tax,"" he said. The first day of beer sales reaped $7.5 million in tax receipts for the U.S. Treasury, he noted. About half the nation's breweries went out of business during Prohibition, but others survived by converting to products such as oleomargarine, ice cream, cheese and smoked ham. So at the Storck brewery in Milwaukee, for example, children could enjoy a sundae while Mom or Dad slipped away to a room where illicit beer was served from a hidden tap, according to the American Brewerania Association's Web site. Yes, despite Prohibition, Americans could go for the gusto. Chicago had as many as 20,000 speakeasies, Skilnik said. ""If you couldn't find a beer during Prohibition,"" he said, ""you really weren't trying."" E-mail to a friend .",0.56706345,9816
29,"If you're like us, you eat out more than ever -- and, as nice as it is to not have to cook, those meals out can actually feel like work. How do you navigate the minefields of huge portions, hidden fats, and sky-high sodium levels? Olive Garden's Venetian Apricot Chicken has 448 calories and 11 grams of fat. You shouldn't have to resign yourself to paying for restaurant meals with a future cardiac risk. You just need to know where to go to find healthy, fresh food. To that end, we went out into the world of sit-down restaurants, looking to separate the (whole) wheat from the chaff. Backed by an advisory panel of experts in healthy dining, we sifted through 43 chains with more than 75 locations across the country and, frankly, were astonished by how many restaurants made no nutritional information available. Health.com: Meet Health's experts . But judge we did those brave (and progressive) enough to share their numbers. What you hold in your hands are the 10 that stood at the top of the heap. Uno's Chicago Grill . If you haven't been to your local Uno's recently, you're in for a great surprise. Sure, its famous deep-dish (read high-fat) pizzas still hold court, but nutrition has become the word of the day with a completely transfat-free menu and plenty of grilled entrees (including antibiotic-free chicken). Adding to the healthy variety: whole-grain pasta and brown rice, organic coffee and tea, and flatbread pizzas that have half the calories of deep-dish ones. Plus, you can add a salad to your pizza for half-price because, according to the menu, ""We want you to get some greens in your diet."" Now that's a blue-ribbon commitment to health. Another reason Uno's is at the top of our list: You know what you're eating. In the lobbies of most of the restaurant's locations, there are Nutrition Information Centers that detail ingredients, fat and sodium contents, and calories and fiber of every item, in addition to gluten-free options.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes a look at Health magazine's restaurant choices » . • Danger zone: Deep-dish pizzas can pile on the fat. • We love: The Penne Bolognese -- just 16 grams of fat (well within the daily recommended max of 65 grams of fat for a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet). Souplantation & Sweet Tomatoes . Can a buffet-style restaurant -- that symbol of American overindulgence --possibly be one of the healthiest restaurants in the country? It can in this case, because this salad-soup-and-bakery eatery (Southern California locations are named Souplantation, everywhere else they're called Sweet Tomatoes) uses produce so fresh that it's guaranteed to have been ""in the ground"" 24 hours before it's in a refrigerated truck on its way to the restaurant. At the salad bar you'll find seasonal vegetables like squash and bell peppers, freshly tossed and prepared salads, and a great range of nonfat dressings. San Marino Spinach With Pumpkin Seeds and Cranberries, anyone? This is paradise for vegetarians, vegans, and anyone who's looking for a low-sodium, low-fat, high-nutrient meal outside the home. • Danger zone: Plate overload -- after all, it's all-you-can-eat. • We love: The Tomato Spinach Whole Wheat pasta, a delicious combo of whole grains and veggies. Mimi's Cafe . This cozy café-style restaurant transforms normally less-than-healthy foods into better -- and still tasty -- options: a half-pound cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce (that's right, no bun); the cutely named Naked French Market Onion Soup, served without cheese. Another thing to love is the way that Mimi's clearly steers you toward its healthy options. Its ""Lifestyle Menu"" points you to low-carb picks like the fish of the day served with fresh steamed veggies. Also, Mimi's keeps portions small, so you can get away with occasionally having one of their more indulgent entrees like the Sweet & Sour Coconut Shrimp (608 calories). Health.com: Healthiest fast-food restaurants . • Danger zone: The ""Comfort Classics"" page of the menu, with throwbacks like rich (super-high-fat) Chicken Cordon Bleu. • We love: Chicken & Fruit -- grilled chicken and a garden salad, plus wedges of fresh orange, honeydew, watermelon, and cantaloupe. P.F. Chang's China Bistro . Take the best aspects of Asian cuisine -- a combination of fresh vegetables and protein -- surround them with healthy influences such as whole-grain brown rice, wild-caught, sustainable Alaskan salmon, and all-natural chicken, and you have a recipe for delicious, healthy dining. Wok-based cooking (which requires less oil) using soybean oil keeps fat contents low, and less sodium in the sauces rounds out  P.F. Chang's healthy take on Chinese food. Special credit goes to their nutritional information being based on the whole entrée, not a single serving like at most places. Health.com: Eat out, without gaining a pound . • Danger zone: Traditional, fat-dense items such as Lo Mein Beef. • We love: Carb-free vegetarian lettuce wraps -- wok-seared tofu, red onions, and water chestnuts with mint and lime, set in lettuce cups. Bob Evans Restaurants . You wouldn't think a restaurant that prides itself on sausage could muscle its way into the top five healthiest restaurants in the country. But Bob Evans scores high on its dinner menu, which has plenty of low-carb, low-fat entrees and alternatives for children and adults (chicken tenders that are grilled instead of fried, potato-crusted flounder, and salmon stir-fry). Look for sides like steamed broccoli florets and fresh fruit, and enjoy old-fashioned family meals in a modern, nutrition-forward way. • Danger zone: Breakfast, where bacon and sausage are kings. • We love: Healthy options on the kid's menu, like slow-roasted turkey with mashed potatoes and glazed baby carrots, and fruit and yogurt dippers for dessert. Ruby Tuesday . If we'd done this survey in 2004, Ruby Tuesday might have won the blue ribbon for printing all its nutritional content right on the menu. It was revolutionary, and, frankly, it didn't last. But the healthy ethos survived in the chain's ingredients: organic greens, hormone-free chicken, transfat-free frying oil, and better-for-you beverages including Jones organic teas and made-to-order drinks like all natural lemonades (think real fruit and juice). It's easy to find the good stuff -- it's highlighted -- and the offerings range from a chicken wrap in a whole-wheat tortilla to broiled tilapia. Health.com: The best independent restaurants . • Danger zone: Comfort-food entrees like Gourmet Chicken Potpie, which piles more than half your daily calories on the plate. • We love: That they've even healthied-up the burgers, offering veggie-and turkey-versions. Romano's Macaroni Grill . This Italian eatery puts its entire menu's nutritional content online, so you know before you go what to steer clear of -- mainly, the massive baked pastas. But what pushed Macaroni Grill onto our best list is its ""Sensible Fare"" menu, with entrees like Simple Salmon, a grilled fillet sided by grilled asparagus and broccoli. Grazie for whole-wheat penne available as a substitute in any dish. And bravo for including a grilled skinless chicken breast with steamed broccoli and pasta on the kid's menu. • Danger zone: Heavy entrees like spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce. • We love: The delicious Italian sorbetto and biscotti: just 330 calories and 4 grams of fat. Chevy's Fresh Mex . Chevy's makes a big deal out of the ""fresh"" in its name, and with good reason -- no cans in the restaurant, fresh salsa blended every hour, fresh avocados smashed every day for guacamole, and watch-them-made tortillas. All oils are trans fat-free, and the Mexican-style fare has lots of healthy options including Grilled Fish Tacos. Health.com: America's not-so-healthiest restaurants . • Danger zone: Sodium counts. To get below 1,000 milligrams, you'll need to get those Chicken Fajitas with no tortillas, tomalito, rice, sour cream, or guacamole. • We love: Fresh fish of the day, grilled and served on a skillet with homemade salsa. Olive Garden . Like Macaroni Grill, this Italian eatery has great-for-you options, as long as you keep your wits about you (again, avoid the baked pastas!). Use the olive-branch icon on the menu to find low-fat ""Garden Fare"" items such as Venetian Apricot Chicken. Even the fries aren't a disaster, because they're done in trans fat-free oil. You can grab some whole-grain goodness, too, by choosing the whole-wheat linguine at dinner as a substitute for any pasta. • Danger zone: The non-olive-branch entrees. Olive Garden provides no nutritional information on anything else on the menu. • We love: The low-fat Capellini Pomodoro (644 calories and 14 grams fat). Denny's . Yes, the home of the Lumberjack Slam and Moons Over My Hammy offers lots of skinny options to counter its fatty mainstays. ""Fit-Fare"" dishes such as the grilled-chicken-breast salad, and tilapia with rice and veggies, each have less than 15 grams of fat. Denny's also posts full nutritional information on its Web site. Its use of trans fats to cook its French fries kept it from landing higher on our list, but the rest of the fried food is trans fat-free. • Danger zone: Breakfast specials, especially the Meat Lover's Scramble, which is as bad for you as it sounds. • We love: The online nutritional chart has Weight Watchers Food Exchange Values.

30,"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says ordinary life stops when Muhammad Ali appears anywhere. (CNN) -- It was still early enough in the evening that the main dinner crowd had not yet started to show up; the restaurant, east of Michigan Avenue in Chicago, was less than half-filled. The party of 10 at the table by the front window had arrived promptly for their 6 p.m. reservation. Nine of the 10 studied their menus, but the 10th, the man at the head of the table, did not. Muhammad Ali, 67, stared down toward the white tablecloth and drew on a piece of paper. He sketched a picture of a mountain. There are a handful of men among us who, simply by appearing out of nowhere, make other men and women pause involuntarily to consider the long paths of their own lives. It is as if these men have always been with us, and if you should unexpectedly spot Bob Dylan in an airport, if you should see Paul McCartney walking through a hotel lobby, if you should encounter Sean Connery entering an office building, it will bring you up short. It's like opening a diary, even if you have never met them, even if you have never seen them except on a television set or a movie screen. Yet Ali is different even from them. Ali -- his story so complicated, his health failing, his imprint on the world so indelible -- makes people mist up the moment they lay eyes on him. It was happening tonight inside this restaurant called the Rosebud Steakhouse; diners at their own tables, not quite sure for a second that they were really seeing what they were seeing, let their gazes linger and could not look away. Ali drew. The other men and women at his table -- this was a gathering of family and friends to celebrate a birthday, and Ali had come into Chicago from his farm in Michigan -- talked animatedly and laughed. Ali did not speak. He wore a blue-and-white Hawaiian-style shirt; someone had tucked a white napkin into the space above the top button. Over the speaker system of the restaurant, a slowed-down acoustic knockoff of the old Tom Petty hit ""Free Fallin' "" was playing softly: . ""She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis ..."" A family, across the way, talked spiritedly among themselves. They were deciding something. The father and the children stood up. From the ceiling, the song: . ""... and I'm free, free fallin' ..."" They walked over to Ali's table. ""We apologize for the intrusion,"" the father said. Ali looked toward them, showing a gentle expression. The father had a camera. He said to his children: ""This is the most famous face in the world."" It is difficult to know what the children made of this. Youth and strength and beauty are so fleeting. The man in the Hawaiian shirt once embodied all of those things, before these children were born. Three times the world heavyweight boxing champion, the center of global fascination and frenzied controversy after winning his first title and then changing his name from Cassius Clay, endlessly mesmerizing with his float-like-a-butterfly, sting-like-a-bee ring style, called ""the greatest of all time"" so often that the words became almost an official designation, the sight of his flawless face and the sound of his confident-beyond-all-dispute voice a sustaining part of the very atmosphere. ... But his road has turned hard, and here were these children, who were not around for any of that, standing with their father next to the table. Ali's family members and friends said it would be all right for the father to take some photos, so he did. When he left, Ali went back to his drawing. More diners were beginning to arrive at the restaurant. Their evenings changed the moment they caught sight of him. Some pulled out cell phones to call people across the nation; others quietly debated whether to approach him. Many years ago, I traveled the country with him to prepare a magazine profile for a special issue on the 50 men and women judged to have had the greatest impact on society during their time on Earth. Everywhere Ali went, he was mobbed; people grabbed at him, people cried out, people attempted to touch his face. In the middle of all this one day, he said to me, almost in a whisper: . ""This is the whole world. This is what my whole life is like."" That hasn't changed, although his ability to speak aloud about it has. The food began to arrive at his table. The people to his right and to his left helped him with his. He demonstrated not the least sliver of self-consciousness; this is part of his life now, and he knows how much he is loved. He handed something to a man named Cleve Walker, who has been his friend for 50 years. It was a drawing that a young girl had brought over to him earlier. She had made a picture of a butterfly and had presented it to him. Now Ali gave it to Walker, who took it across the restaurant to where the child was sitting with her family. Ali had signed his name to it. Walker handed it to the little girl. Her face lit up. Outside the restaurant, on Walton Street, a group of young men walked by, wearing officially licensed jerseys bearing the names and uniform numbers of their favorite current-day sports stars. One of the young men glanced through the windowpane but did not register that the man at whom he was looking was Ali. Ali studied the tablecloth, and a birthday cake arrived, and the others at the table began to sing in the direction of one woman among them: . ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you ..."" Ali did not sing nor did he look up. But then the others reached the penultimate line of the song: . ""Happy birthday, dear Marilyn ..."" And with that Ali lifted his head and gazed directly at her, right into her eyes, and smiled the most luminous smile toward her. ""... happy birthday to you."" Soon they rose to depart. Some in the restaurant, now more crowded, applauded. Ali did not react. And then he was out on the street and in a moment out of sight. Around the next corner, although they did not yet know it, people would soon be stopping in their tracks. He may be the only one who remembers his life when it was any other way.

31,"IN THE FLORIDA KEYS (CNN) -- In the early morning darkness of the Florida Keys, the low hum of the Mystic I is hardly enough to disturb the slumber of the tourists in their hotel rooms. A lobster fisherman holds two spiny tail lobsters caught during the Mystic I's trip off the Florida Keys. From the wheelhouse, Captain Karl Lessard steers his boat into the darkness toward the fertile fishing grounds off the small Island of Marathon, Florida. This is a ritual that Lessard has done thousands of times. ""I've been fishing for 38 years, my family has been fishing since the 1820s, there are a lot of fourth-, fifth- and sixth-generation fishermen that are here in the Keys,"" Lessard says. At dawn he reaches a spot that holds a special meaning for him. ""I pass where my mother's and father's ashes are scattered. Just around sunrise, it's a very spiritual place for me."" In the light of a spectacular sunrise, Lessard plots his course on the open waters. ""I fish for the freedom,"" he explains. ""It's good for the soul. It's a fantastic way to make a living, coming out here in God's glory every day."" He adds with a laugh that fishing also ""gets me away from the house. I hate those 'honey-do's.' "" It's spiny tail lobster season in the Florida Keys, and that is what Captain Karl and his three-man crew are on a quest for today. ""I am hoping to catch between 300 and 400 pounds, with the new moon that slows fishing down,"" the skipper says. They travel 20 miles offshore to where they have put out their traps. They hope to find them filled with the clawless crustaceans that live in these shallow waters. ""In the Keys, people really started fishing for lobster in the 1930s,"" Lessard says. ""Before that there was very little market for them."" Lobster fishermen in years past worried more about the impact of things like hurricanes, but these days they have other concerns, namely the price they can get for their catch. ""This ... economy that we are in is not really promoting the sale of our product,"" Lessard says. ""Lobster is going from eight dollars a pound to three dollars a pound. We are basically in survival mode at the present time, but it is still a wonderful way to make a living."" As a mate hooks the buoys and throws the line in the winches, the traps break onto the surface. As they are hoisted on deck the captain smiles at what he is seeing. ""We got some nice lobsters today, some grandes,"" he says.  Watch the skipper at work on the water » . Lessard navigates his boat along his strings of traps as his crew pulls them, repeating the motion some 480 times. Two dolphins play off the bow. ""This is the most beautiful office that anyone could have in the world,"" the lobster fisherman says. ""If you feel the calling, there is no better way to make a living. It's something I've wanted to do since I was a child, and I'm blessed to have been able to do what I wanted to do in life, and have the freedom to do it. ""I hope my family can do it for another hundred years."" As the afternoon wears on, the traps rise out of the ocean and fall back to the seabed, and a constant flow of lobster fills up the boat's holding tanks. The catch seems to be better than expected. ""Sometimes if you are lucky, it's better than being good. And if you're good and lucky, that's even better,"" Lessard jokes. With the last trap dropped back into the water, Lessard and the crew of the Mystic I head back to the dock, where they will place the day's catch onto the scales to see how good the sea has been to them. ""Today we caught 476 pounds. I didn't expect to do this well with the phase of the moon,"" Lessard says. Tomorrow morning the captain will rise again in the darkness and answer the calling that he and his family have heeded for generations. ""My family is out here, and I plan on being out here and joining them someday,"" Lessard says, ""although I would like it to be a long time from now.""",0.5482471,7494
32,"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- What's in a name? Westerners are more accustomed to names that describe the ingredients and how they are cooked. Local dishes like ""Husband and wife's lung slice"" or ""Chicken without sexual life"" conjure lots of furrowed eyebrows on famished foreigners. So, with the Olympics a few short weeks away, China is giving its cuisine a linguistic makeover. It is proposing that restaurants change the names of exotic, but bizarrely named, delicacies to make them more delectable for the estimated 50,000 visitors arriving in August for the Summer Games. The appetizer ""Husband and wife's lung slice"" is taking on the more appetizing ""Beef and ox tripe in chili sauce."" ""Chicken without sexual life"" has been transformed into ""Steamed pullet."" The government has put down more than 2,000 proposed names in a 170-page book that it has offered to Beijing hotels, according to state media. ""Thanks to the pamphlet, we do not have to struggle to come up with the English translations of dishes any more, which is usually time consuming,"" a senior manager at the four-star Guangzhou Hotel in downtown Beijing told the Xinhua news agency. The Chinese say the names of their dishes focus more on appearance than taste or smell. But Westerners are more accustomed to names that describe the ingredients and how they are cooked -- such as pot roast. The government realizes local names are a matter of taste, but don't want them to get lost in translation. Hence, the spicy Sichuanese dish ""Bean curd made by a pock-marked woman"" has been bestowed the more palatable ""Mapo tofu."" Not everyone is pleased. ""The process of standardizing a menu translation is a double-edged sword,"" wrote columnist Raymond Zhou in the China Daily newspaper. It ""removes the ambiguity and unintended humor"" and ""takes away the fun and the rich connotation.

33,"(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix ""Mc"" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. ""We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,"" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. ""We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's."" The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. ""We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,"" Suppiah said. ""We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food."" The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix ""Mc"" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the ""Mc"" in McCurry stands for ""Malaysian Chicken Curry."" A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. ""We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,"" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: ""Tasty and so Gooood.""",0.53557146,6132
34,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Famed for keeping people slim, healthy and living longer, the Mediterranean diet has followers all over the world. Cultural treat? Moves are underway to get the Mediterranean diet on UNESCO's world heritage list. However, the diet is being increasingly shunned by people who live in the Med as the convenience of fast food gains popularity. The renowned low-fat, high-fiber diet has ""decayed into a moribund state"" in its traditional regions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). So sharp is the decline that governments from the region are scrambling to protect their traditional fare from becoming an ""endangered"" species. Populations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Spain and Italy, tend to eat these foods, and governments there have joined forces to apply for their diet to be placed on the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Heritage list. Those lobbying for UNESCO protection have argued that its inclusion would ''fend off the watered-down clones assailing its integrity worldwide in this age of killer fast food.'' The UNESCO list is famous for including historic and cultural sites but in recent years the UN body has opened its register to include ''intangible heritage,"" such as endangered languages or vanishing traditions. ""The Mediterranean diet is a heritage that should be protected and shared,"" Paolo de Castro, a former Italian Agriculture minister, said earlier this year. ""Science has long recognized the unusual health properties of the diet, which has strengthened and accompanied the common cultural identity of Mediterranean countries,"" he said, according to Italian news agency ANSA. ""The diet is an integral part of the historical and cultural identity of the Mediterranean, and an opportunity for growth for the countries in the area."" Originally considered the diet of the poor, who didn't have much money to buy meat, the ""Mediterranean diet"" is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, whole grains, fish and olive oil. Numerous studies have associated it with long life-spans and low rates of cancer, heart disease and other ailments.  See a comparison of the old and new diets in Mediterranean countries » . However, some fear that it has become supplanted by supermarket ready-made foods and fast food as people have become more cash-rich and time-poor. ""The European diet has become too fat, too salty and too sweet,"" senior FAO economist Josef Schmidhuber concluded in the group's report on the European Union diet. The FAO's 2008 report ranks Spain as the country with the biggest leap in fat consumption in Europe -- from 25 percent of the diet 40 years ago to 40 percent now. EU and Mediterranean countries with the worst dietary changes are Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Malta, where calorie intake has increased by 30 percent in the last few decades. Three-quarters of the population of Greece is overweight or obese, while in Spain and Italy the number is more than 50 percent. In the U.S., 66 percent of the population fits into this category. Alarmed by the growing health problems associated with obesity, Spain's Health Ministry has launched a series of initiatives to combat obesity. In 2007, it ordered fast-food chain Burger King to remove ads for its Big King XXL, which contains 1,000 calories, and which were aimed at teenagers and young people. A 2001 report by Foodservice Intelligence, a London-based market research firm, found that traditional-style restaurants in Italy and Spain were outnumbered two-to-one by their fast-food counterparts. UNESCO will decide whether to include the Mediterranean diet in its Heritage list late next year. Until then, Spain and other countries in the region undoubtedly will hope they can retain their reputation as a rewarding destination for the gourmet traveler.",0.52204597,6898
35,"London, England (CNN) -- Kraft's fresh bid for suffered a double blow Tuesday as the improved offer was dismissed by the British candy company and criticized by billionaire investor Warren Buffett who controls an influential stake in the U.S. food giant. Buffett said he had voted against Kraft's plan to issue new shares as part of a cash and stock offer worth approximately $16 billion, warning it would hurt shareholders, Fortune reported. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company owns 138 million Kraft shares, making it the largest shareholder in the foodmaker with a 9.4 percent stake. But in a statement, he warned Kraft's move for Cadbury risked undervaluing Kraft stock. ""Kraft stock, at its current price of $27, is a very expensive 'currency' to be used in an acquisition,"" Buffett said. ""In 2007, in fact, Kraft spent $3.6 billion to repurchase shares at about $33 per share, presumably because the directors and management thought the shares to be worth more."" Earlier, Illinois-based Kraft said it would use the proceeds from the sale of its U.S. pizza business to Nestle to increase the cash element of its Cadbury offer. Under Kraft's offer of a partial cash alternative, Cadbury shareholders could receive cash as well as Kraft shares if they accept Kraft's deal. ""Kraft Foods is doing this because of the desire expressed by some Cadbury security holders to have a greater proportion of the offer in cash,"" Kraft said in a statement. The maker of Jell-O, Cool Whip, Oreo cookies and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese also extended the Cadbury offer to February 2. The original bid had expired Tuesday. Cadbury, which rejected Kraft's previous two deals, rejected the new offer Tuesday. ""Kraft has once again missed the point,"" a Cadbury spokesman told CNN. ""Despite this tinkering, the Kraft offer remains unchanged and derisory, with less than half the consideration in cash."" There had been rumors that Swiss firm Nestle, which already has a chocolate and confectionery unit, would step in and make its own offer for Cadbury. But Nestle put an end to those rumors Tuesday by issuing a statement saying it had no intention to make an offer for the British company. Instead, Nestle said it had bought Kraft's frozen pizza business in the United States and Canada for $3.7 billion. The unit includes brands like DiGiorno, Tombstone, and California Pizza Kitchen. ""The acquisition brings leadership in the frozen pizza category, where Nestle only had a minor presence until now, and builds on Nestle's existing pizza know-how and operations in Europe,"" Nestle said in a statement Tuesday. ""It is a natural fit with Nestle's focus on delivering convenient, premium, wholesome and nutritious frozen food for consumers around the world."" Nestle already had a presence in American frozen food aisles with ready-meal brands like Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine, and Hot Pockets. The proceeds from the sale allow Kraft to offer more cash to Cadbury shareholders -- an additional 60 pence (96 cents) per share, Kraft said. Kraft originally offered Cadbury shareholders 300 pence ($4.81) and 0.26 Kraft shares for each share of Cadbury they own. Kraft said it will announce more detailed terms by January 19.",0.5213152,7985
36,"(CNN) -- Iceland is losing its only three McDonald's restaurants as a result of the poor economic situation in the country. Businessman Magnus Ogmundsson, who owns the only McDonald's franchise in Iceland, said it had become too expensive to operate the restaurants after Iceland's currency, the krona, plunged in value. ""The krona is quite weak and we are buying everything in euros, and we have very high tariffs on imported agricultural products,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. In January 2008, it cost more than 95 Icelandic krona to buy one euro, according to the Central Bank of Iceland. Tuesday, that price had shot up to more than 186 krona. That means the currency is worth half as much today as it was in January 2008 -- and things priced in euros now cost twice as much to buy. Ogmundsson said the McDonald's Corporation worked with him to find a solution, but in the end he had no choice but to close. There was ""good cooperation"" with McDonald's, Ogmundsson told CNN. ""No hard feelings."" McDonald's said it had become financially prohibitive to continue operating in Iceland because of ""the unique operational complexity of doing business in Iceland combined with the very challenging economic climate in the country."" It said there are no plans to seek a new franchise partner in that country. The three stores will close at midnight Saturday, but they will reopen as an independent chain called Metro, with more domestic ingredients and fewer imported products. ""We believe we can be more successful with our own brand,"" Ogmundsson said. A McDonald's Big Mac hamburger currently sells for the equivalent of $5.29, making Iceland one of the most expensive places in the world to buy the sandwich. Only Norway and Switzerland charge more, according to the countries listed on the Economist magazine's Big Mac Index, published in February. A Big Mac costs about $3.54 in the United States, $2.19 in Australia, $5.07 in Denmark, $1.66 in South Africa, and $1.52 in Malaysia.",0.50814617,8473
37,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British people love pubs -- so much, in fact, that a recent survey found that they cherish only fish and chips and the Queen more. A combination of factors including the smoking ban, higher taxes and cheap supermarket alochol are hurting pubs. Yet this enduring icon of British culture is under threat after having flourished for hundreds of years. Recent surveys found that more British pubs are closing than ever before -- victims of an indoor smoking ban, higher taxes and food prices, and changing times. Tuesday marks one year since England followed Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland to ban indoor smoking at pubs, restaurants and bars. Some feared that would mark the death of the traditional British pub in all its smoky glory -- and they were quick to blame the ban when surveys found the pub numbers in sharp decline. Those findings, released in March by the British Beer and Pub Association and CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale, showed that more than 1,400 pubs closed in 2007. That's a sharp increase from 2006, when 216 pubs closed; and 2005, when just more than 100 closed down. The advocacy groups, however, say the ban may be just one of many factors shutting pub doors.  Watch more on the decline of British pubs » . Pub owners -- landlords, as they're called in Britain -- are turning in their leases for a variety of reasons. Some say it's hard to compete with cheap alcohol sold at supermarkets, a trend increasing amid the credit crunch. Others feel they could make more money operating as a wine bar or cafe. Patrons say two things in particular have had an impact on the decline of pubs -- one being the smoking ban. Those who used to enjoy a smoke along with their pint now must smoke outside, and many pubs -- particularly in urban areas -- have little space or shelter on the sidewalk. CAMRA says, however, that the effects of the smoking ban, introduced just halfway into 2007, are ""not yet fully evident."" Pubgoers were also turned off by a boost to alcohol taxes. ""Rents and rates are shooting up,"" said Ian Lowe, a spokesman for CAMRA. ""There's also things like excise duty. The chancellor kindly put another 4 pence [8 cents] on the price of a pint, and while supermarkets can probably absorb that, the pubs have to pass it on [to the customer]."" Pubs are also passing higher food prices on to the customer, denting a plan by many proprietors to fall back on the menus to boost business. About 57,000 pubs remain in Britain, and while they may be under threat, they're not going away any time soon. A drink at ""the local"" -- where social and financial status cease to matter -- remains one of the average Briton's favorite pastimes. ""If you took a guy from the 10th Century and brought him forward in time, the only things he would recognize in the world today are churches and pubs,"" said Peter Brown, the author of ""Man Walks Into a Pub,"" a history of pubs and beer. The smoking ban may also be attracting a new kind of customer, Brown said. ""[Smokers] stopped going to the pub immediately as soon as the ban came in, whereas a lot of other people who didn't used to go to pubs have now started to come back to the pub because they now prefer a smoke-free environment,"" he said. Advocates say pubs provide a safe place to drink and are a valuable part of British culture. They are lobbying the British government to help stop their rapid decline by cutting beer taxes and changing planning laws to prevent pub demolitions.

38,"(CNN)  -- Not content to sit quietly at home eating their tofu cutlets, more and more vegetarians, it seems, are taking action, trying to get the carnivorous masses to change their ways. Of course, the meat-free have been trying to win people over to their cause since the time of Pythagoras. But lately, activists are trying more in-your-face tactics. For Lierre Keith, author of ""The Vegetarian Myth,"" the ""in-your-face"" part is quite literal. A former vegetarian who has publicly recanted, she was lecturing in San Francisco, California, last week, when three masked assailants shouted ""Go vegan!"" and lobbed chili pepper-laced pies at her. Even in hard-core vegan circles -- which exclude using animal-based products for food, clothing, medicine or any other purpose -- such borderline-violent exploits are controversial. More common is the approach of folks like newly converted talk show host Ellen Degeneres, who has been sharing recipes for vegan nachos along with her philosophy. Still, recipes only go so far. And, more to the point, they don't get as much media attention. For many vegan and vegetarian activists, getting coverage is an art. PETA . If you've ever read about a particularly outrageous pro-vegetarian campaign, there's a good chance that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals was behind it. The folks at PETA seem to be firm believers in the idea that ""all media attention is good media attention,"" and the more shocking or ridiculous the stunt, the more media outlets will pick up the story. PETA was laughed at when it tried to rebrand fish as ""sea kittens,"" in hopes that the more cuddly name would make seafood a less appealing mealtime choice. It was criticized for the suggestion that recently deceased Oscar G. Mayer should be buried with his company's hot dog-shaped Wienermobile. After British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay cooked up horse meat on his show, PETA UK dumped a ton of manure outside his London restaurant. Plenty of ecological activists cringe at these kinds of prankish maneuvers, but they do get noticed. And that, apparently, is the point. Why else would PETA organize an army of zombies to protest outside of KFC restaurants? Not content to oppose meat-eating in the real world, PETA also took a swipe at virtual carnivorousness: In response to the Nintendo DS game ""Cooking Mama,"" the group released its own bloody version. And, as anyone who's seen its anti-fur posters knows, PETA is well aware that sex sells. The group got the granddaughter of Argentinean revolutionary Che Guevara to pose wearing nothing but a bandolier filled with carrots. Last, year PETA proposed a too-racy-for-TV ""vegetarians have better sex"" Super Bowl commercial, guaranteeing plenty of coverage when -- surprise! -- NBC rejected the ad. PETA also brings its soft-core approach to the streets with its ""Lettuce Ladies"" campaign: young models, clad in a few strategically placed leaves, handing out veggie hot dogs. The group has enlisted Pamela Anderson and Elizabeth Berkley to pose for the Lettuce Ladies Web site (find it yourself) -- probably the best thing that's happened to their careers in years. Is there tofu wresting? Yes, there is tofu wrestling. Casa Diablo . PETA is not alone in combining feminine pulchritude and an anti-meat agenda. A couple of years back, Portland, Oregon, resident Johnny Diablo got a bunch of media attention when he opened Casa Diablo, the world's first vegan strip club. Serving veggie burgers with a side of nudity (or maybe the other way around) might seem to be just a publicity stunt. (The fact that Diablo tried to put the club up for sale shortly after opening would seem to suggest that.) But Mr. Diablo is an earnest vegan himself, and he's apparently retained ownership of Casa Diablo, though reviews -- of both the cuisine and the more fleshy attractions -- are decidedly mixed. McVegan . As the most public face of our carnivorous culture, McDonald's is a popular target of vegetarian activism. Back in 1985, the London branch of Greenpeace declared October 16 World Anti-McDonald's Day, and every year since, there have been protests and rallies all over the globe. The group Vegan Action, founded by Berkeley students in 1993, has come up with a gentler -- and tastier -- way to combat the ubiquity of the golden arches. With its help, you can host your own ""McVegan"" event. There will be veggie burgers, there will be uniformed servers, and there will even be a costumed clown mascot -- Reggie McVeggie, ""Ronald's kinder brother."" The slogan: ""Billions and billions saved."" Vegan Avengers . Even a green group like Friends of the Earth isn't safe from vegan wrath. Last year, the group hosted a comedy night at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, only to have the event crashed by masked activists wearing enormous artificial testicles. They called themselves the ""Vegan Avengers,"" and their crude slogan suggested that the middle-of-the-road members of FoE should grow a similar pair by supporting veganism. The Avengers have not been heard from since their single appearance.",0.48608732,9062
39,"(CNN) -- Sin Hwa Dee began operations in the 1970s as a cottage industry in the former soya sauce-producing enclave of Kim Chuan Road, in the Paya Lebar area of Singapore. Mr. and Mrs. Chng Kee started out producing soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in the 1970s. It was founded by the late Mr. Chng Kee, a former soya salesman, who ran the business with his wife, a soya production operator. Together they sold mainly soya and oyster sauces, bean paste and plum paste in bulk under the Sin Hwa Dee label to the restaurant, hotel and catering industries. In 1990, the company began producing the preserved fruits and vegetables used to make the traditional Lunar New Year dish of Yu Sheng. One of Sin Hwa Dee's factories is dedicated exclusively to the production of Yu Sheng products, while another factory produces noodles for the restaurant and catering industries. Mr. Chng's daughter Jocelyn first decided to introduce the company's products to the foreign market when she attended the SIAL exhibition in Paris in 1992, noting that there was a clear interest in Asian food. Sin Hwa Dee's first premix, the Laksa Paste, was launched into the food services market under the CHNG Kee's label in 1994, followed by the Kung Bo Sauce, the Black Pepper Sauce and their famous chicken rice mix. In 1996, the company invested heavily in equipment and technology to produce sauces and premixes in bottles for the retail market under the CHNG Kee's label. In 2005, Sin Hwa Dee moved into their own building, CHNG Kee's Foodlink, located in Senoko South Road, north of Singapore, with a production team of over 75 employees producing more than 20 tons of sauces per day. Today, their clientele includes Singapore Airlines, Pizza Hut, KFC, Burger King, hotels such as the Ritz Carlton, Conrad International Centenniel, Raffles Hotel, Hilton Hotel, Marriott Hotel, and restaurants such as Lei Garden and Crystal Jade.",0.482214,526

41,"(Mental Floss) -- Even in the midst of the Civil War, there was still one thing the North and South shared -- a serious addiction to caffeine. Confederate troops were less likely to get a cup of coffee. In that respect, the Union clearly had an advantage. Not only did the North have more than two-thirds of the population and control most of the heavy industry, railroads, and financial reserves in the country, it hoarded supplies of the highly addictive little bean, leaving the Confederacy to wage its own war against java deprivation. Coffee: It's what's for breakfast, lunch and dinner . Throughout the Civil War, coffee was as prevalent on the battlefields as it is in offices today. In fact, the Union army was fueled by the stuff to the point that, if there was no time to boil water, the Boys in Blue would chew on whole beans as they marched. And at night, Union campsites were dotted with tiny fires, each boiling a pot of coffee like a million miniature Starbucks. Beyond caffeine cravings, Union troops loved their coffee because it was, literally, the best thing on the menu. Before the advent of helpful (and tasty!) artificial preservatives, a marching soldier's rations were neither varied nor particularly appetizing. Typically, they consisted of salted meat, unleavened bread (accurately christened ""hardtack""), and a little sugar and salt. It didn't help that Union supply chains were riddled with corrupt food contractors who charged the government top dollar for rotten, stale, and insect-ridden foodstuffs. Coffee, however, was almost always fresh because it was delivered in whole-bean form -- making it difficult for even the most dishonest supplier to skimp on quality. Not that they didn't try, of course. In fact, officials began requesting coffee as whole beans after some crooked contractors tried to up their per-pound profits by slipping sand and dirt into packages of ground coffee. In 1861, hoping to cut down on the time soldiers spent roasting and grinding beans, the army switched to a concentrated proto-instant coffee. The new concoction, called ""essence of coffee,"" was made by boiling prepared coffee, milk, and sugar into a thick gloop, which soldiers then reconstituted by mixing it with water. The product reportedly tasted every bit as bad as you'd imagine, and thanks to the corrupt dairymen who sold the army spoiled milk, it also tended to cause diarrhea. Needless to say, the Union army was soon back on the bean. Southern discomfort . Noxious as essence of coffee was, Confederate soldiers would have gladly downed a cup or two. But, because of a Union naval blockade, coffee (along with weapons, machinery, medicine, and other vital materials) was in short supply in the South. Before the war, a pound of beans would have set you back around 20 cents in Yankee dough. Once pre-war stockpiles ran out, however, the same amount was running as high as $60 in Confederate money. (Despite the undervalued currency, that was still a lot.) There was some coffee that made it into the Confederacy -- usually carried by steam-powered blockade-runner ships. But, for the most part, Southerners had to rely on coffee substitutes, including various forms of roasted corn, rye, okra seeds, sweet potatoes, acorns, and peanuts. Unfortunately, all these imitations lacked potency, tasted awful, and upset the bowels. The only slightly better alternative was tea made from the leaves of the native yaupon shrub. The good news was that it contained caffeine; the bad news was that it was incredibly difficult to digest. Luckily, there was one surefire way for Southern folk to get their coffee -- by making peace with the Union. Soldiers on the front lines often called informal truces so Rebels could swap tobacco for Yankee coffee and then dash back to their camps before they were reported missing. E-mail to a friend .

42,"CAMEMBERT, France (CNN) -- We're up in the north central part of France -- Normandy -- to see what's happening with French cheese. Cheese lovers will be happy to know, just about nothing, at least as far as the traditional cheeses are concerned. Cheese from the Camembert region now carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine. But for the milk industry in general, it's another story. It has now a larger annual turnover than the steel industry in France (which admittedly is in decline.) Somehow the French have figured a way to export dairy products to people who already have cows and their own dairy industries-- to the tune of nearly €4 billion ($6 billion) per year. CNN spoke to a few of the people who do just that everyday and who are part of the changing face of France. Philippe Meslon, the mayor of Saint-Loup de Fribois and the administrator of the Saint-Loup cheese works says: ""A camembert not made out of raw milk is like making love without sex. ""A Frenchman is someone who cultivates with modern evolution his past. It's someone who protects moral values, cultural values and artistic values, and when I say cultural values I would include camembert."" Meslon and small cheese makers like Francois Durand, who has 40 cows, have struggled and won the right to an Appelation d'Origine Controllee -- the mark AOC for their ""Camembert de Normandie"" which carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine. For Durand making cheese is about not cutting corners. ""You have to have the passion,"" he says.  ""Yes it's difficult because it means a lot of work. We make it all by hand. I do believe it is important because the cheese is an emblem of France. It is a gastronomic emblem."" Still some small cheesemakers have been driven out of business and the taste and smell of their particular cheeses are lost to the world forever. For Michel Delorme it was a combination of new, more stringent rules and his age that led him to quit producing his handmade Camemberts. Michel Delorme: ""It's more and more complicated for those who stay in the business. They must hold out! Yes I miss the cheese a little. That's true. But I've kept my souvenirs, you see I've kept my old milk cans so I can stay in the spirit of Camembert!"" Despite those who've quit, the actual number of the variety of cheeses in France is growing. At the last cheese census more than 1,000 different kinds of cheeses were made here. The milk industry is no small cheese in France, thanks to the efforts of people like Philippe Jachnik who travels the world endlessly promoting milk products, which these days include protein supplements and milk derivatives that can go into all sorts of processed food. Jachnik, who works for the milk marketing consortium, says: ""I really would say I am selling the French approach to milk. We EAT a lot of milk. We DRINK a lot of water, wine, beer and coffee. But drinking milk is not a big business here. ""France has developed technological and marketing knowledge about adding value to a raw material-- milk. I have been traveling for 40 years all around the world and I feel so welcome. When you are French and you demonstrate that being French you can listen to others, people are interested in knowing about this country, about its people, about the way of life here."" Jachnik must be doing a good job as it's not just abroad that the French are selling more milk products-- cheese consumption in France has doubled from 12 to 24 kilos per person per year. It seems there's no curding their enthusiasm ...  E-mail to a friend .",0.4753701,4564

Soon you can do the same, knowing which cuts to choose for maximum flavor and nutrition. A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein and is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus. Beef Background . Humans began domesticating cattle, Bos taurus, about 8,500 years ago. Columbus first brought cattle to the New World, and by 1690, descendants of Columbus' cattle ranging in Mexico were driven north and became known as Texas Longhorns. Others arrived later with the colonists. America's top five cattle breeds are Angus from Scotland, Hereford from England, Limousin from France, Simmenthal from Switzerland, and Charolais from France. More than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in America, while most of the rest is Canadian bred. The beef we eat comes mostly from 18- to 24-month-old steers, averaging about 1,000 pounds, and yielding about 450 pounds of meat. Each is divided for wholesale into eight primals (major portions): the chuck (shoulder and upper ribs), the rib, the loin, the sirloin (hip), the round (upper leg), the brisket (breast), the plate (belly), and the small flank. Organs like liver and kidneys are called variety meats. When evaluating your choices at the grocery store, here are a few key terms and facts to know: . • Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots. Since corn is not a natural part of a cow's diet, cattle fed on it may experience stress and other ailments, so they are routinely treated with antibiotics. They also receive growth hormones to increase their size (and value, as beef is sold by weight). Until recently, inexpensive corn has helped keep down the price of beef. • Grass-finished: Grass- or pasture-finished beef comes from cattle that forage on grasses and legumes. Their meat is lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and calories than grain-finished. (Because it is quite lean, cook rare to medium-rare for juiciness.) Grass-fed beef has a distinct flavor, often described as bold, complex, and gamy. Many people believe that grass-fed cattle are a more sustainable choice. However, raising grass-fed cattle is time-consuming and requires large open spaces, variables that raise its price. Most is imported from Canada, followed by Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Brazil. • Aging: Dry-aging is the traditional process preferred by many steak lovers. The concentrated, intense flavor of dry-aged beef develops as it hangs in special temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms from 10 days to six weeks. The longer the aging, the better the flavor and tenderness, but also the more the shrinkage as water evaporates and a dark crust develops, which must be cut away. About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts. During the average seven-day period the beef spends ""in the bag,"" it ages in a process called ""wet-aging."" • Processing and packaging: Until the 1960s butcher shops bought beef as half- or quarter-carcasses. Packers then began selling vacuum-packed beef, the same large cuts sold at warehouse club stores. Retailers refrigerated the boxes until needed, then opened the package and cut the meat into portions for sale. Next came case-ready meat, which precluded the need for skilled butchers on-site in markets. Leak-proof and easily stackable, case-ready packages are produced in USDA-inspected plants and have a longer shelf life. Packages covered with a sealed layer of clear plastic are modified-atmosphere packages, which have a gas-filled space inside to help preserve freshness and color. Nutrition . • Fat content: The USDA defines ""lean beef"" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef. Half of the fat is saturated and half is heart-healthy monounsaturated. There are 29 naturally lean cuts of beef, including many familiar to Cooking Light readers, such as tenderloin, flank steak, and sirloin, as well as five lesser-known cuts. Others, such as ribeye or chuck roast, naturally contain more fat, although it is similarly divided between saturated and monounsaturated. Because lean beef contains less fat, it's best cooked to medium-rare (145°F) or medium (160°F) to optimize tenderness. If using fattier cuts, slice away the outer rim of fat and cut or pull out any pockets of fat before cooking. For larger cuts, allow the fat to baste the meat while cooking, then trim away before eating, or skim it from the surface of braised dishes or stews. • Other nutrients: A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein -- more than half of the 50g recommended daily in a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. All beef is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus. In general, the redder the meat, the more iron it contains (beef liver has the most). Beef also contains thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin and is a rich source of B12, found naturally only in animal foods. CookingLight.com: Fat and Ground Beef . At the Market . • Inspection and grading: USDA inspectors examine all live animals and beef shipped out of state, which encompasses most of today's supermarket beef. Grading is voluntary and done by the same inspectors. The more marbling -- the small white flecks of fat within the muscles -- the higher the grade. Three grades of beef are sold to consumers. Only three percent is highly marbled Prime, sought after by top steak houses and butcher shops. About 57 percent is moderately marbled Choice, the most common supermarket grade. The remaining 40 percent is lean Select. • Private labels: Supermarket chains and large food distributors also have developed private brands with their own specifications. The first such program began in 1978 with Certified Angus Beef, which must come from Angus cattle. Niman Ranch Natural Beef and Certified Hereford Beef are two others. • Natural and Organic: Beef labeled ""natural"" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef. ""Organic"" beef must come from cattle raised and certified according to the USDA's National Organic Program. Organic cattle must be fed 100-percent organically and without antibiotics or hormones. Both natural and organic beef can be either grass- or grain-finished. Ways to Save . • Buy lean cuts. Often, leaner cuts are cheaper than fatty ones. And when the fat cooks away, lean cuts provide more meat for your dollar. • Buy in bulk. Large or family-sized packages cost less per pound than smaller packages. Divide into portions, and freeze the surplus. • Be your own butcher. Beef that has been presliced into steaks or made into patties costs more than less processed meat. Buy bigger cuts, and do some of the preparation work yourself. CookingLight.com: Beef on a Budget . • But don't go overboard. Advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible, but you'll likely have more meat than you can store. Such a purchase may yield what one buyer describes as ""cheap steak and expensive hamburger."" For more tips on making healthy taste great, try Cooking Light - CLICK HERE .

44,"(CNN) -- Starbucks is closing more than two-thirds of its stores in Australia, days after announcing that hundreds of its American coffee outlets are also being shuttered. Starbucks announced plans to close 600 stores in the U.S. last week. The Seattle-based global coffee franchise said Tuesday that it will close 61 of its 84 locations in Australia by the weekend. The closures will mean that only 23 cafes will remain open in and around three major cities: Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Earlier this month, the company announced it would close 600 company-owned stores in the United States. Starbucks, named after the first mate in Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick,' was founded in 1971. It has more than 8,000 company-operated stores and another 6,800 licensed cafes in 44 countries. Starbucks has seen rising competition from privately-held Dunkin' Donuts and McDonalds recently, and welcomed founder Schultz back as CEO in January after a lackluster performance by the company in the latter half of 2007.",0.45990404,824
45,"LONDON, England -- Painfully hot, they make your eyes water, your heart race and can turn your face embarrassingly red. Chilies have been used for many millenia both for their medicinal benefits and exciting falvor. Once only a staple of cuisine from far flung regions of the world, chilies can now be found in almost any dish around the globe. Last week an Indian woman wolfed down 51 ""ghost chilies,"" -- the world's spiciest -- in two minutes and smeared the seeds on her eyes for an entry into the Guinness World Records. Anandita Dutta Tamuly, 28, achieved the bizarre and fiery undertaking in the Indian north-eastern state of Assam. She was cheered on by British chef Gordon Ramsay, who also attempted a bite of the hot stuff before begging for water. A single seed can cause watering eyes, as well as a burning sensation in the mouth that can last up to five hours. A chili's spiciness is measured in Scoville units; the number of times a chili extract must be diluted in water in order for it to lose its heat. The ""ghost chili"", also known as bhut jolokia, has more than 1 million Scoville units, while Tabasco sauce ranges from 2,500 to 5,000 Scoville units and jalapeno peppers from 2,500 to 8,000 units. Chilies have formed part of the diet in the Americas since approximately 7,500 BC and owe most of their fame to their sometimes unbearably spicy flavor. But they have also long been recognized for their health benefits. Scientific research --and legend--  have attributed health wonders to chilies over the years. Diego Alvarez Chanca, a physician on explorer Christopher Columbus' second voyage to the West Indies in 1493, first wrote about the pepper's medicinal effects back in 1494. Below we look at effects eating chilies has on the body. Skin . Other than for its flavor-enhancing qualities, chili is, oddly enough, used to fight the summer heat. As the chili causes extreme sweating and blood rushing to the face, it cools the body down when the sweat evaporates, making it useful for combating heat. These same heat inducing properties are said to have a cumulative effect and over time are believed to alleviate pain when used in treatments for anything from arthritis and psoriasis to shingles and severe burns. Brain . The substances that give chili peppers their intensity when eaten or applied on the skin are called capsaicinoids. When consumed, capsaicinoids connect with pain receptors in the mouth and throat that are normally responsible for sensing heat. Once activated by the capsaicinoids, these receptors send a message to the brain that the person has consumed something hot. The brain responds to the burning sensation by raising the heart rate, increasing perspiration and releasing endorphins, called the body's ""natural painkillers"" and ""happy hormones."" Stomach . Chilies have long been associated with soothing the digestive system, by acting as stomach cleansers. According to the UK Food Guide, chili helps to settle stomach upset and encourages the production of good digestive acid. Chili aficionados believe the fruits can also induce weight loss because the substance that makes them ""hot"" speed up the body's metabolism. However, one study by the American Institute of Cancer Research performed in Mexico showed in 2003 that a high consumption of chilies (approximately nine to 25 jalapeno peppers per day) is in fact associated with stomach cancer. Immune system . Red chilies contain high amounts of carotene and vitamin C. It is said that chilies contain more vitamin C than citrus fruits. Chili peppers are also a good source of vitamin B6 and are very high in potassium, magnesium and iron, giving them a reputation for naturally boosting the body's immune system. Heart and other cardiovascular effects . A 2006 study published in the British Journal of Nutrition showed that after adding chili to the diet, bad cholesterol, that can often lead to heart problems, took a longer time to develop into heart diseases.",0.447946,2766
46,"(CNN) -- Coca Cola was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local pharmacist, produced the syrup for Coca-Cola. It was put on sale at the nearby Jacobs' Pharmacy for five cents a glass as a soda fountain drink. An international organization, The Coca-Cola Company's first soda fountain sales to Canada and Mexico were recorded in 1897. Its first international bottler -- in Panama -- was established in 1906. The company entered China in 1927 and its 100th country -- Sierra Leone -- in 1957. Today, The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company with the most extensive distribution system in the world, operating in more than 200 countries across the world. The company currently has over 400 different brands under its control, and is one of the most recognizable names in the commercial world. The Coca-Cola Company, including the bottling entities it owns, employs approximately 71,000 people. More than 58,000 of those employees work for the company outside of the U.S. They are the largest private-sector employer across all of Africa. And in South Africa, for every one job created by the Coca-Cola system, 16 jobs are created in the informal retail sector. The company was placed in the top 25 places to work by Essence magazine and was named Wal-Mart's International Supplier of the Year in 2006. E-mail to a friend .",0.42868763,416
