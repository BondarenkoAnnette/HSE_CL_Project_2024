0,"LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years. A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England's Bristol museum. This time, however, the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK. CNN's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date. The artist's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The exhibition's range, while very varied, remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art.  See pictures from Banksy's exhibition » . ""I think we might have dragged them down to our level rather than being elevated to theirs"" Banksy, who is thought to be from Bristol, said about the museum. He filled three stories of the building with his art in 36 hours under tight security, as only a few museum staff were aware of the shows' imminent arrival. His work is hidden among the museum's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms, including installations, paintings and sculptures. In one of the paintings, a character has been cut out and is instead sitting on the painting's frame, perhaps taking a break from posing? Another piece, which at first glance, looks like a copy of an ancient classical statue, is in fact a woman over-loaded with countless shopping bags as she browses for yet another item. Perhaps the most controversial, yet equally light-hearted piece, is a painting of the British Parliamentary House of Commons, filled with chimpanzees who are looking surprisingly ""ministerial."" ""You paint a hundred chimpanzees and they call you a guerilla artist,"" Banksy said. While one of the more poignant installations is that of Tweety, the Warner Bros. animated character famous for his upbeat personality and energy, looking old and life-less. ""This show is my vision of the future,"" the artist said . Banksy is unlikely to show up at the exhibition as he attempts to retain his anonymity. But while we may never know his identity, with this latest show, Banksy has definitely shown yet another facet of his personality. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report .",0.7977188,7484
1,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it. In a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery."" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January  2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Denver? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners.  See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art » . Another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing ""Inspiring Impressionism"" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off. Do all the boats in Monet's ""Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil"" float? Smart museum-goers will see it all. ""The Louvre and the Ancient World"" and the companion show ""The Eye of Josephine,"" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings.   See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows » . The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne. One very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's ""The Beggar Boy"" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. From the outset, visitors to ""Inspiring Impressionism"" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre"" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's ""The Tiber"" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere. High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities ""visual evidence of connections."" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the ""moderns"" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly: ""No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters."" Joining Northern trust Corporation in funding the exhibition are the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support is also provided by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.

3,"(CNN) -- Police have recovered two of the four Impressionist paintings stolen earlier this month in a daring museum heist, police in Zurich, Switzerland said Tuesday. Claude Monet's ""Poppies near Vetheuil"" has been recovered by Swiss police. The Monet and van Gogh oil paintings were in good condition, police said, and the search continued for the other two -- a Cezanne and a Degas. A parking lot attendant at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich found the paintings Monday afternoon in the back of an unlocked white car, police said.

4,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Banksy is Britain's most wanted artist -- his art sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas, while all the time keeping his identity a secret. Banksy's latest piece in East London where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist. The guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around Britain and further afield for over ten years. Last week ten of his original pieces were sold at Bonham's auction house in London for over $1 million, while on the other side of the city Tower Hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets. From his beginnings as a graffiti artist in Bristol, England, Banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art. Depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats, his work is now sold now by major art galleries. Lazarides Gallery in London is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as ""a media star...but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff."" While he set out to lampoon the establishment, he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it. Fans include Hollywood A-listers, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006, including one of Queen Victoria sitting on a woman's face. The recent sales of his work put him on a par with Jean-Michel Basquiat as the best-selling street artist. He is feted by art dealers and artists, including Damien Hirst, but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the Tate gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It took the British Museum eight days to discover the ""prehistoric"" rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the British Museum Banksy has hung on a wall. There is often a political message with this work, too. He left an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo prisoner in Disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the Palestinian side of the West Bank wall. Despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work, Banksy's identity remains a mystery. As he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense, but also adds to his mystique. Some things are know: he's originally from Bristol, is around 30 years old and called Robert or Robin Banks, but it's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator. He continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art. Veteran British art critic Brian Sewell called Banksy, ""a complete clown, and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art."" Bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city. Other local authorities don't feel the same way. Tower Hamlets and Hackney councils in London have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets. His latest work painted on a wall in East London -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist's response. But this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like. A passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work. A spokesperson for Banksy refused to confirm it was him, but did say it was definitely his work.  E-mail to a friend .",0.75394535,156
5,"(CNN) -- Steven Spielberg led the FBI straight to a stolen $700,000 Norman Rockwell painting someone snatched from a Missouri gallery. It was in his collection in California. The original of this Norman Rockwell reproduction was found in the collection of Steven Spielberg last year. Spielberg wasn't the thief, and he doesn't know who took Rockwell's ""Russian Schoolroom"" -- an oil of 16 pupils looking at a bust of Lenin. All the A-list director knows is he paid about $200,000 for the 16 x 37 canvas in a legitimate purchase. The FBI says its just one example of how pilfered art lands in  respectable places. And it was an uncommon ending for stolen art -- someone found it. Recovering masterpieces happens in less than 5 percent of cases, said Bonnie Magness-Gardiner, the FBI's Art Theft Program manager. Usually, expensive pieces go missing. No one knows who took them. No one gets prosecuted, and everyone wonders, ""Why steal something you can't turn to cash quickly?"" Art thieves do a simple risk versus reward evaluation, said Corine Wegener, associate curator of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Thieves know that ""even if they receive only a fraction of the work's market value, the cash gained was at low risk of death or injury -- museums can be a relatively soft target,"" said Wegener, who's teaching a University of Minnesota class this month on art theft. But it could be years -- or never -- before the thief sees even a small payoff. In 1990, robbers took $300 million worth of certified masterpieces -- among them Rembrandt's ""Storm on the Sea of Galilee"" and Vermeer's ""The Concert"" -- from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. No one's seen them since. On Sunday, robbers made off with one of the biggest art hauls in European history, grabbing four paintings worth an estimated $163 million from the E.G. Buehrle Collection in Zurich, Switzerland. They took works by Paul Cezanne, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh.  See what robbers grabbed in Switzerland » . ""These paintings are extremely valuable on the open market, but they'll never go onto the open market. So at the same time they're both priceless and worthless,"" said Charles Hill, the former chief of Scotland Yard's art and antiques unit. ""Some thieves may buy into the myth that a wealthy but unscrupulous collector will contact them and offer to take the art off their hands,"" Wegener said. ""When this doesn't happen, the thieves often try to ransom the art back to the museum or the insurance company."" One London art dealer, who said he has handled stolen works, told CNN on condition of anonymity that an insurance company would rather get art back at a fraction of its original price than pay the owner its insured value.  Watch how art thieves operate » . Ransoming art to an insurance company through an intermediary adds ""up to 10 percent of the market value, which ... given the art market, is quite a lot of money,"" the dealer said. David Vuillaume, secretary general of the Swiss Museums Association, told Time magazine that ransom may be what the thieves behind the Swiss heist want. ""We are thinking that maybe in a week or two there will be a ransom demand. But we just have to wait and see,"" Time quoted him as saying. The museum has offered $90,000 reward for information leading to their recovery, Time reported. Options for art thieves . Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register, which operates a database to help recover lost and stolen art, said ransom or reward are unlikely to bring results. ""It is very seldom that people have been able to undertake a ransom,"" he said. ""This gang might think that a reward has been offered, and that they'll get the reward."" But in fact, ""the reward won't be paid unless someone is arrested, or there is proper criminal intelligence,"" and that's unlikely to happen, Radcliffe said. He said the thieves may just be patient, willing to get their payoff decades later. Or the art may move through an underground network, gradually increasing in value, before being slipped back onto the legitimate market. Take Spielberg. He bought ""Schoolroom"" in an above-the-board transaction. ""Usually, these pictures will change hands in the criminal underworld at a fraction -- 1 percent or less -- of their true market value,"" Radcliffe said, before someone tries to get them back into the international market. In such an effort, the seller may hope the work has been forgotten over time or they may disguise it as a copy or student re-creation. ""They may try and sell them not as being by Degas, but as being a copy, or school, or by a follower of one of the great artists. And that is the ways in which they try and get them on the market,"" Radcliffe said. The original thieves rarely face justice, the FBI's Magness-Gardiner said. ""The stolen items turn up years, sometimes decades, after the theft,"" she said. ""Because a work of art does not require a title document in order to be transferred from one owner to another, a stolen object easily enters the legitimate stream of commerce. ""It is impossible to trace them back to the original thief in most cases. Even if the original thief can be identified, there is also a statute of limitations on prosecution for theft,"" Magness-Gardiner said. What happens to stolen art? Even if the art is recovered, original owners may not get it back. While museum pieces are likely to go back to their collections, private owners may not be so lucky. ""Russian Schoolroom"" remains in Spielberg's possession while courts determine the rightful owner, a spokesman for the director said. But art stolen from a Los Angeles mansion and sold in Sweden remains with its Swedish purchasers, according to a case file posted on the Web site of the Los Angeles Police Department's Art Theft Detail. Even though the thief was caught, ""the Swedish government refused to return the paintings, claiming that according to Swedish law, the auction buyers had purchased the paintings in good faith,"" according to the Web site. In the case of Rockwell's ""Russian Schoolroom,"" someone took it from a gallery in Clayton, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, in 1973, according to an FBI synopsis of the case. In 2004, The FBI's Art Crime Team found out that the piece had been for sale at a New York Rockwell exhibition 15 years earlier and posted a picture and description of the painting on its art recovery Web site. Spielberg's staff learned of the search and told the FBI that Spielberg had it in his collection in Los Angeles. He had purchased it from a legitimate dealer in 1989, an FBI press release said. The agency also determined the painting was auctioned in New Orleans in 1988, but it has yet to determine who took the painting or its whereabouts from 1973 to 1988. Whoever took ""Russian Schoolroom"" from the suburban St. Louis gallery in 1973, or the masterpieces from the Boston museum 1980, or the works lifted in Zurich this week, shouldn't be mistaken for a high-society, tuxedo-wearing, ""Thomas Crown Affair"" kind of thief, Radcliffe said. ""These people are the worst sort of criminal. They are just like the criminals who traffic individuals or sell children, or murder. ""They are thoroughly unpleasant people. There is no romanticism in anyway that should be connected to it."" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Paula Hancocks and Teresa Martini contributed to this report.",0.75117457,374

The painting, ""Portrait of a Musician Playing a Bagpipe,"" was done in 1632 by an unknown painter from the Northern Netherlandish school, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in southern New York. It was owned by Max Stern, an art dealer who had a gallery in Dusseldorf, Germany, until 1937, when the Nazis' Reich Chamber for Fine Arts ordered him to liquidate the gallery and its inventory, the statement said. Stern, who died in 1987, left no heirs. He and his wife had founded the Max Stern Art Restitution Project, which directly benefits Concordia University and McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, according to a statement from U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The painting was returned Tuesday -- Holocaust Remembrance Day -- to Clarence Epstein of Concordia University on behalf of the executors of the estate, said Lou Martinez of the immigration agency. It was returned in a ceremony at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York, he said.

11,"London, England (CNN) -- A British auction house plans to sell off newly discovered sketches done by Adolf Hitler when he was a struggling student trying desperately to get into art school. The 12 charcoal and crayon sketches cover ""typical student subjects"" and don't display a great deal of promise, Mullock's Auctioneers said. They include two drawings of an elderly woman thought to be Hitler's mother, as well as studies of objects, landscapes, models, and even a Roman senator. All are signed and some even have Hitler's Vienna address, Mullock's said. The sale also includes the original portfolio in which Hitler kept the sketches, which is signed and has his address, Mullock's said. ""They look quite typical of an aspiring student hoping to get into art school -- tentative and not very certain about his perspective when he's using pencil and pen, making basic errors by getting the top and the bottom of a candlestick wrong in relation to each other, and so on,"" said Michael Liversidge, emeritus dean of arts at Bristol University in England. Letter by Hitler to Britain sells at auction . The sketches lack technical skill but are ""not so bad that one can't imagine him learning. ""But there's not latent genius here, and not much beyond a moderate school grade,"" Liversidge said. ""Probably if the artist was at school today you wouldn't encourage him to keep the subject up."" The sketches have been owned by a professional artist who had them for years in his own collection and for his own interest, said Richard Westwood-Brookes, the historical documents expert at Mullock's. The artist brought the works to Mullock's attention. Mullock's plans to auction the sketches April 15 in Ludlow, England, about 125 miles northwest of London. They're expected to bring between £4,000 and £6,000 (about $6,100 and $9,100) each, the auction house said. The drawings all date from around 1908 and 1909, when Hitler was a ""penniless dropout"" trying to get accepted into the prestigious Vienna Academy of Fine Arts to train as a professional artist, Mullock's said. The school rejected him twice, so Hitler hung around the city, trying to make a living producing watercolors to sell to tourists, Mullock's said. The rejection by the academy may have had huge implications for Hitler later in life, Westwood-Brookes said. ""Many believe that it was this rejection that turned his mind and unleashed the monster within him, which was to bring forth so much evil on the world,"" he said. ""... In a sense, therefore, the academic decision of the art establishment in Vienna can go down as one of the most monumental decisions in all of history."" Nevertheless, Westwood-Brookes said, ""On the evidence of these sketches, you can see why the Vienna Academy turned him away.""",0.7111737,9578

But while Tiananmen served as the catalyst, the oil painting should not be seen as depicting what happened at Tiananmen, the Beijing-based artist said this week through a translator in a phone interview.

""I want the audience not to think of one thing or one place or one event,"" he said from his Beijing home. ""The whole world's the background."" The red building, he explains, is simply something that's familiar to him as a Chinese artist. ""As I said, the viewer should not link this painting to Tiananmen. But Tiananmen is the catalyst for conceiving of this painting."" The background may make people think of Tiananmen because he is a Chinese artist. ""But it should not be,"" he said. Yue painted ""Execution"" in a month -- in 1995. However, ""it took me quite a long time for me to put the idea together."" The big picture, he said, ""it's on the whole world's human conflict that is worth laughing about."" Drawing references to Francisco de Goya's ""The Third of May, 1808: The Execution of the Defenders of Madrid"" and Edouard Manet's ""The Execution of the Emperor Maximilien of Mexico,"" the painting depicts a mock execution. Manet, it must be pointed out, modeled his painting after Goya's; and Yue's ""Execution"" mirrors both of those -- but with his trademark grinning clones, all likenesses of Yue himself. And the men in the position of being shot are shown in their underwear. ""People feel freedom, most themselves, at home in their underpants,"" Yue said. And whereas in Goya's painting, the man's hands are up in resistance, the men's hands in ""Execution"" are down. ""They are not fearing death,"" Yue said. ""The laughs illustrate my deep feelings,"" he said. The viewer will feel happiness but also fear toward the future and the unknown, a universal sentiment, he said. ""One might be very happy now but always unsure of what's going to happen next. ""I think Chinese and the world have similar feelings in this respect,"" he said. As for the main figures that dominate the right-half of the painting, they assume the position of holding the guns, but without the guns themselves. ""In my painting, they're pretending to hold guns, as if playing a game."" The man on the far right, holding one hand to his chest and another by his waist, is a direct reference to the man on the far right-hand side of Manet's painting: In that, he is cocking a gun. Yue disagrees with the notion that his paintings are a veiled criticism of his government or of Chinese society, and he does not believe that this work will bring him trouble. ""I think the painting expresses my feelings. It's not a criticism,"" he said, describing himself as not having strong political leanings. ""I was trying to express my confusion over what I see."" The world has similar problems, he said. Yue said he does not agree with being tagged a ""Cynical Realist,"" a term coined by leading art critic Li Xianting to describe China's post-Tiananmen generation of disillusioned artists. At the same time, he doesn't concern himself about what people call him, he said. That his painting has political undertones is inevitable, he said. ""I cannot recall any event that has shaped my political views, but politics is everywhere in Chinese life, like the meal you eat every day,"" he said. Of China, he said, ""I think it is full of hope, but there are a lot of difficulties, too. China has a long cultural history and also faces a lot of problems right now. Right now, people are not satisfied, but we can find our way out."" Yue sold ""Execution"" to Hong Kong art dealer Manfred Schoeni shortly after painting it. ""It sold for about $5,000,"" Yue said. ""Probably not any cent would come back to me,"" he said of the millions his paintings now garner at auctions. Now 45, Yue said he learned about other artists through reading books after 1978, when China had begun to open itself up under new leader Deng Xiaoping's ""Open Door policy."" The decade-long Cultural Revolution that had preceded made reading books an impossibility. And what is the meaning behind the cloned figures that bear his likeness in all his paintings? ""Because I want to be famous.""",0.7083042,6943

Andy Warhol is one of the artists in Brandeis University's acclaimed Rose Art Museum. Brandeis University, in Waltham, Massachusetts, will be taking an extraordinary step to preserve its educational mission -- the school's board of trustees voted Monday to close its acclaimed Rose Art Museum. The university will sell every one of the approximately 6,000 items in the museum, opened in 1961. ""These are extraordinary times, we cannot control or fix the nation's economic problems,"" university president Jehuda Reinharz said. ""We can only do what we have been entrusted to do -- act responsibly with the best interests of our students and their futures foremost in mind."" University spokesman Dennis Nealon said that the move to sell off the museum's exhibits was ""a very hard and painful decision"" but a necessary one for the school's survival. He said the decision, which calls for the museum to close in the summer, will not affect the university's ""commitment to the arts and the teaching of the arts."" The facility will become a fine arts teaching center with an exhibition gallery and studio space, he said. The museum's collection includes iconic paintings by such luminaries of American art as Andy Warhol, James Rosenquist, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Alex Katz and Roy Lichtenstein. Nealon said most of the museum's acquisitions are paintings and sculptures. The school has not undertaken a recent appraisal of the works, Nealon said, adding that the process may take as much as two years to complete.

15,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rarely seen portrait of Michael Jackson is on display inside a Harlem luxury car dealership. Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled ""The Book"" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat. The oil painting titled ""The Book"" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. A different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting. The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. The 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored. The painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's. The painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns. It returned to the showroom floor Monday morning. Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967. He said Abrams hopes the painting in some way can raise money for charities in the Harlem neighborhood. Dancy said Abrams is not necessarily interested in selling the portrait. When news broke about the resurfacing of the painting, Dancy said, he received a phone call from representatives of Livingstone-Strong, the artist. Now, Dancy said, ""We are in the middle of possibly putting together the artist with the painting again. Maybe for some auctions or charitable shows or something of the sort."" The showroom features Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and other pricey cars and is famous for its celebrity clientele.",0.694211,5385

17,"HONG KONG, China (CNN)  -- Bamboo, woven into the shape of human stomachs. Red, sky blue and orange pencil shavings glued onto a large canvas form a woman's traditional hair clip. A collage of magazine clippings, drawings and found materials depict Cambodia's tumultuous modern history. Leang Seckon's ""Prison Guard"" depicts Duch, who is facing a genocide tribunal starting Tuesday. These are a few of the offerings on hand in Hong Kong at one of the first large international exhibitions of artists from Cambodia. The work by 14 artists varies in practice-- video, photography, collage, wood shavings, paper, bamboo and painting-- as well as in themes, from reflecting on the Southeast Asian nation's genocidal Khmer Rouge regime to the emerging modern Cambodia, with traffic lights and all. ""Every artist in this show is referencing ancient tradition and recent history,"" said Phnom Penh-based curator Erin Gleeson, noting the wall-size depiction in folded paper of the serpent Naga (which in Cambodian culture represents the people's mythical birth) to a collage of 20th-century Cambodia and its six different regime changes. ""The show is looking at the present -- 'Forever Until Now' is the title -- and it is this lineage of the past, you see that in the show, and then you see artists that arrive at the present,"" she added. The show opens Friday and runs through March 22 at 10 Chancery Lane Gallery. Gallery owner and director Katie de Tilly said she believed it was important the artists get international exposure. "" ... it's really at the beginning of their art emergence. Obviously, they've had a very hard history,"" she said. ""This is really the beginning of contemporary Cambodians who are expressing very original ideas in their artworks and I think that that's what makes it very unique and to show to the rest of the world."" Cambodia, which lost an estimated one-quarter of its population or at least 1.7 million people -- including an estimated 90 percent of its artists -- under the 1970s Khmer Rouge regime, has a small but growing artistic community: there are some 50 practicing artists out of its 14 million people, Gleeson said. The genocide and ensuing war, which only ended in the last decade or so, stifled the development of the arts in one of the world's poorest countries. ""The legacy of that is now in every facet of a developing society,"" said Gleeson, who noted the country had no art books when she arrived in 2002 on a fellowship to teach art history. ""There's an absence of infrastructure for them, there's an absence of materials, there is no art store. ... they are quite inventive about mixing materials to make them of a higher quality or last longer, but in many cases they don't know archival techniques."" The harsh weather conditions -- a dusty, hot season and a rainy monsoon -- add to the trying work conditions. ""Everything's against them,"" she added. ""Their parents in many cases are coming from a really disadvantaged background, as the majority of the country is economically."" Some of the art included in the show looks at the Cambodia of today, such as Leang Seckon's ""Three Greens"" -- an acrylic painting showing children in school uniform crossing a road with a yellow light, red light and three green lights, along with cows and roosters. The piece shows the changes in a country that recently got stop lights, with animals, people and traffic mingling on the main roads of the capital. Sopheap Pich, a Cambodian-American whose family migrated to the U.S. in 1984, works with bamboo and rattan -- materials often used in Cambodian traditional farming and crafts -- to make sculptures. His work, ""Cycle 2,"" is the joining of the stomachs of an infant and an elderly person that for him brought up ideas of Cambodian traditional village life. ""You belong to each other, you help each other out,"" he said. ""But also, if you look at the lines and you see how it's shaped by hand, it's not very perfect, so it's also about struggle... ""You could say it's a cycle of trying to hold onto each other, now we are living everywhere in the world, Cambodians are all over the planet,"" he added. ""All this technique and pattern that I am quite obsessed with ... it's about this idea of trying to hold on with very simple means."" Chan Dany, a 25-year-old artist who graduated from one of the country's three art schools, creates textured patterns that appear almost like tapestry using pencil shavings in various colors. The works on display in the show are from a series based on Cambodian architectural decor, such as door and window shutter carvings, and include ancient Khmer forms whose shapes are derived from nature. ""When I started learning art, the teacher introduced a lot of new ways of making art, new ideas that were very difficult for me, so I had to think a lot,"" he said through a translator. ""So then I looked around at what my classmates were doing and I started to think about what they weren't using for their work, so I started to collect the things that they didn't use when they were making art and started to think about my way of making art using those materials."" ""I like the first piece I did (using the pencil shaving technique) because I had never done it this way before and since then I kept on making it,"" he said. The younger artists ""seem to be expressing something more fresh,"" while the work by artists from the older generation is ""much more heavy,"" de Tilly said. Some of the works of the Khmer Rouge period include a painting by Vann Nath, one of seven people to survive the regime's infamous S-21 torture prison. His painting, ""Pray for Peace,"" depicts women wearing traditional Cambodian funeral scarves praying en masse under troubled skies by stormy seas. Another work, Leang's ""Prison Guard,"" tells the life of Duch, a former teacher who ran S-21 and goes on trial Tuesday before a U.N.-backed tribunal on charges that include crimes against humanity. The art scene has been growing slowly in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh over the last few years: Sopheap started a group to promote contemporary Cambodian art practices and two art institutes offer programs apart from the Royal University of Fine Arts. One factor that has also made Cambodian contemporary artists different from their counterparts, for example in neighboring Vietnam, has been the lack of outside influence, such as was the case with Chinese contemporary art 30 years ago, de Tilly said. ""Cambodia still is very much influenced by itself and so the development is happening on a slower pace but as well very interesting,"" she said. ""They seem to not have as much international exposure to materials, magazines, publications, so you really do feel -- it was the same just after the Cultural Revolution in China -- that they didn't have exposure to many publications and things, and so their art was developing at that moment in time."" "" ... it's very interesting to document it and see what's going to happen in the future,"" she said. Part of the exhibit will be shown at another of the gallery's venues in Hong Kong and will run through April 25.",0.6886748,1756
18,"PARIS, France (CNN) -- A Pablo Picasso sketchbook with 33 pencil drawings disappeared from a locked glass case in a museum in Paris overnight, the French Ministry of Culture announced Tuesday.

The sketchbook has a red varnished cover with the word ""Album"" inscribed on it in gold lettering, and measures 16 centimeters by 24 centimeters (6 inches by 9 inches). Picasso used the sketchbook between 1917 and 1924 when he was in his late 30s and early 40s. The period was extraordinarily eventful for the artist, including collaborations and tours with the Ballets Russes, his marriage to Olga Khokhlova, a dancer from the company, and the birth of his son Paul.

19,"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- On the eve of what was to become the biggest sale ever of a Chinese contemporary painting, Trevor Simon wanted to get the word out about ""Execution,"" a painting he had hidden from everybody. The painting had been stored in a  London warehouse for more than a decade after arriving from Hong Kong. ""Not a single person in the world had seen it other than me for more than a decade,"" said the 36-year-old investment banking strategist by phone from London on Thursday. That includes his mother and the woman he loves. Beijing artist Yue Minjun's painting, inspired by the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen Square in 1989, sold for 2.9 million pounds ($5.9 million) Friday night in London. The sale exceeded the 2.15 million pounds ($4.37 million) paid in June for the previous record, Yue's ""The Pope."" Simon remembers seeing the oil painting at Manfred Schoeni's gallery in Hong Kong during the late 1990s and how it fascinated him at first sight. ""As soon as I saw it, my whole self changed,"" he said. ""I realized that this stood for everything that was going on at the time, so I was stunned into silence literally. I saw what was happening in China. I was rising in banking, and I saw an execution of people who were smiling. ""I saw that was what was going on in banking."" Schoeni and Simon were already on friendly terms, and Schoeni had wanted to show him ""Execution,"" which had been covered up. But when Simon insisted he wanted the painting, he recalled Schoeni telling him it wasn't going anywhere and was not for sale. But Simon said he would not leave and remembered saying: "" 'Fine, have a drink with me.' And maybe I loosened his head a bit. After a couple hours, I struck a deal."" A junior investment banker in his 20s at the time, Simon would spend $250,000 Hong Kong dollars ($32,200), or two-thirds of his annual salary, on ""Execution."" The painting reflected what he felt was going on in the world in which he worked: a soulless place. ""While you can apply a good mind, the job eats your life. You spend 14 hours in the markets. A week in Paris, a week in London running around. No life. My girlfriend didn't want to be with me: 'I can't have you.'"" She'd leave him and has since become engaged to someone else, he said. ""It was not only an image of an execution of characters in front of the walls of Tiananmen, but an execution of me,"" he said, describing himself as ""committed to this painting."" Under the terms of the deal he struck with Schoeni, the painting was to be ""out of sight for five years"" and shipped to London, Simon explained. He described the painting -- at 3 meters (10 feet) wide and 1.5 meters (5 feet) high -- as ""monumental,"" ""physical,"" and ""like a wall."" He put ""Execution"" in a box, shipped it out of Hong Kong to London. ""And it hasn't moved since that day. It's in a crusty warehouse behind a main road."" He finds a key distinction between ""Execution"" and Francisco de Goya's ""The Third of May, 1808: The Execution of the Defenders of Madrid"" and Edouard Manet's ""The Execution of the Emperor Maximilien of Mexico."" In those, he said, ""that's murder, true assassination of a political figure. But here [with ""Execution""], it's far more potent. Because they're killed by culture."" The laughing was a ""response to unimaginable persecution,"" he said. ""You don't know what the hell else to do. You're nervous. You're not laughing, 'Ha ha hee hee.'"" As for the underwear, Simon said, ""You're stripped down, you're defenseless. Even worse, you're being shot with cultural forces, not bullets."" And while the man on the far right of Manet's painting cocks the gun and delivers the coup de grace, the figure in ""Execution"" has a similar role, said Simon. ""He's wearing a generic T-shirt -- the guy who's delivering the last shot to be delivered into the heartland of Chinese heritage."" Yue's painting was in keeping with ""cynical realism,"" the term coined by art critic Li Xianting to describe post-Tiananmen artists disillusioned by and critical of Chinese society, Simon said. When asked if he, as a young 20-something, ever harbored doubts or questioned his sanity about dishing out a large portion of his salary for this work, Simon replied: ""No, no, no, no. I knew. I stood there. You just know. You just absolutely know beyond all doubt that the theme is something special. ""This art was a representation of all the ambition and all the anxiety that had been held back behind the Chinese wall and was now allowed to live, allowed to go free. ""I knew without a millionth of a doubt that that was the story of China on canvas."" Simon said he would probably cry if he and Yue met. ""He's an immensely brave man, anyone who paints like this. None of his paintings are as politically dangerous as this."" Simon left the painting in a box in the warehouse and never brought it out or hung it up, despite having other work elsewhere in his house. For one thing, Schoeni was murdered in 2004 in the Philippines. Simon felt that it was because Schoeni was involved in championing the works of people from ""repressive"" countries. The painting became a mental crutch for him. He determined that he would walk out on the most important job he could think of in investment banking, one that earned him more than a million dollars a year. ""The painting helped me leave the job because I could see a country being executed and surviving, and so maybe I could too,"" he said in a follow-up email. Simon had left Hong Kong for ""the lion's den,"" as he put it, in London, where he felt further ""executed by the politics and chaos one step below the top rung of the bank."" The very top was where the more rational and humanity prevailed, he said. ""All the rest is scratching and positioning and seldom is the best thing done."" He'd leave his job. That was five years ago, and while he is still involved in finance, he works on his own now, he said. Selling the painting brings Simon full circle to being ""un-Executed,"" he said. Yue's got a new museum and is being recognized by the Chinese government. ""He's no longer repressed by China. And I'm no longer repressed by commercial ambition. It's about doing it the right way,"" Simon said. ""The value of this piece is not the dollar value. It's lovely to have that extra money. But the real value, should I die tomorrow morning, has already been placed in my heart,"" he said. ""I'm not laughing at being shot at. What I'm most proud of is the courage to live.

20,"(CNN) -- Gunpowder, fireworks and attention-grabbing installations mark Cai Guo-Qiang as one of the world's biggest and brightest artists. Cai's fireworks will be seen by millions during the Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. The Chinese artist is about to show the world what he can do with a spectacular pyrotechnics display at the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing. Despite not having lived in China since 1986, Cai has been selected to be the Director of Visual and Special Effects for both the opening and closing ceremonies at the Games. For the 51-year-old contemporary artist, whose work has previously caused controversy in China, the politics that have been swirling around the Games are secondary to the event itself. ""In any country, in any city, there will be political influence on what is said, what kind of images are to be projected and, yes, of course artists can be and are influenced by politicians,"" he told CNN. ""But what I also think is that our leaders at the very highest level want artists to be able to be free, to be creative and to show this other side of China that is vibrant."" While some of his art is politically charged, Cai has established his reputation as much as a director of the spectacular, with his work often providing a visceral and visual bang. He studied stage design at the Shanghai Drama Institute between 1981 and 1985 before moving to Japan a year after graduation. Now residing in New York, he gained wide-spread international recognition at the Venice Biennale in 1999, winning the Golden Lion prize. However, the work he displayed -- Rent Collection Courtyard, a replica of famous Chinese socialist-realist sculpture -- upset artists of the original piece in Shanghai who believed it diminished the sentiment behind the original work. Born in Fujian in 1957, Cai's father was also an artist, but had a much more traditional outlook than the one Cai developed. ""He and his friends always lamented about the good days and, that there's no vitality in today's art and culture. So, I really rebelled against that. I felt that what they were talking about had very little to do with how our lives were like at that moment,"" he said. Cai began using gunpowder in his work after moving to Japan. Detonating large trails of it on his two-dimensional pieces, creating small mushroom-clouds, or lighting enormous firework displays, explosions have been a continuous theme of his work. ""I have always been a coward as a child. I am not very brave. I am very aware of the fact that I am not very gutsy. So, I am always trying to do things to kind of boost my own sense of courage a bit. So maybe that is why I use gunpowder,"" he told CNN. Cai has proffered different explanations for different projects that feature the same motifs. Perhaps that is not surprising when his influences come from a myriad of sources that include Taoism, Buddhist philosophy and UFO-observations. Recently exhibited at New York's Guggenheim Museum, ""Inopportune: Stage One"" is a set of 9 cars suspended above each other with illuminated shards shooting out. Cai has previously said it denotes Chinese craftiness in stealing western technology, while arrows piercing the life-sized stuffed tigers of ""Inopportune: Stage 2"" are also about the aesthetics of pain. ""For me cars are tigers, they are all bodies of the human form and it is a human form I am working with through this medium. For the cars the energy goes inward out and for the tiger piece the energy flows in,"" he told CNN. Meanings and interpretations then can be fluid, but as well as the explosions and visual excitement, there is a common social theme in his work. The most connected to this ethos is ""Reflection-A Gift from Iwaki 2004."" The skeleton of a wooden boat found off the coast of Iwaki, Japan, that spills delicate pieces of porcelain from its hull is recreated piece by piece by the people who helped excavate it. ""This work and the history of this work belongs to the people of Iwaki and me. It is a shared experience, a shared history,"" he said. ""Some works of art have material other works have form, but this piece has something additional, it has a narrative, it has a story that is just as important as the material and form itself."" Ultimately the most unifying and social part of his work is the spectacle of it all. Everyone loves fireworks, and if Cai's own careful planning and that of the Games organizers come together, he should provide a fitting opening and finale to the world's biggest spectacle.",0.65642166,4516

""Figures are chosen for their popularity or for their influence on the path of history -- for better or for worse. Adolf Hitler stands for a decisive part of Berlin's history, which cannot be denied."" Saturday was the opening day of the Berlin branch of the famous Madame Tussauds wax museum. The presence of the waxwork, which depicted the Nazi dictator sitting at his desk in his bunker shortly before he committed suicide in 1945, in the new museum led to criticism in German media over recent weeks. But the museum's defenders argued Hitler's role in German history must not be ignored. Hitler was shown with a sullen expression, his head slightly down, and one hand on the desk. Berlin is the eighth wax museum for London-based Madame Tussauds, known for its lifelike waxworks depicting famous people including celebrities, politicians, sports stars, artists, and scientists. Famous Germans included in the exhibits are Chancellor Angela Merkel, scientist Albert Einstein, composer Johann Sebastian Bach, and tennis champion Boris Becker.

22,"(CNN) -- Andrew Wyeth, the American painter perhaps best known for his painting of a young woman in a field, ""Christina's World,"" has died, according to an official with the Brandywine River Museum in Pennsylvania. Andrew Wyeth received the National Medal of Arts from President Bush in November 2007. Wyeth, 91, died in his sleep Thursday night at his home near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to Lora Englehart, public relations coordinator for the museum. The acclaimed artist painted landscapes and figure subjects and worked mostly in tempera and watercolor. He was widely celebrated inside and outside of the art world. Wyeth received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and President Nixon sponsored an exhibition of Wyeth's paintings at the White House. In 2007, President Bush awarded Wyeth the National Medal of Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and contribution to American arts and culture. Two years earlier, Wyeth and his wife, Betsy, presented to the White House his painting ""Jupiter,"" which is displayed in the residence's family sitting room. Bush issued a statement Friday saying that he and first lady Laura Bush ""deeply mourn"" the death of Wyatt. ""Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native Pennsylvania and Maine,"" Bush said. ""On behalf of the American people, Laura and I offer our sincere condolences to Betsy and the Wyeth family."" Wyeth, who lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Maine, ""has been enormously popular and critically acclaimed since his first one-man show in 1937,"" according to a biography in InfoPlease. His main subjects were the places and people of Chadds Ford and Cushing, Maine. ""Christina's World,"" painted in 1948, shows a disabled Maine neighbor who drags herself through a field toward her house in the distance. The painting, displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, has been regarded as Wyeth's most popular. ""His 'Helga' pictures, a large group of intimate portraits of a neighbor, painted over many years, were first shown publicly in 1986,"" the InfoPlease biography says. Those were painted in Pennsylvania. Wyeth, the youngest child of painter N.C. Wyeth, formally studied art with his father as a teen, ""drawing in charcoal and painting in oils, the media of choice for N.C. Wyeth. It was during the family's annual summer vacations in Port Clyde, Maine, that Andrew was able to experiment with other media to find his own artistic voice,"" according to a biography in the Farnsworth Art Museum in Maine.",0.6518978,2250
23,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz could lose the right to her entire portfolio of world-famous photographs if she doesn't meet a Tuesday deadline to pay back a $24 million loan she is alleged to owe. Annie Leibovitz appears before her photo of Demi Moore during an exhibition of her work in June in Madrid, Spain. Leibovitz, who has photographed everyone from the Rolling Stones to Queen Elizabeth II, put her art, intellectual property and even real estate assets up for collateral last year when she consolidated her massive debts. Art Capital Group, which restructured the debts, says Leibovitz agreed ""to make Art Capital her 'irrevocable exclusive agent'"" of the assets ""in exchange for a reduced interest rate on the loan."" Now the company is suing Leibovitz for breach of contract, saying she has ""refused to cooperate in the sale of those assets,"" according to a question-and-answer sheet on the lawsuit issued by Art Capital. It also says she has ""refused to pay to Art Capital hundreds of thousands of dollars she owed as part of the same agreement."" Asked by CNN for comment, Leibovitz's attorney, Steven Brawer, said, ""I don't have anything I can tell you."" They have until October 1 to respond to the lawsuit. In the question-and-answer sheet, Art Capital says Leibovitz ""acknowledged that in order to repay the loan she would sell her fine art, intellectual property and real estate assets. She authorized Art Capital to act as agent in the sale of those assets through which Art Capital could recoup its decrease in interest rate. She would have realized a significant gain from that sale."" It says the loan agreement gave Art Capital ""the right to sell the collateral before the loan came due on September 8 and for a two-year period thereafter."" One of Leibovitz's best known photos is of John Lennon with his wife, Yoko Ono, shortly before the Beatles star was assassinated in 1980. She is no stranger to controversy. In 1991, Leibovitz photographed a nude and extremely pregnant Demi Moore for the cover of Vanity Fair. The issue, considered scandalous at the time, was sold in many places nationwide with a sheath of white paper. Last year, Leibovitz photographed Disney star Miley Cyrus wrapped in a bedsheet, eliciting claims that the photographer pressured the teen queen into poses that were too provocative for her young age. In July, Art Capital filed a complaint with the New York Supreme Court, asking it to uphold the sales agreement it signed with Leibovitz, including its right to sell her art and real estate. If the court agrees with Art Capital, it means Leibovitz could end up owing far more than she did originally. Art Capital has asked for an unspecified amount of damages in addition to the money it says the photographer originally borrowed. Art Capital -- through its affiliate, American Photography -- provides financial and consulting services to artists, galleries and art owners, and offers loans based on their intellectual property and fine art assets.",0.64348614,6128
24,"London, England (CNN) -- Sherlock Holmes the movie has already made more than $300 million at the box office worldwide and British tourism officials are hoping it means money for them too. Britain's tourism board has been promoting films for the past 15 years, so they know just how lucrative a movie like ""Sherlock Homes"" can be. ""To give you an example of a typical blockbuster film, it is normally seen by about 120 million people in the first three weeks of opening,"" Visit Britain official Laurence Bresh told CNN. ""Even if a small percentage of those come to visit Britain as a result of this particular film, that's going to have a huge boost in some of those tourism attractions featured in our promotion."" As much of ""Sherlock Holmes"" is set in London this means big business for museum officials and gift shop operators. The Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221b Baker Street is the address where the fictional detective lived, according to the stories by Conan Doyle. Nearby, a nine-foot statue of Holmes greets visitors at the Baker Street Underground station. Inside the museum, visitors can check out Holmes' study, sit in his armchair by the fireside, examine his calabash pipe and observe his chemistry equipment. ""I think Hollywood has put its magic touch on the legend, and they've put, as it were, a magnifying glass over the character and of course things you could say are slightly exaggerated, but that's the wont of Hollywood and that's what makes these blockbusters successful,"" John Riley, Assistant Curator of the Sherlock Holmes Museum said. ""So any new perspective, any new angle always just helps to perpetuate the legend of Sherlock Holmes. And that indirectly will obviously benefit the museum."" About 70,000 visitors a year stop by the Victorian lodging house, though officials are expecting a spike of interest fueled by the new movie. While thousands of tourists flock to visit the museum, many of its visitors are unaware that Sherlock Holmes was actually not real person. ""A few people do think he is a real character, particularly with the tour of his house on 'Baker Street' adding fuel to the fire so to speak,"" Mark Di-Toro from Visit Britain said. ""That is just testament to Doyle's brilliant writing with his true to nature locations in the books meaning tourist can really relate and visit all the fantastic locations."" A.

The 50-meter high horse will dominate the landscape around Ebbsfleet. The 50-meter equine artwork was Tuesday announced as the winner of a competition to design a landmark to dominate the skyline of the Ebbsfleet Valley, set to be a new stop on the Eurostar London-to-Paris rail link. Designed by artist Mark Wallinger -- whose previous work has included dressing in a bear suit and wandering around a gallery in Berlin -- the £2 million ($3 million) horse will be one of the largest artworks in the UK. Wallinger's horse -- which echoes ancient white horse symbols carved into hillsides around Britain -- beat a shortlist of designs that included a tower of stacked cubes and giant steel nest. Victoria Pomery, head of the panel that selected the design, described the 33-times normal size horse as ""outstanding."" ""Mark is a superb artist of world renown and his sculpture will become a real landmark for Ebbsfleet Valley and the whole region,"" she said. It drew a less favorable response from readers of local Web site Kentnews.com, who described it as a ""waste of money,"" an ""abomination"" and ""depressing.""

27,"LONDON, England -- A Colombian sculptor has created a mystery at London's Tate Modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor. ""Shibboleth"" is Colombian artist Doris Salcedo's first public commission in the United Kingdom. The work by Doris Salcedo begins as a hairline crack then widens and deepens as it snakes across the full 167 meters (548 feet) of the former power station's Turbine Hall. Salcedo said ""Shibboleth,"" a statement about racism, took her more than a year to make but has revealed little else about its construction. She apparently created it elsewhere and spent the past five weeks installing it in the Tate, on the south bank of the River Thames. She refused to say how she managed seemingly to crack open a concrete floor. ""What is important is the meaning of the piece. The making of it is not important,"" she said. Asked how deep the crack goes, she replied: ""It's bottomless. It's as deep as humanity."" Visitors meanwhile are warned not to trip on the crack. Tate director Nicholas Serota insisted the work was no optical illusion. ""This sculpture has been made in the most painstaking, meticulous way by Doris and her team before it was slowly inserted into the Turbine Hall,"" he told the Press Association. ""It has taken five weeks of work here with very considerable disruption to the hall. It's not an illusion - it's there, it's real. ""From the Tate's point of view, there were only two questions: could we realize it in the way Doris envisaged? And once the piece was created, would it damage the structural integrity of the building forever? ""The answer to the first was yes, and to the second was no."" He declined to elaborate further. The installation will be removed next April by filling in the crack. Serota said: ""There is a crack, there is a line, and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain. It will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial to the issues Doris touches on."" The artist said the work of art represents the gap between white Europeans and the rest of humanity. Wire mesh is on show because it is ""the most common means of control used to define borders and divisions."" Salcedo said of the work: ""It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. ""It is the experience of a Third World person coming into the heart of Europe. ""For example, the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.""

28,"(CNN) -- One man's trash is another man's mystery. Nick DiMola holds what he believes are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts from Mexico. Five years ago, Nick DiMola's rubbish removal company was hired to clean out a Manhattan apartment following the death of the owner, abstract artist Clinton Hill. The contents of a barrel that DiMola salvaged from the trash then has today raised a series of questions. What DiMola holds are about 60 artifacts and pieces of artifacts that he thinks are from Mexico, dating to between 300 B.C. and 500 A.D. The mystery, which the Mexican Consulate in New York is trying to solve, is twofold: How much are the artifacts worth? And, if authentic, whom do they belong to? DiMola first saw the collection of pottery and figurines while cleaning Hill's apartment in 2004. He stored the barrel in his warehouse instead of disposing of it, then promptly forgot about it. Last week, DiMola rediscovered the pieces, only this time he told the New York Daily News about what he had found, announcing that he would sell them. That caught the attention of the Mexican government, which is studying the origins of the items and has claimed them. Now, DiMola wants to donate his find, but not necessarily to Mexico, he told CNN. The Queens native was excited about his discovery when he allowed representatives from the Mexican Cultural Institute to examine and photograph nearly all the pieces, DiMola said. His curiosity about them was growing, and he was expecting an appraisal from the government officials. What he got instead was a heads-up about a possible petition to return the entire collection to Mexico. ""My reaction is that that is not very diplomatic,"" DiMola said. ""It's a blow to the jaw."" Ruben Beltran, Mexico's consul general in New York, was not available for comment Tuesday. However in an interview with the U.S.-based Spanish-language TV network Telemundo, he said that if the pieces are part of Mexican culture, the government will try to get them back. But as of now, no one is certain what the pieces are. Howard Nowes, an ancient art dealer who does appraisals, examined a handful of the pieces that DiMola holds. Nowes told CNN he saw a mix of authentic and non-authentic pre-Columbian pieces, which he valued at $3,000. The pieces were broken and weren't very artistic, he said, adding ""from what I can see, it was mostly junk."" Unfazed, DiMola thinks all the pieces probably are worth more than $16,000 total, he said. ""Something like this, you can't put a price on, because I may have a figure that no one has seen before,"" DiMola said. ""There's a big value in these pieces."" The Mexican government isn't taking any chances, and is conducting its own research into the authenticity and significance of the pieces. Museums in Houston, Texas; San Francisco, California and Washington, D.C., have expressed interest in the pieces as well, DiMola said. He said he'd like to donate the artifacts to museums across the country, and some to the Mexican Cultural Institute at the Mexican Consulate in New York City, but that could change if Mexico uses international law to claim the items. The foundation that hired DiMola to clean the house is unlikely to try to reclaim the pieces, said John Koegel, the attorney who handled Hill's estate. When Hill died, he left all his possessions to his lifelong partner, Allen Tran, Koegel told CNN. In turn, Tran bequeathed all of Hill's possessions to a foundation ""to carry out his artistic legacy,"" he said. Hill had some pieces from Mexico in his apartment that were cataloged, but the artist had no strong connection to the country, Koegel said. For DiMola, all the fuss stems from a simple truth. ""Sometimes you find things that are good and salvageable in the trash,"" he said.",0.63556623,5410
29,"(CNN) -- If a bed and 14 other antiques up for sale in New York next week look familiar, it might be that you saw them in a movie. An American Renaissance gilt, carved, inlaid and ebonized bed is expected to go for $500,000. Pieces of furniture owned by two very rich 19th-century Americans were destined for a trash pile before they were rescued for the silver screen. They will find new life on the auction block next week. Made by the Herter Brothers in the 1870s, the furniture sat in Warner Brothers' Hollywood props department since 1942, when the studio bought it at an estate auction for a fraction of the original cost. Warner Brothers, owned by CNN parent Time Warner Inc., could get $2 million from the auction, and it means valuable space will be cleared out in the props department storage. One studio source said using such expensive -- although authentic -- props on movie sets doesn't make business sense. Jon King, director of Bonham's, the New York auction house that will put the furniture on sale next Thursday, said he did not have the studio's permission to reveal in which movies the furniture might have been used. You can watch post-1942 Warner Brothers period films to find them. ""You have to go slow-motion and stop and start an awful lot,"" King said. ""I would imagine that if any of these were in movies they might steal the scene away from the actors,"" said King, an expert in 19th-century furniture. A New York Times article about the furniture, published in 1995, said it appeared in Warner Brother's ""Saratoga Trunk,"" a 1945 movie starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. Few records were kept over the decades to track the pieces' appearances, a studio source said. King said he saw Herter Brothers furniture from the same estate in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" filmed in 1960 on Universal's lots. Universal bought its furniture at the same 1942 estate auction that Warner Brothers attended. The studio sold its collection years ago, King said. The furniture -- in American Renaissance and American Aesthetic styles -- was made with ""very exotic and very expensive materials"" for two very rich California men -- Gov. Milton Slocum Latham and railroad magnate Mark Harper, King said. The most dramatic piece is an ornate bed commissioned for the master bedroom at Latham's Menlo Park, California, home. It could sell for $500,000, King said. ""A lot of people in the field regard that as the finest bed ever made in the 19th century in America,"" King said. ""Basically, the quality of carving and the number of things going on in there in the bed, it's just amazing."" Changing times and tastes made the furniture obsolete for anything but a period movie by 1942. Movie studios were scouring the country for cheap furniture for their props departments, King said. But recent decades have see a steep rise in values for Herter Brothers craftwork, he said. King said next week's sale is significant for collectors because ""this is the last studio collection."" The Herter Brothers -- German immigrants who set up their furniture-making shop in New York City after the Civil War -- also made furniture for the White House, where some pieces remain.",0.6205835,2740
30,"(CNN) -- Famous for honest self-portraits, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo said that she painted her reality and that her paintings carried a message of pain. Her life was full of it, both physical and emotional, and she used it to fuel her art. Frida Kahlo was born in this house and lived in it with her husband, Diego Rivera. Much can be learned about both her private and public life by visiting the home she shared, first with her parents and later with her painter husband, Diego Rivera. The bold blue house with red trim stands out in the quiet residential street of the Coyoacán section of Mexico City. It was painted that way because Kahlo and Rivera felt that the bright colors represented Mexican culture better than the original white paint. This home-turned-museum, known as La Casa Azul, is where Frida Kahlo was born, began to paint and died, making the house a witness to one of the most important artistic lives in Mexican history. The museum entrance leads to a large patio where pre-Columbian sculptures collected by Diego Rivera throughout his lifetime are scattered among the plants and fountains. The couple's love for traditional Mexican art can be seen throughout the house, from the large fireplace designed by Rivera that dominates the first room, resembling a step pyramid like the ones built by the Mayas and Aztecs, to Kahlo's paintings and the couple's collection of smaller sculptures. Some of Kahlo's most well-known works, such as ""Viva la Vida,"" a still life of watermelons, are on display in the museum, but it is the personal objects that tell the most interesting stories. An entire room is dedicated to communist paraphernalia. Kahlo was very politically active and did not hide her political leanings. In fact, she and Rivera invited exiled Russian communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky and his wife to live with them in the late '30s. As visitors move through the museum, it is the remnants of Kahlo and Rivera's private life that begin to tell their story. Part of the collection is a bed with a mirror attached to it, used by Kahlo in order to create many of her celebrated self-portraits. At the age of 18, she was left bedridden for a few months when her spine was broken in a serious bus and trolley accident. It was during those months that Kahlo began to paint, to help pass the time and keep her spirits up. Also on view are several corsets that Kahlo had to wear during her lifetime because of lasting injuries from the accident, several surgeries and a childhood bout of polio. It was because she began painting that Kahlo met Diego Rivera, who was at the time a famous Mexican muralist. Kahlo wanted to know whether she had talent enough to make art a career, so she sought out Rivera to get his opinion. That was the start of their famously tempestuous relationship. They were married for the first time in 1929, but after infidelities on both sides (including an affair between Kahlo and Trotsky), they divorced in 1939. They were married again a year later. She once commented on their relationship, saying that there had been two great accidents in her life, the trolley and Diego; Diego, she claimed, had been the worst of the two. The house, which was witness to the birth of Kahlo on July 6, 1907, was also witness to her death July 13, 1954. Rivera put her ashes in a pre-Columbian urn, which remains in the house to this day. He donated the house in 1957, and it opened to the public as La Casa Azul, Museo Frida Kahlo in 1958. So the blue house, which has seen so much of the history of two of Mexico's most famous artists and was witness to so much of Kahlo's personal suffering, is open to the public, ready to tell their story to all who are willing to listen.",0.61864924,5858
31,"(CNN) -- At an auction at a gallery in New York recently, a piece of artwork sold for a higher price than had been anticipated by the auctioneers: $4,080. It wasn't a very big piece of art -- just 8-by-10 inches. Technically, it wasn't even art. It was a glossy black-and-white photograph. It had a slight imperfection: there were staple holes in the upper left-hand corner. Someone had written all over the front of the photograph. The person who had scrawled on it was, in fact, the subject of the photograph. He had written: . ""To Patricia Keating, with very best wishes, John Kennedy"" That is what made the photo so valuable to someone: Kennedy had held it in his hands, had run his pen over it. The owners of Swann Galleries, where the signed photo was auctioned, believe that Kennedy had autographed the picture in 1956, when he was a United States senator. The picture itself wasn't worth much; but his signature, personalized to Patricia Keating. ... ""As far as we know, she wasn't anyone famous,"" Rebecca Weiss, a Swann Galleries employee, told me on the day after the auction. ""There's no particular significance to her name."" Then why would someone pay more than $4,000 for the photo? Weiss told me that the identities of the buyers and sellers at Swann auctions are kept confidential, so she could not disclose who had consigned the photo for sale, or who had purchased it. But she said there is a pretty safe rule of thumb about the sale of autographs of renowned men and women: . ""What people are buying is the mystique. They are taking home the autograph knowing that this person once actually touched this item, this person once actually left this imprint, this signature."" She clearly knows what she is talking about; just this weekend, it was announced that another auctioneer had sold what is purported to be perhaps the last autograph Kennedy ever signed: a copy of the Dallas Morning News that he reportedly signed for a woman upon his arrival in that city on November 22, 1963. A man in California purchased it for $39,000. In our digital age, in which images and data are transferred from person to person with the tap of a key, it would seem to be an anachronism: the idea of placing enormous monetary value on pieces of paper upon which prominent individuals once wrote their names. But that personal touch seems to have remained precious; Weiss said that many, if not most, purchasers of autographed items display them as if they were rare paintings: framed and mounted in places of honor. She didn't have to convince me. I have only two pieces of art hanging in my home, and neither would qualify as art in the conventional sense. But I wouldn't trade them for Picassos or Van Goghs. The first is an original theater lobby poster for the greatest movie about newspapers ever made: 1952's ""Deadline -- U.S.A."", starring Humphrey Bogart. The other piece of art is an autograph -- actually, an entire (if brief) handwritten letter. It is a thank-you note. A thank-you note written to a laundry. At the top of the piece of paper, embossed in the italics/script font style of 1950s suburban-housewife stationery, are the words: . ""From the home of ... Elvis Presley"" And beneath it, in blue ballpoint pen: . ""I should like to commend your Laundry for doing a fantastic job on my clothes, you show esceptional care. Sincerely E.P."" That's just how, while living in a house on Audubon Drive in Memphis, Tennessee, in the years before he moved to Graceland, he wrote it. ""Laundry"" capitalized in the middle of the sentence; a comma instead of a period after ""clothes""; ""esceptional"" instead of ""exceptional."" I can't imagine a more wonderful or telling artifact from Presley's life. Who writes thank-you notes to their laundries? The young Elvis, that's who. There's such an essential sweetness to it -- to the very fact of the letter, to the formality of his introduction (""I should like to commend...""), to the adjective he chose (""a fantastic job on my clothes""). I purchased the letter from a gallery two decades ago (for a price that made me bite the inside of my mouth), and I would rather own it than the Mona Lisa. I was about to say that I would never part with it, but in fact I once did, for several months. An exhibit called ""American Originals: Treasures from the National Archives"" was touring the country, and was scheduled to make a long stop at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. Included in the exhibit were the original Louisiana Purchase Treaty, Thomas Edison's 1879 patent application for the electric lamp and the instrument of surrender of the German High Command during World War II. I thought Elvis belonged there, and persuaded the curators of the museum to accept his thank-you letter on loan. The National Archives said they would not object, so long as Elvis' note was not in the same room with the more austere documents. It worked out fine; I thought Elvis would like it that way. He always was proud to be an outsider. In the hallway adjacent to the entrance to the main exhibit -- visitors saw it right as they walked in -- was Elvis' handwritten letter, in a display case, with a plaque that read: . ""This note, written by Elvis Presley when he was on the verge of becoming a star, provides an example of how seemingly trivial documents can increase in value and cultural significance as a result of historic events. It also shows that despite his growing fame in the early 1950s, Presley cared about the feelings of others."" Brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it? I can fully understand why someone in New York the other day would purchase the photograph that John Kennedy once signed for Patricia Keating, whoever she may have been. You don't have to be Patricia Keating to comprehend the value of that picture, just as you don't have to be Elvis' laundry to comprehend the value of that thank-you note. Great art, like great beauty, is where you find it. It is, as they say, in the eye -- or the laundry bag -- of the beholder.

Fattori is one of about 300 people in Italy who do this job, but only about 50 of them have full-time contracts. She makes the equivalent of about $1,500 each month, but only works three months per year. And that is why she and others recently went on strike, demanding a full-time wage for work they say not everyone can do. ""It is not easy because you are naked, so you have to be very comfortable with your body and have a nice relationship with everybody,"" she says as the students look on, ""but not too open and not too close. You are trying to give inspiration to the students. If we lose these artistic roots that are very important to Italy then we lose a big part of our identity."" Italian Renaissance art is filled with naked men and women: Think of Michelangelo's David or Botticelli's Venus. But back then artists mostly used prostitutes and lovers as models and muses, often with the complicity of priests who wanted the walls of their churches painted by famous names. ""Priests allowed prostitutes to use churches,"" explains Enrico Bruschini, one of Rome's best known art historians. ""Officially it was to convert them, but the practical reason was to have the artist at the church."" Bruschini says that the Saint Augustine church, a stone's throw from Piazza Navona, was a famous gathering point in Rome for Renaissance artists looking for ""inspiration."" Back then though professional modeling did not exist, and most would agree that the art didn't really suffer from its absence. So if Botticelli and Raphael could do without professional models, what is the big deal now? ""It all started with the rise of art schools in the 19th and 20th centuries"" says Fattori. ""During the Renaissance you just thought that a prostitute can be a model or even a lover. But now we are here, so we need to move ahead."" Art students hoping to become the next Michelangelo agree. ""I think a person should have talent,"" argues Anastasia Kurakina, a first year student from Russia. ""Because you, for example, you couldn't [model]... I don't know you, but Anna Elisa has talent."" Anastasia is right, I certainly couldn't do it -- but unbeknownst to me she used me as a model while I was interviewing Fattori. Thankfully I was fully dressed, so all she drew was my head. And she didn't to a bad job at that. E-mail to a friend .",0.60937214,3480
34,"(Mental Floss) -- 1. The SPAM® Museum . SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig. If the on-site ""wall of SPAM"" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History . It's pretty hard to argue with the motto ""Any Day Above Ground is a Good One."" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of ""fantasy coffins"" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum . If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the ""hobo jungle,"" located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have ""caught the westbound"" are laid to rest. 4. The Mütter Museum . Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the Mütter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum . What better way to honor ""Greatest Show on Earth"" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean ""enthusiasts"") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum . There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring ""mainstream"" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices . Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum . What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum . So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum . Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T . our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

35,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the first splinters of sunlight spread their warmth on the south bank of the River Thames on Thursday, it became clear that after more than a century, the vision of Victorian engineer Alexander Stanhope St. George had finally been realized. The Telectroscope lets Londoners and New Yorkers see each other in real time. In all its optical brilliance and brass and wood, there stood the Telectroscope: an 11.2-meter-(37 feet) long by 3.3-meter-(11 feet) tall dream of a device allowing people on one side of the Atlantic to look into its person-size lens and, in real time, see those on the other side via a recently completed tunnel running under the ocean. (Think 19th-century Webcam. Or maybe Victorian-age video phone.) And all the credit goes to British artist Paul St. George. If he had not been rummaging through great-grandpa Alexander's personal effects a few years ago, the Telectroscope might still exist only on paper, hidden away deep inside some old box. But fortunately, St. George could not bear that thought and thus decided he should be the one to finish what his great-grandfather had started. It was quite simply the right thing to do. Plus, it would make a pretty cool public art exhibit. Send us your videos, images or stories . During the twilight hours Tuesday, massive dirt-covered metal drill bits miraculously emerged -- one by the Thames near the Tower Bridge and the other on Fulton Ferry Landing by the Brooklyn Bridge in New York -- completing the final sections of great-grandfather Alexander's transatlantic tunnel. The drills were removed Wednesday night and replaced with identical Telectroscopes at both ends, allowing Londoners and New Yorkers to wake up Thursday, look over to the far and distant shore and stare at each other for a while (the telescope-like contraption permits visual but not vocal communication). Of course, only part of this story is true. St. George is an artist in Britain who does have a grandfather -- minus the great prefix -- named Alexander. And the trans-Atlantic tunnel is really a trans-Atlantic broadband network rounded off on each end with HD cameras, according to Tiscali, an Italian Internet provider handling the technical side of the project. As for the Telectroscope, well, it was a fanciful idea that, according to St. George, came about from a typo made by a 19th-century reporter who misspelled Electroscope, a device used to measure electrostatic charges - as Telectroscope. ""The journalist also misunderstood what it was about and wrote in the article that it was a device for the suppression of absence,"" St. George said. ""The accidental hope captured their imagination, and lots of people at the end of the 19th century thought it was a great idea."" The Telectroscope captured St. George's imagination five years ago, when he began pondering how to do a project on the childhood fantasy of digging a hole to the opposite side of the Earth. And because the artist also happens to have an expertise in Victorian chronophotography -- a precursor to cinematography -- he had a slight idea of where to look for the proper equipment. ""We all have that idea in our head if we could make a tunnel to the other side of the Earth,"" St. George said.""But we are not all crazy enough to actually try and do it."" St. George was crazy enough to actually try and do it, but he realized he could not do the digging alone. So about two years ago, he pitched the idea to Artichoke, the British arts group responsible for taking the Sultan's Elephant -- a 42-ton mechanical creature -- for a stroll through central London in 2006. The company was immediately taken by St. George's idea. ""The whole thing is about seeing what is real and what isn't real and how the world is,"" said Nicki Webb, a co-founder of Artichoke. ""Is it nighttime when we are in daytime, and does it look familiar to us or not?"" When the sun illuminated the lens of the Telectroscope next to the Thames, it was, of course, still nighttime in New York. So the screen inside the scope broadcast back only an empty sidewalk silently framed by the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. But then something miraculous occurred. A police officer and a street cleaner walked into the frame. Stopped. And waved. The Telectroscope will be on display and open to the public 24 hours a day in London and New York until June 15. Artichoke is arranging requests to synchronize special reunions between friends and family or, the company hopes, maybe even a marriage proposal.",0.5978056,4135
36,"""Everything can be improved."" -- Ross Lovegrove . Designer Ross Lovegrove . Fiercely original and unapologetically innovative, Ross Lovegrove describes himself, somewhat reluctantly, as an industrial designer. ""It's not as grimy, it's not as deep and dark as that sounds,"" he says. Famous for his tactile and sensual fluid forms, he takes his inspiration from nature to create an organic minimalism that he calls ""fat free"" design. ""Nature is a very big part of my work and always has been. I've never seen it as a trend or a fashion,"" he told CNN. In the early 1980s, with Frog Design in West Germany, he worked on projects including Sony Walkmans and Apple computers. He later moved to Paris as a consultant to Knoll International. Since returning to London in 1986, Lovegrove has worked with a wide range of clients including Airbus Industries, Peugeot, Apple Computers, Issey Miyake, Olympus Cameras, Tag Heuer, Herman Miller, Japan Airlines and Toyo Ito Architects in Japan, as well as a host of top design brands.  See some of Ross Lovegrove's designs. » . Away from his client work, one of Lovegrove's projects is the ""Car on a Stick,"" an electric bubble car that turns into an elevated streetlight at night. ""I'm interested in developing an aesthetic for the 21st century which comes from the intelligent use of resources, materials and structures,"" he says. Lovegrove's methods blend organic inspiration, a fresh approach to function, cutting-edge manufacturing technologies and cross-application of techniques. ""In my own work, I'll learn from doing a super-lightweight suitcase in Osaka,"" he says. ""Then I'll think, 'How can I use that super-lightweight technology to do the chassis of a car?'

37,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""No matter what I do in life I think I will always be remembered as the wrap dress"" -- (Diane von Furstenberg, CNN 2008) Calling the shots: Diane von Furstenberg oversees a meeting to discuss handbags in New York. Belgian-born, New York-living, ex-member of the German royal family, daughter of a holocaust survivor, socialite and business-woman, Diane von Furstenberg is famous for one thing: a single item of clothing. Her wrap dress -- a patterned piece of jersey tied around the body like a kimono -- sold in the millions. In the 70s, when Von Furstenberg launched her dress business, the wrap's simplicity became synonymous with feminism and the sexual revolution. ""I was selling clothes that would make other women feel confident,"" (Von Furstenberg, CNN, 2008). And the designer herself came to become the face of the brand. Photographed modeling her own clothes, launched a face that became so iconic that Andy Warhol painted her. But with success came boom then bust -- the 80s saw a dramatic nose-dive in the quality and distribution of the DVF brand. ""I became successful very quickly, a lot of people wanted my name and I licensed a lot of things .. the spirit of the brand disappeared"", (Von Furstenberg, CNN, 2008). In the late 90s, wrap dresses came back in to fashion, and DVF returned to the fashion pages, and subsequently fashion shows, of the age. The comeback is recorded as one of the most successful business stories of the decade. Her 30 stores and countless concessions in department stores make the DVF brand a multi-million dollar fashion empire. She dresses celebrities from Madonna to Sharon Stone, but keeps her products affordable and maintains an ethos of ""easy to wear"" ""When a woman goes in to a DVF shop and tries something on, it's like a light turns on"", (Von Furstenberg, CNN, 2008). Celebrities are often snapped wearing Von Furstenberg's designs. DVF often clings to Eva Longoria Parker's silhouette who declares to Revealed ""She is one of my favorite people -- not just a designer!"" Honored by the Council of Fashion of Designers of America (CFDA) by inviting Von Furstenberg to act as President -- she is now seen as the Grand Dame of New York fashion. CNN gains access to her as she prepares for the 2008 CFDA Awards -- deciding at the last moment to ditch one of her own designs and wear an Yves St Laurent tuxedo in a tribute to her friend, the designer who died a few days before the ceremony. Clearly moved, Revealed includes footage of her rehearsing the changes to her speech to include a touching farewell to YSL: ""He brought art into fashion, and fashion into art. He used to joke that he always wanted to be Matisse. But I think if we could have asked Matisse, he would have wanted to be Yves St Laurent"" she tells CNN. Revealed follows Diane von Furstenberg at an exciting moment in her catwalk history. For the first time she is showing outside of the United States, and the setting for her European debut is a romantic private Florentine garden, under the full moon. The Tuscan capital is a special place for her, as it was half an hour down the road that her first wrap dress was produced in a local textile factory.

38,"(CNN) -- They scream germs: Used gum. A flock of pigeons. A tomb covered with kisses. The Blarney Stone in Ireland received more than 400,000 visitors in 2008, many who kissed the lucky stone. These bacteria-infested attractions have topped an unusual list compiled by editors at TripAdvisor.com, a travel advice Web site. This summer, editors at the site named the five ""germiest"" tourist spots in the world. Despite the H1N1 scare that went global this spring, tourists haven't stopped spitting out their gum and sticking it onto a wall already saturated with millions of gooey pieces, editors say. Nor do germ fears stop travelers from journeying to the pigeon-infested St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy, where the birds often bestow droppings. ""These places are great attractions regardless of the fact that they are 'germy',"" said Brooke Ferencsik, a travel expert at TripAdvisor. ""Venice is lovely, and it's a great spot, but with all the pigeons, I'd bring an umbrella just in case the birds drop some gifts from above."" Though it is unlikely to get sick from visiting one of these places, health experts say germs are always a gamble. The more people who touch and visit a spot, the more germs there are in the mix, they say. Their traveling advice? Travelers should load up on hand sanitizers and wash their hands often on their trips. Blarney Stone in Blarney, Ireland . Where the Blarney Stone came from and how it got to Ireland is a matter of debate. One old tale goes: Once upon a time, the king of Ireland saved a woman drowning in Blarney Lake. The woman told the king that if he kissed the stone, he would receive the gift of eloquence. Thus, the tradition of kissing the Blarney stone was born.  Watch where you can find germ hotspots » . Last year, about 400,000 people kissed the stone, says a spokesman for Blarney Castle & Gardens. To do so, the person must be hung upside down to kiss the rock. Some people prefer watching to smooching. Chuck Gerba, a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona, visited the Blarney Stone in Ireland last year and refused to kiss the same spot where millions of tourists had put their lips. ""My wife did it,"" he added. ""And I wiped her lips before I kissed her."" Market Theater Gum Wall in Seattle, Washington . There is a distinct fruity aroma that welcomes visitors when they pass the giant wall of gum housing millions of chewed pieces in Seattle. The gum -- pink, blue, yellow and green -- is piled several inches thick, spanning an area 15 feet high and 50 feet wide.  Watch the wall of gum » . The Gum Wall, also dubbed the Wall of Gum, is one of the strangest attractions in Pike Place Market, where visitors can go to watch fish throwers and see the original Starbucks. ""People will do artwork with the gum,"" said Jay Hitt, the marketing director of the Market Theater. ""They write words on the wall, stick posters and business cards."" The gum-sticking tradition began by accident in 1993 when patrons, mostly college students waiting in line for a show, would stick gum to the wall. Theater company workers say they scraped the gum routinely, but eventually gave up. Slowly the gum amassed. Today, there aren't any rules at the Gum Wall. Visitors from all over the world snap photos next to it and leave as many pieces of their own gum as they want. St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy . In the heart of Venice, Italy, lies St. Mark's Square, also known as Piazza San Marco, where both tourists and pigeons flock. Each year, more than 2 million visitors venture to St. Mark's Square to see the Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica. Thousands of the dirty birds crowd the square sometimes leaving their droppings or attacking visitors. Some fearless visitors who aren't worried about germs snap pictures with the birds. But health experts warn that birds are notorious for carrying dangerous germs and viruses. If you want to see the famous pigeons, go soon. In 2007, city officials have worked hard to remove the pigeons from the square. They have banned people from feeding them and have even started trapping the birds in nets, significantly reducing the pigeon population. Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California . What do George Clooney, Clint Eastwood and Marilyn Monroe have in common? All three of them are celebrated stars with their hand prints molded into the concrete of the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre for millions of people to touch. The sidewalk is littered with 246 celebrity hand and footprints that draw in 4.5 million visitors a year, many of whom put their own hands and feet on them. The site began as an accident in 1927 when Norma Talmadge, a famous actress in the 1920s, stepped into wet cement. Creator and owner of the theater, Sid Grauman, decided to make the hand and footprints a tradition. ""The stars are selected based on the longevity of their career,"" said Levi Tinker, a tour guide at the Grauman Theatre. ""Stars who will be around 10 to 20 years from now are picked so people know who they are."" For germ-conscious travelers, Tinker says the concrete is mopped daily and pressure washed once a week. Oscar Wilde's Tomb in Paris, France . It's an unusual site in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Author and playwright Oscar Wilde's body rests in a tomb speckled with lipstick marks from visitors from all over the world showing their literary appreciation. Wilde, who died in 1900 from cerebral meningitis, continues to be a celebrated literary figure today famous for his tabooed sexuality at the time and his novels such as ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" The kisses display a rainbow of colors -- so much so that travel experts say Oscar Wilde's name on the tomb can be hard to discern sometimes. One TripAdvisor traveler wrote after visiting the grave, ""The tombstone of Oscar Wilde is ... well, wild, excuse the pun.""",0.58736396,5327

41,"(CNN) -- They were taken before Marilyn Monroe became branded as the voluptuous blonde who oozed sex appeal in dozens of Hollywood films. A 24-year-old Marilyn Monroe poses for Life magazine in August 1950. They were taken before rumors of an affair with President John F. Kennedy swirled and her mental breakdowns became public. They were taken before the beautiful actress's mysterious overdose that resulted in her death at the age of 36. In a collection discovered by Life.com last month, unpublished photographs of Monroe reveal a softer, more innocent 24-year-old budding starlet in a more peaceful time, before her fame peaked. Her flawless face bears a natural look with minimal makeup, unusual for the star, who was often glamorized in photo shoots with lipstick, designer dresses and expensive jewelry. Monday would have been Monroe's 83rd birthday. In one photo, the young Monroe lies in bliss, reading on a park bench, which editors at Life.com believe was shot at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. In another, her face is serene as she is perched over a bridge barefoot. The shoot, which dates to 1950, was conducted by Life photographer Ed Clark. It's a side of Monroe that the American public has rarely seen. ""She hasn't really exploded as a star, yet she was on the brink of something big,"" says Dawnie Walton, deputy editor at Life.com, a Web site harboring more than 7 million Life magazine photographs. The site was launched in March. ""I was amazed looking at her face. Although she looks very innocent, there is something very ... sexy."" Last month, Walton stumbled upon the rare photographs while combing through the company's digital photo archives. Apparently, no one at Life.com even knew they were ever taken. Upon investigating the photos, Walton says, she found there were few notes left on the negatives. She says the photos were probably taken for a cover shoot that was never used. Monroe appeared on her first Life magazine cover in 1952.  See some of the previously unpublished photos of Monroe » . ""It just got lost and stowed away,"" Walton said. ""It was just ... somewhere in a warehouse in New Jersey."" At the time the photos were shot, Monroe had her first small breakout role as a mistress in ""The Asphalt Jungle."" The star was better known as a model at the time, though she'd had a handful of cameos in films. Photographer Ed Clark told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune a friend from 20th Century Fox alerted him that the studio had just signed ""a hot tomato."" ""She was unknown then, so I was able to spend a lot of time shooting her,"" Clark said. ""We'd go out to Griffith Park and she'd read poetry. I sent several rolls to Life in New York, but they wired back, 'Who the hell is Marilyn Monroe?' "" Photographs later in the 1950s and early 1960s would display a much more confident and sexual Monroe -- images that would become iconic in popular culture. There is the famous photograph of a busty Monroe in a white halter dress, standing with her skirt blowing up in 1955 for her role in ""The Seven Year Itch."" In 1962, American photographer Bert Stern shot a tipsy, sometimes nude Monroe in a series of delicate shots that would be known as ""The Last Sitting."" Monroe died about six weeks later, on August 5, 1962. Life.com staff members say there are 15 million photographs in the Life archive dating back to the late 1850s, even before Life officially began publishing in 1936. Two years ago, the publication began slowly transferring the photographs into a digital archive. From time to time, unpublished photographs will be found that the company doesn't know existed. Other times, the photographs may have been taken but never selected to be used for publication. Last March, to commemorate the 11th anniversary of Frank Sinatra's death, Life.com released a series of unpublished photographs of the singer.

Lifetiles don't use electricity, moving parts or tricky lighting -- just an elaborate and painstaking process done out of Seder's Eye Think Inc. studio near Boston. ""What I'm after is trying to create an experience which totally takes you by surprise,"" he said. Scanimation on the shelf . If the technology you see in Lifetiles looks familiar, you might have caught something similar at a local bookstore. The popular children's books ""Gallop!"" and ""Swing!"" were also written and illustrated by Seder. With a technique he calls scanimation, pictures in the books come alive as you flip the page. It's a kids' favorite that quite a few parents enjoy, too, based on sales numbers. ""Swing!"" and ""Gallop!"" are currently on The New York Times bestseller list. Seder originally used scanimation in greeting cards he sold at trade shows around the country. Then Workman Publishing came calling, asking Seder to develop a book based on the eye-catching technique. That's when Seder caught lightning in a bottle. After several decades as a somewhat unknown artist, he found himself flying to China to teach the scanimation technique to book makers. Just a few years later, there are over 2 million copies of ""Gallop!"" in print in more than 13 languages. Still awed by their popularity, Seder said, ""I would've been satisfied if a limited edition sold well. It totally blew my mind what happened."" Although his books' success have gained Seder some newfound publicity, the Lifetiles are truly his life's work. The relatively unknown and seemingly modern form of art isn't new at all. Seder's been working on Lifetiles for more than 20 years, inspired by toys from the 1850s called zoetropes and an active imagination as a youngster. ""I started making movies when I was 12 years old,"" he said, ""so I was always into motion pictures and especially into optical tricks and techniques that trick the eye."" How does it work? As a viewer, you don't have to learn how to see a Lifetile. It's intuitive, and one immediately understands the concept. As you walk past the mural, it begins to move along with you. But the question that immediately comes to mind -- and the one Seder gets the most -- is, ""How does it work?"" ""The short answer is, it's magic,"" Seder said. ""The longer answer is, it's like a flipbook. I've taken all the pages from a flipbook and scrambled them all together, and I've put them up on the wall and made them animate."" The lengthy process also requires attention to detail. Much like an animator, he creates a series of drawings on his computer. He then strips down each image into what becomes an indistinguishable picture made up of a series of vertical lines. This squiggly-lined image becomes the equivalent of a photo negative. The negative gets sandblasted onto a hand-cast glass tile made in Seder's studio. The heavy, 8-inch-square glass tiles get painted, scraped, fired in a kiln and finally added piece by piece to a Lifetiles mural. Hundreds of these tiles work in harmony to create a huge moving image when displayed on a wall. Seder patented the painstaking technique but thinks most other artists wouldn't have his patience, even if they had his know-how. ""It's not that I've been playing my cards close to my vest,"" he said. ""It's just very difficult to do."" A Lifetiles installation, from conception to completion, can take up to a year to complete. It's a labor of love he shares with others who walk by his ""magic"" walls. ""I love to watch people react to the work. They don't expect a wall to move,"" he said. ""They'll be walking down the hallway in a museum and walking outdoors through a zoo ... and suddenly they realize, 'Those dolphins are starting to move next to me! How is that possible?'

She has earned the reputation for offering a stylish and high-quality product while at the same time inviting the consumer to experience the inspiration behind it. As a designer of clothing that ""suggests tolerance, global acumen, and a Fourth of July faith in individual expression,"" Tam, in the words of fashion critic and curator Richard Martin, possesses an ""idealistic globalism that transcends politics and offers a more enchanted, peaceful world."" Born in Canton, China, Vivienne Tam moved to Hong Kong when she was three years old. Her bi-cultural upbringing in the then British colony was the first stage in the development of her signature East-meets-West style. After graduating from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Vivienne Tam moved to New York where she thrived on the excitement and energy of the fashion world. New York became a home for her and a continuing source of stimulation for her designs. In 1994, Vivienne Tam launched her signature collection of Eastern inspired clothing with a modern edge on the New York runways. In 1995, she introduced the influential Mao collection that triumphantly crossed over from the fashion world into the art world. Then in 1997 Vivienne Tam launched the Buddha collection. The public and celebrities around the world quickly embraced both collections. Some of the images became so popular that scores of designers even adopted the look into their designs. Pieces of the collections were ultimately incorporated into the permanent archives of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, The Museum of FIT and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In an era where the fashion industry is populated by numerous names and emerging new talents, Vivienne Tam has shown that she can consistently appeal to everyone from high-society to urban to teens, offering them fresh collections every season.

45,"London, England (CNN) -- The fashion world was Friday mourning the death of celebrated British designer Alexander McQueen as questions were raised over the future of his multi-million dollar luxury clothing brand. A day after McQueen was found dead in his London home, the 40-year-old's flagship store in the city was closed, while flowers were laid in honor and a flag was flown at half mast over the shuttered doorway. A manager at the Alexander McQueen store in New York, where similar memorial scenes of flowers and candles were reported, said the shop would also be closed in light of the designer's death. McQueen's New York fans show support . Emerging from a modest background as the son of an east London taxi driver to become a household name, McQueen's success has been hailed as a testament to his talent, but analysts say there are doubts his name will endure. Design brands have previously outlived their founders, with notable examples being the success of Frenchman Yves Saint Laurent's empire despite his death in 2008, and the survival of Gianni Versace's label following his 1997 murder. Industry insiders say McQueen's hands-on involvement in his business as the creative driving force behind the label's bold and eccentric output will be difficult to sustain without the designer at the helm. Gucci Group, which acquired a 51 percent stake in the McQueen brand in 2001, has yet to make a statement on the future of the label and its 11 stores worldwide which, according to the Financial Times, was not profitable until 2007. The fashion house has not disclosed current figures for the brand which, the Times of London newspaper reported Gucci paid £13.6 million ($21.2 million) for its stake in. Tim Gadoffre, CEO of luxury brand analyst Marival & Company, said McQueen's death represented a ""disaster"" for the brand and said there would be substantial doubts over the label's ability to survive its visionary founder's death. Says Gadoffre, despite huge celebrity success, the McQueen brand had only just been consolidated as a going concern and the next decade would have been crucial in converting the designer's name into a long-term franchise. ""It is too early to tell, but I'm not convinced it is possible to project the business any further without him,"" he told CNN. Nevertheless, retailers were reporting a sharp rise in sales of  McQueen items in the immediate wake of his death. A spokeswoman for the upscale Liberty of London department store told CNN it had seen a 14-fold increase in McQueen brand sales, with top sellers including his signature skull print scarf and main line collection. McQueen's death reportedly occurred on the eve of the funeral of his mother, Joyce, with whom he was said to have a very close relationship . Tributes have poured in for McQueen, with many in the fashion and film industry hailing the ""enfant terrible"" for his diverse clothing creations and for dressing stars such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicole Kidman. ""His brilliant imagination knew no bounds as he conjured up collection after collection of extraordinary designs,"" said British Vogue Editor Alexandra Shulman, adding that his work ""influenced a whole generation of designers."" ""His death is the hugest loss to anyone who knew him and for very many who didn't,"" she said in a statement on the magazine's Web site. ""We are deeply shocked and saddened at the news of Alexander McQueen's untimely death,"" said a statement on the London Fashion Week Web site. ""He was a unique talent and one of the world's greatest designers. Our thoughts are with his friends and family at this sad time."" Although McQueen was not showing a collection at the London Fashion Week, he was to unveil his ready-to-wear collection at the Paris fashion shows in March. His 2010 spring/summer collection featured alien-inspired makeup and prints, according to Vogue, and ""was lauded as his best by the fashion press."" Dresses in that ready-to-wear line had exaggerated tiny waists and rounded hips, and models on the catwalk wore high club-like boots with them. Model Naomi Campbell said she was ""truly devastated"" by McQueen's death. ""His talent had no boundaries and he was an inspiration to everyone who worked with him and knew him,"" she said in a statement released by her publicist. Designer Carolina Herrera called McQueen ""one of a -kind"" and said in a statement that he was ""one of the most talented designers of his generation. This is a big loss for the world."" The designer was born as Lee Alexander McQueen in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver. He left school with few qualifications, but later studied fashion at London's prestigious St. Martin's College and worked on the famous Savile Row street of tailors at a company that made suits for Prince Charles. One anecdote that helped cement his bad-boy image claimed that he had once embroidered a suit for the Prince of Wales with a profanity sewn into the lining. His clothing line was purchased in 1991 by stylist Isabella Blow, who became a close friend.

46,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A stolen Statue of Liberty replica has resurfaced in a disturbing video posted on YouTube that shows someone decapitating the blindfolded lady and smashing her head into pieces. The YouTube video shows a gloved hand sawing off Lady Liberty's head before smashing it. The 200-pound replica was stolen less than a month ago from Vox Pop, a coffee shop in Brooklyn. ""It's very disturbing,"" shop operator Debi Ryan told CNN, adding the video struck a chord similar to that of terrorist assassination videos. ""I don't know what it means. ... I don't know who would do this."" The YouTube video begins with a waving American flag, and then shows a gloved hand sawing off the head of the statue before crushing it. The slogans ""We don't want your freedom"" and ""Death to America"" flash across the screen during the one-minute video, which is dated July Fourth. It was anonymously e-mailed to the Daily News and Ryan earlier this week. Ryan said she's sure the statue in the video is the one stolen from her cafe. ""She's unique. I know my girl,"" she said of the statue. ""We just had her completely refurbished, outfitted with a solar torch and painted."" Authorities told CNN they are handling the case as a larceny rather than separately investigating the YouTube video. ""We want to verify who sent the e-mail with the video and see if they're responsible,"" police said. A sign on the store, located in Ditmas Park, reads, ""Books, Coffee, Democracy,"" near where the 8-foot replica of Lady Liberty used to stand outside. The self-described community coffee shop is also a bookstore and a spot for artists and performers. ""We've created a space here that's owned by the community,"" Ryan said. ""We're all about freedom of speech and freedom to be who you are and say whatever you think."" But Ryan doesn't consider the YouTube video featuring her stolen statue appropriate free speech. ""Vox Pop stands for freedom of speech. You don't get to steal somebody else's property to send that message. We have to respect each other,"" she said. Although the coffee shop recently faced economic problems and neighborhood tension, the motive behind the statue's theft remains unknown. As for whether there will be a replacement statue, Ryan said, ""I'm hoping. I think she belongs here. But she added, ""Whether we have a physical statue or not, what she stands for remains here.""",0.57062656,5633

Gunther von Hagens' controversial ""Body Works"" shows have traveled throughout the world. Part of his traveling ""Body Works"" exhibition, ""The Cycle of Life,"" is showing at Berlin's Postbahnhof and features 200 human bodies at various life stages -- from conception to old age, including embryos and fetuses taken from historic anatomical collections. In one exhibit a male body is lying on his back with a woman sitting astride him with her back towards his head. Torsten Woehlert, spokesman for Berlin's Culture Ministry, told CNN that there has already been a number of complaints from the public in the press, though none have come to the ministry itself. He said: ""As it is not against the law, only against good taste, there is not much the government could do anyway."" Conceived by Gunther von Hagens -- dubbed Dr. Death in Germany -- the exhibition displays the bodies with their muscles, nerves and tendons on show using a preservation technique he pioneered called plastination. This process involves replacing all body fluids and soluble fat with specially manufactured plastics. On his Web site, the anatomist describes the exhibition's purpose and goal ""to reveal and expose the anatomical structure of the human body and its function, in a unique lesson, and to teach us about the complexity of the human body, its anatomy, and the importance of leading a healthy way of life."" What do you think? He added that the source of the exhibition is from donors -- people, who during their lifetime, declared their willingness, by informed consent, to display their bodies at the exhibition for the ""benefit of education, health and the awareness of the wide public to the different systems of the human body."" When asked about the coupling of sex and death, von Hagens told Germany's Bild that ""death and sex are both taboo topics. I'm bringing them together. Death belongs to life."" He added that ""without sex no life would exist."" Von Hagens' work has divided opinion in the past, with critics often doubting his scientific motives and accusing him of shocking people to gain publicity. His public autopsy in 2002 for British broadcaster Channel 4 -- the first in the UK for 170 years -- received hundreds of complaints. The authorities also threatened to arrest him after declaring the procedure illegal.

48,"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt is suspending ties with France's famous Louvre museum until the latter returns artifacts that it knew were stolen when it purchased them, the head of the country's antiquities council said Wednesday. Egypt accuses the Louvre museum of failing to make good on promises to return antiquities. Zahi Hawass, director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said he wrote a letter seven years ago to major museums around the world asking them to consult with Egyptian authorities before buying any ancient Egyptian artifacts from outside sellers. Hawass said the Louvre had bought five murals chipped off the walls from a tomb in Thebes and been stolen by antiquities robbers in the 1980s. He sent a letter to the Louvre a year ago asking that the stolen paintings be returned, he said. The museum promised to return the items but has not followed through, he said. Until it does so, Egypt will suspend its cooperation with the Louvre, Hawass said. A Louvre spokesman declined to comment on Egypt's claims. Egypt maintains antiquities exchange programs with museums around the world. The Louvre is one of the biggest repositories of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world, much of it treasure taken during the time of the French and British occupation of the country. Egypt's position is that artifacts taken by European powers during that period are a fait accompli, but anything taken illegally since Egypt's independence must be returned. This has been one of the major emphases of Hawass since he became head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in 2002. Egypt took similar steps against museums in England and Belgium in the past. Those ties were restored after the artifacts in question were returned, Hawass said.",0.5620454,8455
49,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- They've been teasing and tantalizing female readers with images of muscular men oozing sensuality and the pretty women they are destined to save and then fall in love with. The ""beefcakes and bodices"" book covers have helped Harlequin sell their romance novels for more than half a century. Powerful men and demure women were stock in trade in early Harlequin novels. ""It's always great to feel like you're the girl in the book and the handsome guy is coming to rescue you,"" said Liz Lenz, 25, who has been reading Harlequin novels since she was a teen. ""It's always fun for the reader."" Those covers also seduced Winnipeg, Canada, teacher Louann Bergen. ""There's usually good-looking males on the covers or something intriguing to make you want to read more,"" she said. ""I guess they change with the times, but they still have that same allure and that same passion behind them."" As sort of a 60th anniversary gift to its faithful readers, Harlequin is displaying original artwork for its covers in an New York exhibit called ""The Heart of a Woman: Harlequin Cover Art 1949-2009."" And before you sniff disdainfully at romance novel art, be reminded: That artwork sells a lot of books. Romance fiction is responsible for $1.375 billion in book sales every year, according to Romance Writers of America. The organization says more than a quarter of all books sold are romance novels, satisfying 51 million readers every year. The Harlequin exhibit comes from boxes and boxes of old novels that employees discovered at the company's headquarters in Toronto, Canada. ""I pawed through literally thousands of paintings,"" curator Elizabeth Semmelhack said, adding that she saw apparent shifts in women's historical desires began to emerge.  Watch the curator discuss some favorites » . ""Rather than being retardataire [outdated], many of these images are extremely cutting edge,"" she said. ""There are images of women doctors before women were really embraced by the workplace. There are women who are adventuring around the world before independence is really part of women's culture."" Many early Harlequin covers, like that of Elizabeth Houghton's ""Island Hospital,"" in which a man, woman and grizzly bear stand poised in confrontation, depict more than one (fully clothed) character in the crux of a suspenseful moment. ""You don't know, is the couple going to get together? Is the hero going to save the heroine? The happy ending is not on the cover,"" Semmelhack explained. The illustrations have changed their tone over the years. Where cover art used to hint at psychological intrigue, it's grown to instead promise a passionate physical conclusion. ""From the earliest covers, there's sort of an implied sexual tension, but there isn't much direct imaging of passion. That doesn't happen until the late '70s and into the '80s,"" she said. ""By the time you hit the sexual revolution and passion becomes of primary importance on these covers, then that lover's embrace in many ways signals the happy ending right there on the front of the book."" And in recent decades, the once revolutionary depictions of the lovers' raw embrace have been reduced further. ""Today, covers might just be the undressed male body. He might even be headless. He's so truncated that all you're doing is looking at the object of desire, his masculinity."" Although Harlequin romances are predominantly written for and read by women, according to Semmelhack, the majority of the publisher's cover illustration artists have been male. ""It is interesting that you have men imaging female desire,"" she said. ""It seems to work; the books certainly sell."" This year, Harlequin books, which publishes 1,200 new titles annually, reported first quarter earnings up more than 13 percent. Debbie Macomber, who has published 153 books since 1983 -- and is most recently author of a May New York Times Harlequin best-seller, ""Summer on Blossom Street."" -- visited the ""Heart of a Woman"" exhibit on opening night. ""There were some that really made me laugh out loud,"" Macomber said. ""It was amazing to see the role and the progression of the women's movement in the cover art itself. I get letters from 13-year-old girls and women who are in their 90s, and that's one of my goals as a writer: to write books that are relevant to my readers.""",0.55897486,4218
50,"(CNN) -- The wooden sculptures lining the median of U.S. 90 are among the top tourist attractions on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Marlin Miller's live oak sculpture in Biloxi's Town Green will be dedicated Saturday. They are also a creative tribute to the live oaks that lined the scenic highway before the saltwater surge of Hurricane Katrina killed them at their very roots. After the storm, the Mississippi Department of Transportation began bulldozing the dead trees, much to the chagrin of area residents. Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway, one of the coast's longtime civic leaders, intervened. He contracted to have some of the live oak trunks turned into sculptures. But it would have proved to be a costly venture. Enter Marlin Miller, a wood sculptor from Fort Walton Beach, Florida, who volunteered to create a few live oak sculptures for free -- in part to leave his artistic mark on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, but also as a service to the community. A tree sculpture begins with the transportation department removing all the branches, leaving just the core of the tree. ""I get an idea of what that carving is going to look like, and I go after it with a wide variety of steel chain saws."" Miller said. He works his way down to high speed grinders, sanders and chisels to add the final detail work. ""They're live oaks, so it's like carving stone. Sparks fly off my chain saw blades when I go after one of the trees,"" Miller said. Some of the trees, which are as much a part of south Mississippi's heritage as the antebellum homes scattered along the coastline, are estimated to be as much as 500 or 600 years old. Miller's sculptures along U.S. 90 range from eagles and herons to seahorses and dolphins. He said local governments have never dictated how his carvings should look. In Pass Christian, Miller created what he believes to be the world's largest eagle wood carving, at 25 feet tall. ""That sculpture is dedicated to Col. Lawrence Roberts, one of the original Tuskegee Airmen,"" he said. A recent survey of area tourist attractions by the Harrison County Tourism Commission listed the beaches as the third-most popular attraction and the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino second. Miller's tree sculptures are first. ""We've had a lot of traffic diverting off of Interstate 10, down to U.S. 90 just to see these carvings,"" Miller said. On Saturday, one of Miller's sculptures will be dedicated on the Biloxi Town Green: a 24-foot-tall marlin flying into the sky, three mahi fish jumping to the left, and a sea turtle and a blue crab at the base. It is the only painted tree sculpture of all those lining U.S. 90. Next on Marlin's to-do list: an oak tree in the center of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and one in Gulfport, Mississippi. He also plans to expand the project to downtown New Orleans and parts of North Carolina. ""Instead of just cutting these trees down,"" Marlin said, ""we're going to put new life into them by adding a sculpture.""",0.5578508,8724

The Times commissioned Portuguese photographer Edgar Martins to shoot a Sunday magazine color photo essay titled ""Ruins of the Second Gilded Age"" to capture physical evidence of the real estate bust that took place across the United States. In the text that preceded the six photos that were published, the magazine stated that while the photographer ""creates images with long exposures,"" he does so without digital manipulation.

His grandfather, Allen Parrish, was a Pullman Porter and helped inspire some of his train paintings. Robert West paints his latest project in his Atlanta, Georgia,  studio. ""When I was growing up, we would often take grandfather to work at the train station. I became impressed and mesmerized with trains through this experience. This passion ultimately led me to become a full-time railroad illustrator,"" West said. The Pullman Company was one of the largest employers of African-Americans in the 1920s and '30s. It hired them as porters in railroad sleeping cars to assist railroad passengers and make up beds. These jobs were once highly regarded in the black community because they offered the opportunity to travel and better pay and security than most jobs open to blacks at the time. West says trains have an important place in African-American history -- from symbolism in Negro spirituals to a real conveyance for the mass migration of blacks moving to the North in the 1930s, '40s and '50s. ""Trains have so long symbolized hope, freedom and power -- what better metaphor could there be to represent our struggle and our assimilation into mainstream American life,"" West said.

54,"(CNN) -- Flamboyant and fearless, Roberto Cavalli is the peacock of the fashion world; with his body-hugging clothes, he woos women the world over. Fashion designer Roberto Cavalli . But his clients are no dainty damsels: Cavalli's women are Amazonian warriors and Grecian goddesses, whose armor is fashion and whose weapon is sex. His colorful creations are unabashed celebrations of the female form: dresses slashed to the hip or barely skimming the buttocks, necklines that plunge where no other designer dares. Cavalli's woman knows she looks fabulous, and isn't afraid to show it: to her, it's not just clothing, it's an announcement that she's arrived. Born in Florence in 1940, Cavalli was immersed in an intensely creative environment from childhood. That influence came from his father, a tailor, and his artist grandfather, Giuseppe Rossi, whose work is shown in the famous Uffizi Galleries. Following in his father's footsteps, Cavalli studied textile design at the local art institute. By the early 70s, he had developed an innovative technique for printing on lightweight leather, and his Florentine flair had led to commissions with Hermes and Pierre Cardin. In 1970, he presented his first namesake collection at the Salon for Prêt-à-Porter in Paris. His trademark work with unconventional fabrics like embellished denim and leather, mixed with wild animal prints and exotic patterns, was embraced by the jet set and Cavalli opened his first boutique in Saint Tropez in 1972. Cavalli married his wife, Eva Duringer, a former Miss Universe, in 1980; she is now his business partner and right-hand woman. His fondness for bright color, exotics, fur and bold prints -- which he designs in his factory on the outskirts of Florence -- have won him a name as the king of fashion excess. Beloved by A-listers and pop princesses, these are not clothes for the shy: this is old-school glamour, infused with power, wielded by women who have flounced and shimmied their way to the top.  See Cavalli's designs on the catwalk » . His main line is sold in over 50 countries worldwide, along with his diffusion lines RC Menswear and Just Cavalli, plus a children's line, knitwear, accessories, eyewear, watches, perfumes, underwear and beachwear. He's even ventured into Cavalli-branded vodka and wine. His collaboration with high-street fashion store H&M in November 2007 caused stampedes as his fans flocked to get their hands on his creations, desperate to capture some of that Cavalli magic at tiny prices. Some have asked whether his latest collections have taken a more gentle direction -- but the tiger's inner fire still burns bright.

57,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A rare and original manuscript of one of America's most patriotic songs has been discovered in a flea market bargain. The manuscript of the song could be worth tens of thousands of dollars. A shopper browsing through the market in New York bought a framed picture of a flower for $10 and found handwritten manuscript of ""America"" (My Country 'tis of Thee) tucked behind the picture, the manuscript's owner said Thursday. The manuscript of the song whose lyrics were written by Samuel Francis Smith in 1831 could be worth tens of thousands of dollars, said the owner, art collector Keya Morgan. He said he bought it from the flea market shopper, who has asked not to be identified. The song was intended to be played in schools to inspire and teach children and was first played in public on July 4, 1831, in the First Baptist Church in Newton, Massachusetts, Morgan said.

59,"(CNN) -- For most people, Post-it Notes are disposable, ordinary office papers used for note-taking and reminders. But for 19-year-old David Alvarez of Leavenworth, Washington, they were the perfect medium for a 10-foot-tall mosaic depicting Ray Charles. David Alvarez, right, made this 10-foot-tall mosaic of Ray Charles using Post-it Notes. Using more than 2,000 of those ubiquitous brightly-colored sticky scraps, Alvarez composed a three-dimensional representation of the famous musician. The piece has just gone on display at Wenatchee Valley College in Wenatchee, Washington, where Alvarez is in his second year of studies.   ""It's something so simple. You can still see the flaps sticking out on some of them,"" he said. ""Naturally the Post-it Note just sort of flaps out.""   While learning new techniques in Adobe Photoshop in a class, he experimented with taking a photograph of Ray Charles and making it look like a mosaic on the computer screen. He then translated this idea into the Post-it work.  He spent three months constructing the mosaic, sometimes sacrificing schoolwork for his art. At least one of his papers for his summer English courses suffered, but he persevered so that he could participate in an art show July 28 at the Stanley Civic Center in Wenatchee.   Originally, the Post-it Notes stayed in this unique format only by virtue of their manufactured stickiness, which does not hold up as well as glue, Alvarez found. When he displayed his work at the show, he monitored the project for 14 hours, continuously replacing notes that were falling off.  The aspiring art teacher now uses glue to hold the notes in place. For his next project, he is considering a mosaic using 4-inch x 4-inch notes, up from the 3-inch x 3-inch size used in the Ray Charles piece.   ""Part of me wants to, part of me doesn't,"" he said.

61,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history. The letters cover Benjamin Franklin's success in dealing with a British general. The collection of 47 letters are hand-written copies made 250 years ago, when Franklin lived in London. That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held. The find is reported in the April issue of the William & Mary Quarterly, a journal of early American history and culture. The letters are important in large part because they offer a ""wealth of new details"" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007. They also raise the question of how many other documents remain waiting to be found on Franklin and his life. Houston, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to London, just before the library's closing time. ""The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'"" Houston told CNN. ""I've read everything Franklin ever wrote."" Houston said he quickly began to realize he had uncovered something previously unknown to historians. ""I swear, I just about shot through the ceiling I was so excited,"" he said. ""It's like finding a treasure chest."" Houston had been working at the time on a book on Franklin, ""Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement,"" published last year. The letters cover Franklin's success in dealing with British Gen. Edward Braddock, who had been sent to Pennsylvania in 1755 to defeat the French at Fort Duquesne, in modern-day Pittsburgh. The march to retake the fort was part of the French and British battle for control of the western lands in the colonies, part of a larger struggle for control of North America, Houston said. The problem was that Braddock was given no horses or wagons when he arrived in America -- no means of transport for him and his 2,000 redcoats. Braddock started to blame his hosts, so Franklin -- the Pennsylvania assembly's leading politician -- stepped in to help. Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men. It wasn't easy, because the farmers were tough negotiators who were also anxious and suspicious of the effort. Eventually, Franklin managed to get the farmers to agree, and within weeks, Braddock and his men were on the march. Braddock suffered a devastating defeat before he even reached the fort, however, when a much smaller contingent of French and Indian soldiers surprised the British. They killed Braddock and about 1,000 of his men. Despite the defeat, Franklin's success -- in what became known as ""the wagon affair"" -- highlighted his skill as a colonial leader, Houston said. When Franklin was sent to London in 1757 as a representative of the assembly, he brought with him a collection of letters detailing that success. It was proof of his political value to Great Britain and that the assembly's loyalties had been on the right side. This collection of letters, which Franklin referred to in his autobiography as his ""quire book,"" was never found, however -- until now. Houston said he believes the documents he read at the British Library are copies of that collection. They were made by Thomas Birch, an industrious and obsessive transcriber of historical documents who copied anything he could get his hands on. ""There was a vogue. It was very common for letters to be copied,"" said Matthew Shaw, curator of the U.S. collections at the British Library. ""Birch was very well known for being a copyist."" Birch and Franklin were friends in London, both members of the Royal Society, and Houston said he believes the copies were made sometime between 1757 and 1758. ""Birch undoubtedly found Franklin's quire book captivating, and he appears to have copied anything that remotely interested him,"" Houston writes in the journal. Also, Braddock's campaign and defeat were widely discussed in London, and ""Birch may have wanted to capture a crucial moment in the life of the (Royal) society's most famous American member."" Birch's transcripts were filed in the British Library as ""Copies of Letters relating to the March of General Braddock."" They form part of the massive Birch Collection containing the hundreds of volumes of his copies that Birch bequeathed to the library on his death, said Shaw. They weren't properly catalogued until the early 1970s, Shaw said, which is largely why they haven't been used by scholars. ""It's the first time they've really been shared with a wider audience,"" Shaw told CNN. ""We're very pleased.""",0.5275544,3257
62,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An expert on Lincoln photography thinks a photograph found in Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's family-owned album showing President Abraham Lincoln in front of the White House could be one of the last photos taken of the 16th president before he was assassinated in 1865. A photo found in Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's family album is verified to contain an image of Abraham Lincoln. Grant's great-great grandson Ulysses S. Grant VI had seen the previously unpublished image in the general's personal photo album, but didn't think much of it until he scrutinized it earlier this year. ""I started to think that it might be the White House,"" said Grant, a construction business owner from Springfield, Missouri. ""Then I started to look at the height difference between the people in the photo."" Thinking that the towering individual commanding the attention of the other people in the image could be Lincoln -- who stood 6-foot-4 and is the nation's tallest president -- Grant called Keya Morgan, a renowned collector and scholar of Lincoln and Gen. Grant photographs, to see whether his suspicions could be verified. Morgan, who owns the world's largest collection of Lincoln artifacts and original photographs, persuaded Grant to take the small photo out of the album to see whether any clues could be found on the back -- particularly the name of the photographer. ""If you don't know who the photographer is, it's like not knowing who your father and mother are,"" Morgan said. Sure enough, the seal of photographer Henry F. Warren appeared on the back, along with an inscription: ""Lincoln in front of the White House,"" dated 1865. Grant recognized the handwriting as that of his great-grandfather and Gen. Grant's youngest son, Jesse Grant. Those indicators, along with a revenue stamp used from 1864-66 to raise money during the Civil War, helped convince Morgan that the photograph could be the well-documented missing photo from Lincoln's last ""sitting.""  Watch how photograph was verified » . According to Morgan -- who cites Lincoln's secretaries John Hay and John Nicolay -- Warren took the last three photographs of Lincoln on March 6, 1865, just two days after his second inauguration. Morgan says Warren was desperate to take pictures of Lincoln, so he staged the first act of paparazzi photography. According to Morgan, Warren first took photos of the president's son Tad on his pony. The following day, Warren gave the pictures to Tad and told him to summon his father. Morgan says that Warren was already set up to take the photo outside the White House, and that Lincoln gave him access afterward to take two more portraits on the White House balcony. Will Stapp, founding curator of the National Portrait Gallery's photography department and a professional photograph appraiser, agrees with Morgan's assessment of the long-lost image. ""The figure itself, the physique -- in looking at it under a magnifying glass, I can see the shape of his beard; I can see the hairline,"" Stapp told CNN. ""It's similar to the impression you get from other photos taken of [Lincoln] from the same distance, like at the Gettysburg Address and his inauguration."" Stapp and Morgan also say it appears that Lincoln is wearing the same clothes in the outdoor photo as he wore for the portraits taken the same day. As one of only 130 photographs of Lincoln, it is an extraordinary find not only because of its proximity to Lincoln's death, but because it shows him in a natural stance. ""You could put yourself in the shoes of the people around [Lincoln] and see what it was like to live at the White House,"" said Morgan, who says he receives 10 to 20 requests a day asking him to verify potential Lincoln photographs. Morgan, who purchased the photo from Grant, says he has received thousands of e-mails from Lincoln aficionados commenting on the find. His Web site, lincolnimages.com, received more than 5 million hits on Tuesday and crashed because of the traffic overload.",0.5267998,1959
63,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an Irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of William Shakespeare created during his lifetime. The portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the ""only"" portrait painted during his lifetime. The image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Wells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old. ""A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,"" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616. The Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard. The most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes. The identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait. The portrait ""shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,"" Wells said. ""It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,"" Wells said. ""There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life."" Wells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face. ""I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,"" he said. ""It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'"" It should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king. The public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23. The portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.",0.5153906,2536
65,"(CNN) -- For five generations, the Meserve/Kunhardt family has been the collector and custodian of some of the most valuable photographs and memorabilia of Abraham Lincoln. Peter W. Kunhardt, left, Philip B. Kunhardt III and Peter W. Kunhardt Jr. co-authored ""Looking for Lincoln."" In fact, eminent Lincoln historian Harold Holzer said there's only one other family that's contributed more ""to our understanding of America's most enduring leader,"" and that's the Lincolns themselves. ""The Kunhardts -- and before them, their ancestor Frederick Hill Meserve -- have been active, and crucial for generations, in preserving Lincoln's image for posterity,"" Holzer said. ""Mr. Meserve literally saved photos from destruction, then cataloged and analyzed them. Later members of the family wrote seminal books incorporating the family-owned archive into the stories of Lincoln's life and death."" The family collection was the basis for the new book, ""Looking for Lincoln"" (Knopf), and for a PBS documentary. One of the book's co-authors, 26-year-old Peter W. Kunhardt Jr., has now joined the family business as assistant director of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation. Kunhardt, who recently earned a master's degree in art business and photography, also works on the Gordon Parks Foundation, a division of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation, which includes the life's work of the pioneering African-American photographer. Kunhardt spoke with CNN in an interview and follow-up conversations about the extraordinary family history. CNN: Tell us about your family. Peter W. Kunhardt Jr: I'm the fifth generation to be working on Lincoln. My great-great-grandfather was a man by the name of Frederick Hill Meserve. His father, William Neal Meserve, was a soldier in the Civil War who was wounded at the battle of Antietam, and he kept a diary of the entire time he was in war. That diary was illustrated by his son, Frederick Hill Meserve, years after the war through collecting photography. He became one of the leading collectors of 19th-century American photography. ... At that time photography was still quite new. In the late 19th century, the war-weary nation lost its interest in the images of that era. Many glass negatives were thought to be worthless. The emulsion was washed off, and many were used to build greenhouses. Meserve wrote a book in 1911 called ""Photographs of Abraham Lincoln."" He became obsessed with Lincoln. Lincoln was the first president to be photographed while in office. Meserve's goal in life was to find and catalog all the existing images of Lincoln, of which we now know there were about 120. Each photograph in Meserve's book, which he updated for the next half century, was given an ""M"" number. Part of our work was to update his numbering system and establish a new national standard. Then his daughter Dorothy Meserve Kunhardt, she became heavily involved with Lincoln scholarship and the collection as well. She was the author of the children's book, ""Pat the Bunny,"" which ... as everyone knows today, it's one of the most popular children's books. She worked with her father on Lincoln publications and continued to collect Lincoln. The collection was passed to Philip Kunhardt Jr., my grandfather, who eventually passed this collection of photographs on to my father and uncle, who were my co-authors in this book, ""Looking for Lincoln."" My grandfather, father and uncle wrote a book on Lincoln in 1992 called ""Lincoln: An Illustrated Biography,"" using the contents of the collection. Each generation has continued the fascination with the collection but with a special interest in Abraham Lincoln. CNN: What's your involvement now in the collection? Kunhardt: My role is the assistant director of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation. The foundation was established in 2002 by my father and uncle in order to preserve our family's collection and make it available to the public. During the past century, the collection had grown so large that we decided it was finally time to place it in public hands. That is why we first formed the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation. And this year the collection will be moved to the Neuberger Museum of Art at the State University of New York in Purchase, New York, and the Purchase Library at SUNY, where it will be made available to students and scholars. CNN: Was there ever any doubt in your mind that you wanted to go into this field? Kunhardt: I was an art history major at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. I've always been fascinated with our collection. I was flattered to be asked to help with this project, the Lincoln book. I've been an intern since I was about in fifth grade. I've grown up knowing this collection very well, putting everything in plastic sleeves. Then when we found out that they weren't of archival quality, I had to change them to polyester sleeves. It's really been a family love. We've all grown up with this collection. A great portion of this collection is now housed at the National Portrait Gallery. It was sold after my great-grandmother's death. CNN: What are some of the most valuable parts of the collection? Kunhardt: It includes many gems, like Alexander Gardner's oversized portrait of Lincoln that was taken just before he went to Gettysburg. As a young boy, I remember it hanging on the walls of our home. We also own the bronze life mask of Lincoln cast by Leonard Volk. CNN: Was Lincoln particularly interested in being photographed? Kunhardt: It was his way of reaching out to a wider audience. It was a process that was so slow, he had to sit for long periods of time with a neck brace in order to be photographed because the exposure time was forever. There are pictures where if he moved just slightly, the picture was blurry. Crowd scenes are always blurry because you couldn't make the crowd stay still. CNN: What's the story of the Gordon Parks Foundation? Kunhardt: My grandfather Philip Kunhardt was managing editor of Life magazine. He and Gordon became close personal friends, and shortly before both of them died in 2006, my grandfather showed Gordon how we were preserving our 19th-century collection. After Gordon's death, his estate placed all of his photographs with us, and we formed the Gordon Parks Foundation. CNN: What else are you working on? Kunhardt: Our next book is ""Lincoln Life Size,"" which will be published in September 2009. We're taking the Lincoln photographs and blowing them up to the actual size of Lincoln's face ... and it will include his own reactions to some of the photographs.",0.5076276,1722
66,"(CNN) -- An apartment left untouched since before the fall of the Berlin Wall has been discovered by a developer in the eastern German city of Leipzig, German media reports said Thursday.
