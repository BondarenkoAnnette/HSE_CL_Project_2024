0,"(CNN) -- The Amazon rainforest is so vast and full of life that even its defenders don't know exactly what it is they are protecting. In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest has been wiped out. ""The wealth of biodiversity is so immense, we cannot even estimate the amount we don't know,"" says Cláudio C. Maretti, Brazil-based director for conservation for the World Wildlife Fund. ""Every new expedition you do to the Amazon, you might find one new species of fish. Every other, you might find some new bird or frog."" The Amazon rainforest, which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental United States and stretches across nine countries, is considered the world's richest and most varied natural habitat, with several million species of insects, plants, birds and fish calling it home. It also plays an important role in regulating Earth's temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air. But the Amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades. In the past 40 years, roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out. Maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees. ""We have been deforesting at enormous rates,"" Maretti says. The chief drivers of this deforestation are large-scale business interests involved in logging, mining, agriculture and, especially, cattle ranching. Some of this activity is sanctioned by the government; much of it is not. Greenpeace estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal. The Amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest -- more than three times the size of Switzerland -- are lost each year because of clearing and degradation. The threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. Cambodia, for example, lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005, according to FAO. Vietnam lost close to 55 percent of its primary forests, FAO found. And Nigeria lost nearly 56 percent of its primary forests over the same period, the worst rate of forest loss in the world, according to FAO. The destruction of the Earth's oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon, but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades. ""Worldwide, one-half of all forests we've lost in the last 10,000 years has occurred in the last 80 years. Half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years,"" says Scott Paul, Forest Campaign Coordinator for Greenpeace. Paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market, not to meet local needs. ""The timber market, and also for agriculture, mining: When it plugs into the international economic system, that's when you've got to watch it,"" he says. Paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product they're consuming was harvested. ""If you buy wine and cheese, we can tell the region and the year. But forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side. There is no way to determine if something came from a well-managed forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery, murder, drug trade, etc.,"" he says. While the story of the world's old-growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction, forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas, such as the northeast region of the United States and parts of Europe. This thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species. ""Northern New England is the only place in the eastern United States where you have the potential for large-scale wilderness where wolves, lynxes, cougars, woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored,"" according to Michael J. Kellett, executive director of RESTORE: The North Woods. ""We could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the Maine woods as it once was."" With large-scale agriculture all but gone from New England and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere, Kellett's biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of Maine. His proposed solution: create a national park. In Brazil in recent years, the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the Amazon's destruction. Last October, Brazil said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws. Environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of Brazil's currency against the dollar, making the country's exports more expensive. The World Wildlife Fund's Maretti is hopeful that Brazil, with international help, will be able to protect even more of the Amazon, an area he considers among the most vital natural habitats in the world. ""We do have strong civil society. We do have more governance,"" Maretti says. ""But we certainly need support from abroad. I don't believe Brazil can do this job alone.""

1,"(CNN) -- Scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change. Glaciers in the European Alps may melt as soon as 2050, some scientists say. Some of the changes are already taking place. Others are expected to be seen in coming decades. There are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss. For those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of ""The Rough Guide to Climate Change"" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Here are Henson's top five choices: . Great Barrier Reef, Australia . Warming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays. Many of the world's reefs already are experiencing ""bleaching"" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons. The Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades. Henson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed. ""It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,"" he said. ""It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life."" Boats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close. New Orleans, Louisiana . How much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic. ""Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,"" Henson said. But for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term. ""In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,"" he said. Henson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent. ""It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,"" he said. ""You're standing below the level of the river, looking up."" Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado . Herds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees. Cold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped. The beetle infestation ""has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,"" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park. The beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape. Some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way, Henson said, but visitors should note that the color isn't natural for pine trees. ""Come soon. It's happening quickly,"" he said. Visit in the summer or early fall and take a breathtaking drive to 12,183 feet, Patterson said. Or, come in the winter and enjoy snowshoeing and nearby skiing. Many of the park's 355 miles of hiking trails are open year-round. Alpine Glaciers, Switzerland . The European Alps sit at a lower altitude than the Rocky Mountains, and their glaciers and ski resorts are therefore more susceptible to melting, Henson said. A climate expert in Austria recently told National Geographic that the Alps' famed glaciers will disappear entirely between 2030 and 2050. A 2006 report had said they would melt by the end of the century. Henson said he once took a train through the Alpine glaciers. They're worth seeing before they go -- whenever that happens, he said. ""They're beautiful; the light blue quality of the meltwater is really stunning,"" he said. Amazon rain forest, Brazil . Deforestation continues to be the major environmental issue in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest. But as locals and corporations chop down the Amazon's rich forests to create farmland and to harvest biofuels, climate change may make things worse. ""The fear is that there will be kind of a feedback where trees are cut down, and it gets warmer and drier"" in the forest until it can't grow back, Henson said. The best way to visit the forest is by boat, Henson said. That way, you'll leave less of a mark on the struggling ecosystem. Of course, getting to a boat on the Amazon is not simple, and the long trip can create a lot of heat-trapping pollution. Henson said the destination might be one of those better left alone by tourists.",0.7376474,2551
2,"(CNN) -- Forests in the Pacific Northwest are dying twice as fast as they were 17 years ago, and scientists blame warming temperatures for the trend, according to a new study. This photo of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado shows dying pines and firs among healthy trees. The study, to be released Friday in the journal Science, is the first large-scale analysis of environmental changes as contributing factors in the mortality of coniferous forests. The data for this research was gathered by generations of scientists over a 50-year period at multiple sites in Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and southwestern British Columbia. Seventy-six forest plots, all more than 200 years old, were monitored by scientists doing some of the most rudimentary research -- counting trees. ""It's not a happy story, but, an important one,"" said Phillip van Mantgem, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and the lead author of the study. ""These are beautiful places. They do change and respond to their environment, sometimes quickly."" ""If in your hometown where you live, the death rates of your friends and neighbors doubled and there are no compensating birth rates, wouldn't you want to figure out what's going on?"" said Nathan Stephenson, research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and one of the authors of the report. The study primarily focused on three types of coniferous trees: pines, firs and hemlocks. Older-growth forests -- some up to 500 years old -- have trees of all ages, and researchers found that mortality rates have increased for all age groups. Since mortality rates went up across the board, scientists ruled out a number of other possible causes, including ozone-related air pollution, long-term effects of fire suppression and normal forest dynamics. In the end, California had the highest tree death rate. Of the three types of coniferous trees studied, pines were found to be dying at the fastest rate. Ultimately, higher tree mortality may lead to significant shifts in forest structure and function, the report states. ""Much of the world's population in North America, Europe, most of China and large portions of Russia live near temperate forests, so what happens in these forests has global importance,"" said Jerry Franklin, a professor of forest resources at the University of Washington whose work was instrumental in maintaining the research plots. ""My guess is that forest loss has the potential to greatly exceed forest establishment,"" he added. The new findings concern scientists who see the study as further confirmation of the harmful effects of climate change on ecosystems. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific intergovernmental body, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now at their highest levels for at least 650,000 years. Scientists on the panel say the increase began with the birth of the Industrial Revolution 250 years ago. The new research also suggests that as trees die, they actually emit more carbon than they absorb. Trees are key players in regulating climate because they convert carbon dioxide, which they store in their trunks and roots, to oxygen. Changes in climatic conditions or various diseases can cause the gradual dying of plant shoots. ""The concern here is that these might be early warning signs of dieback,"" said Stephenson. Some scientists say that tree species unable to tolerate warmer conditions might just re-establish themselves in cooler areas. Given the speed at which warming appears to be occurring, it's not clear whether tree species will be able to migrate fast enough to survive, said van Mantgem of the U.S. Geological Survey. ""Warmer temperatures cause earlier summer droughts, less snow pack, and cause ideal breeding grounds for invasive species and pathogens,"" he added. ""One hypothesis is that warmer climates can make it easier for invasive species to reproduce and grow in these temperate forests. If the trees are already under a lot of environmental stress, they are more prone to serious insect attack,"" he said. Scientists say forests in the Western U.S. have been increasingly damaged in recent years by invasive insect species such as the bark beetle -- a sign that rising temperatures are having an adverse effect. Bark beetles are known to attack trees already weakened by other environmental factors. ""Many of these beetles cannot survive in cold temperatures, and it's getting warmer,"" said Tim Barnett, a ­research marine physicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Barnett authored a research paper linking drought conditions in the American West to increased human activity. ""It is perfectly reasonable to assume that this problem is going to get worse, not better,"" he said.",0.7282877,2197
3,"(CNN) -- A rat believed to be extinct for 11 million years, a spider with a foot-long legspan, and a hot pink cyanide-producing ""dragon millipede"" are among the thousand newly discovered species in the largely unexplored Mekong Delta region. The ""dragon millipede"" is among the 1,068 new species discovered in the Mekong Delta region. The region, including parts of Vietnam and five other countries, is home to 1,068 species found between 1997 and 2007, according to a World Wildlife Fund report released this week. Some of the creatures were not lurking in fertile floodplains or tropical foliage. A scientist visiting an outdoor restaurant was startled to see a Laotian rock rat among the nearby wildlife. The hairy, nocturnal, thick-tailed rat, which resembles a squirrel, had been thought for centuries to be extinct. ""There is a certain amount of shock because our scientists will sometimes see something that doesn't fit anything they know,"" said Dekila Chungyalpa, Director of the Fund's Mekong Program. ""They run through a catalogue of wildlife in their brain, asking themselves, 'Have I seen this?'"" Perhaps a more startling discovery than the rat was a bright green pit viper scientists spotted slithering through the rafters of a restaurant in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand. The Fund dubbed the Mekong a ""biological treasure trove."" The organization's report ""First Contact in the Greater Mekong"" says 519 plants, 279 fish, 88 frogs, 88 spiders, 46 lizards, 22 snakes, 15 mammals, four birds, four turtles, two salamanders and a toad were found. Scientists are still trying to determine if they have uncovered thousands of new invertebrate species. Scientists are discovering new species at a rate of two per week, said Chungyalpa, who said the reason for publishing the report now was twofold. ""We realized that we should highlight these discoveries in part because of the legacy of war and conflict in the region,"" she said. ""There's an urgency with the threat of development in the Mekong countries."" A horned bovine found in 1991 living in the evergreen forests of the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam has not been found in recent years, she said. Timber development and mining industries are encroaching. There are 150 large hydropower dams that have been constructed along the Mekong river, and another 150 are slated to be built, according to the Fund. Dams that can trap and kill fish are at different stages of planning in the Greater Mekong. High variation in geography and climate zones that enabled species to flourish are now jeopardized by climate change, said Chungyalpa. War is always a threat in countries touched by the Mekong River, particularly Burma. Also known as Myanmar, the largest country by geographical area in mainland Southeast Asia has been ravaged over the years by conflict, political instability and natural disaster. This summer, for example, the United Nations reported that as many as 100,000 people were killed by a cyclone that hit Myanmar. The country's ruling military junta blocked the outside world for weeks before allowing aid to flow into the region. There are cultural obstacles to protecting rare species, too. Many restaurants serve them as food. Restaurants often have rickety bamboo floors that one can look through to see cages filled with exotic animals, Chungyalpa says. The more exotic the animal, the more status it often bestows on the person who consumes it. ""Reports [like the WWF's] are important because these regions can be educated,"" said Maureen Aung-Thwin, the director of The Burma Project, which is funded by the George Soros Foundation and supports local Indonesian organizations working toward an open society. ""People are taking climate change more seriously and even the ruling junta have a forestry NGO. There are glimpses of hope,"" said Aung-Thwin. ""But it's also a situation where someone could step forward and say 'We don't need this' and cut it all down."" WWF said it is working with governments and industry to plan the conservation of more than 231,000 square miles of forest and freshwater habitats that cross borders with all countries in the Greater Mekong.",0.7238194,3964
4,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The world has lost almost one-fifth of its coral reefs according a new report released by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Coral reefs could be wiped out in 30-40 years according to a new report. Compiled by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, the report has brought together the work of researchers from 15 countries with data stretching back 20 years. It's not just climate change -- which raises ocean temperatures and increases seawater acidification -- which is damaging reefs. In some parts of the world overfishing, pollution and invasive species are proving equally harmful. Scientists are warning that reef destruction will have alarming consequences for around 500 million people who rely on coral reefs for their livelihood. Left unchecked, remaining reefs could be completely wiped out by 2050, the report says. Professor Olof Linden from the World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden, told CNN: ""We see a great and imminent threat of more reefs being lost."" Speaking from the U.N. Climate Conference in Poznan, Poland, Professor Linden said that the 19 percent figure is an average. ""For many developing countries like Sri Lanka and countries in East Africa the percentage of damage is much worse. Sometimes three times as high in some places,"" he said. ""In these areas we have local effects like dynamite fishing and other destructive fishing techniques combined the threat of coral mining, unmanaged tourism and all kinds of pollution from agriculture."" But overall the biggest threat to reef survival is climate change. ""The most destructive climate event to impact the coral reefs so far,"" said Linden, ""was the 1998 El Nino which caused major coral bleaching and disrupted ecosystems all over the planet."" iReport.com: What little things are you doing to save the planet? Scientists say reefs have recovered somewhat from those bleaching events. But the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, coupled with coral disease and human effects, have slowed their recuperation. Coral reefs not only provide an income and food for those who live near them, but are also effective natural barriers against storm surges. Despite the report's pessimism, researchers see some encouraging signs. Forty-five percent of the world's reefs are currently in good health and the hope remains that damaged reefs can recover and adjust to the changing conditions. ""We must focus on helping corals to adapt to climate change and on diverting people away from destructive practices such as overfishing,"" Linden said.",0.7208926,6852
5,"(CNN) -- There is one holiday destination that should shake the faith of even the most vehement climate change skeptic: the Carteret Islands, part of Papua New Guinea, located northeast of Bougainville. The Carteret Islands are just one of a number of places already feeling the effects of climate change. The palm trees sway gently under a balmy sun, the beaches are perfect, and stretched out as far as the eye can see is the wide blue of the Pacific Ocean. The only problem with this idyllic scene is that the water is getting closer; slowly but surely, as global warming bites and sea levels rise, the islands are being swallowed up, leaving the few hundred inhabitants pondering an uncertain future. ""King tides and sea surges are floodling the island to a knee high and it is difficult for the salt water to dry up,"" says Ursula Rakova, a Carteret islander and campaigner. ""Fruit trees and nut trees have lost their leaves and only skeleton branches are left standing. The only greenery is from coconut and sago palms... People have no garden food to feed on... We have lost more than 60 percent of our land already."" The problem is that on the Carteret Islands, a horseshoe shaped scatter of small islands around a central lagoon, nowhere is more than 1.2 meters above sea level. If anywhere was the canary in the mine forewarning us of the disaster predicted in low lying areas of the world if runaway climate change takes hold, it's right here. Rakova says there is a growing dependency culture on the island as people rely on international aid for food, which is destroying the social and cultural fabric of the Carterets. ""This is a state of emergency,"" she says. ""Why are the rich nations ignoring the fate of the Carterets Islanders? Are the rich nations waiting for the islanders to float before they can act and put money where their mouths are in terms of human rights?"" It's a cruel irony that the people with some of the lowest carbon footprints are already paying the price for the emissions of far richer countries, and are forced to leave their homes for an uncertain future. But the Carteret Islanders aren't alone. Environmentalists point to Inuit communities threatened by melting ice in Greenland, and those living around the fast-shrinking Lake Chad in Africa, as among many already feeling the effects.  Watch the effects of warming temperatures on Arctic ice » . ""The issue of environmental refugees promises to rank as one of the foremost human crises or our time,"" says British environmentalist and Oxford University professor Norman Myers, who has published extensively on the subject. A report by Friends of the Earth in 2007 identified communities all over the world, from Brazil and Honduras, to Malaysia, Mali, Peru and even the UK, that were directly under threat from a mix of drought, rising sea levels, other extreme weather and disease. Climate refugees: Causing controversy . As much of the primary research on our future climate looks increasingly gloomy -- and privately some scientists will make far blacker predictions than they publish - the world seems faced with a growing challenge. Experts at the climate change conference in Copenhagen in March issued a stark warning when they revised up the scale of projected sea level rises, saying many coastal areas around the world could be completely inundated by 2100. ""It is now clear that there are going to be massive flooding disasters around the globe,"" said Dr David Vaughan, of the British Antarctic Survey, in Copenhagen. As well as low-lying areas of Bangladesh and the Maldives, the scientists warned that the Netherlands could face catastrophic floods, and large areas of Florida and the UK, including the Thames Estuary, may disappear under the waves. But despite the threat of widespread future problems -- and the reality of life for the Carteret Islanders now - the term ""environmental refugees"" remains controversial. Some NGOs, such as Greenpeace, have spoken in terms of 150 million displaced people being driven from their homes by 2050 as climate change makes their lives impossible. Their figures are backed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Other groups, notably the Norwegian Refugee Council, have urged caution and said such quantities are impossible to verify, even suggesting that they could play into the hands of right wing groups keen to create a fear of a tide of immigration. ""Because one cannot completely isolate climate change as a cause however, it is difficult, if not impossible to stipulate any numbers,"" the NRC writes in the 2008 report, Future Flood of Refugees. But while the controversy rages, some experts warn the needs of people such as the Carteret Islanders are being ignored. As the numbers of similar soon-to-be refugees looks likely to grow exponentially, the world needs to wake up to the problem and decide fast how to deal with it. ""There is no legal recognition of people displaced by environmental causes and no international treaty protecting them,"" says Stephanie Long, Climate Coordinator at Friends of the Earth International. Meanwhile back on the Carteret Islanders time is running out and an entire cultural group needs relocating because of rising seas. By 2015 Friends of the Earth International estimate the islands will be largely uninhabitable. Islanders have tried to fight the sea by planting mangroves and building walls, but storm surges and high tides continue to destroy homes and crops, and contaminate fresh water. Since 2007 the slow process of evacuation has been ongoing. Not for the first time, a quiet, remote group of people seem to be slipping through the fingers of the global community. It is unlikely they will be the last. ""I wish that the people causing the melting of the icecaps would do something to help us stay in our homes,"" says John Sailik from Han Island, Carterets. ""Because we love living on our little island.""",0.72014606,2259
6,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The apocalyptic tales of nature's impending demise are as well worn as they are numerous. Dr. Joseph Adelegan has pioneered new energy sources, including using cow waste to create cooking gas. But while our leaders wrangle over quotas for  greenhouse emissions over banquets at lavish summits, there are remarkable individuals who are doing their small bit to prevent our planet from peril. Take Nigerian civil engineer, Dr Joseph Adelegan for instance. He firmly believes that the world's future fuel demands can be met through renewable energy. And he is using increasingly innovative methods to achieve these results. Three years ago Adelegan won plaudits for his ""Cows to Kilowatts"" project, which used effluents and waste products from abattoirs to produce cooking gas. The project was a winner of the prestigious 2005 Supporting Entrepreneurs for Environment and Development (SEED) International Awards. It is still going strong and being used to provide cooking fuel for nearly 6000 homes in Ibadan, southern Nigeria. Adelegan tells CNN there are now plans to roll it out across most of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Kenya and Egypt. This time he's back with another groundbreaking idea to use waste from the cassava plant, a staple food of Nigeria, to generate electricity. His project ""Power to the Poor: Off-Grid Lighting from Cassava Waste in Nigeria,"" was awarded a $250,000 grant in May from the World Bank after being named one of the best projects in Africa. According to Adelegan, Nigeria produces over 20 percent of the world's output of cassava, it is a $5 billion industry and provides the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food. However, waste from cassava refining is a major public health problem in Nigeria, causing water pollution and emitting noxious greenhouse gases. Through innovative biogas technology, zero emission bioreactors at specially constructed plants treat the cassava waste and produce biogas which drives microturbines for low cost, safe and reliable off-grid efficient lighting to thousands of rural homes. Using this method, Adelegan says he hopes to generate 200kw daily, which will provide basic electricity for more than 2000 households initially. He told CNN: ""There will be four lighting points in their homes. We're thinking in terms of basic lighting, they will be able to use their TV, cassette player, that sort of thing, but it will not be able to power a refrigerator. ""These people currently rely on kerosene lamps that are very bad for emissions and pollution. We also plan to provide them with low wattage lamps that use just 5kw to bring down usage."" Through his not-for-profit organization-- Global Network for Environment and Economic Development Research)-- Adelegan has achieved the impressive feat of galvanizing the notoriously bureaucratic Nigerian government into action. He told CNN that the governor of Kwara State, in northern Nigeria has donated a plot of land for the launch of the project, scheduled to start next month. The scheme will cost $310,000 and will become profitable in little over three years, Adelegan says. ""This can never replace fossil fuels because of the huge demand we have for them, but we can help to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating alternative sources of energy,"" he said. The Ice Man Cometh . In the furthest reaches of northern India, glaciers once stretched far down the mountains, now they are all but gone as global warming takes its devastating toll. Hardworking but impoverished farmers in the Ladakh region have watched as their sole source of fresh water slowly melts away. But one man is taking matters into his own hands. Enter Chewang Norphel, a softly-spoken but sprightly 72-year-old has created artificial glaciers and managed to generate water and greenery in this barren landscape. Perched high up in the remote cold deserts of the Himalayas, Norphel has mastered the art of harvesting water by using just a few hundred meters of iron pipes and stone embankments. ""Fifty to sixty years ago, we used to have huge glaciers here, the retired civil engineer, told CNN. ""They have been reduced now because of global warming and now they are on high peaks."" The idea of the 'artificial glacier' was born after he noticed that taps were left running in winter to stop the water from freezing in the pipes. The water then flowed into the drains surrounding the taps and froze. ""And it then occurred to me: 'why not try and make artificial glaciers in the winter?' So that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most,"" Norphel says. The result was a device which traps the waters which melt down the high mountains by turning them into chunks of ice. The largest artificial glacier Norphel has built so far is near the village of Phuktsey. About 1,000 feet (300 meters) long, 150 feet (45 meters) wide, and four feet (1 meter) deep, it supplies irrigation water to the entire village of around 700 people. For Norphel, there are several advantages of an artificial glacier over a natural one. Firstly, it is closer to the village and at a comparatively lower altitude. Natural glaciers, on the other hand, are located way up in the mountains and they melt slowly in summer, releasing water to the villages quite late. Now engineers from other mountainous regions in India and Afghanistan have visited to learn his methods. One artificial glacier costs just $7,000, compared to $34,000 for a dam. Only local materials are needed, and the villagers themselves can build and maintain them. For his efforts, Norphel has been awarded the Far Eastern Economic Review's 1999 Gold Asian Innovation Award, twelve years after he created the first one. However, he is frustrated at the lack of investment and funding to help modernize the design. ""The funding is not sufficient,"" he said. ""We are getting very little amounts and we need a lot more. I hope to get more as this year I want to make two or three more glaciers, with a new design to improve the efficiency."" In 1996, one year after he had retired, Norphel joined the Leh Nutrition Project, a non-governmental organization, as project manager for watershed development. ""Watershed development is the only solution for Ladakh's rural economy. Otherwise, you will have rural folk flocking the city in search of jobs. And there are not many to go around,"" he says.

7,"(CNN) -- Man-made climate change threatens to stress water resources, challenge crops and livestock, raise sea levels and adversely affect human health, according to a report released by the Obama administration on Tuesday. Farmers and workers in central California are suffering through the third year of a worsening drought. The nearly 200-page document on global climate change -- released by the White House science adviser and mandated by Congress -- does not include new research, but encompasses several recent studies on the effects of global warming over the last half century. Among the report's key findings are an ""unequivocal and primarily human-induced"" rise in the Earth's temperature of 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 50 years, and a projection of more rapidly changing temperatures over the next several decades. ""It's not just a problem for the future,"" said Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""We're beginning to see the impact on our daily lives."" The continuing temperature rise is likely to spur a series of negative consequences for the Earth's energy supply, water, transportation, ecosystems and health, the study said. ""[The report] tells us why remedial action is needed sooner rather than later, as well as showing why that action must include both global emissions reductions to reduce the extent of climate change and local adaptation measures to reduce the damage from the changes that are no longer avoidable,"" said John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser. Among the study's specific predictions: Longer and more intense heat waves; increased heavy downpours likely to cause widespread complications such as flooding and waterborne diseases; reduced summer runoff, creating greater competition for water, especially in the West; rising ocean water temperatures that will threaten coral reefs; an increase in wildfires and insect infestations; and more frequent coastal flooding caused by rising seas. The report is the first in almost a decade to break down impacts of climate change on regions and economic sectors of the United States. For example, warming trends in coming decades are expected to reduce the lobster catch in the waters of the Northeast, increase the intensity of hurricanes in the Southeast and accelerate drought in the Southwest, it said. Authors of the comprehensive report said they hope it can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers and other Americans, such as farmers making crop decisions or local governments passing zoning restrictions in coastal areas. The report comes as Congress debates a White House-backed climate change bill that seeks to reduce the United State's greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a so-called ""cap and trade"" program. The bill cleared a key House committee vote in May and could be considered by the entire chamber within the next two weeks, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday. The bill's future remains unclear in the Senate, where leaders are holding off advancing their own version of the legislation until it clears the lower chamber.",0.7109653,6585
9,"(CNN) -- The Arctic as we know it may soon be a thing of the past. Musk ox in the Arctic check the spread of shrubs to the High Arctic, but promote grass growth. That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic. Published in ""Science"" magazine, Post and his team of international scientist conducted the study during the fourth International Polar Year that ended in 2008. ""It seems no matter where you look -- on the ground, in the air, or in the water -- we're seeing signs of rapid change,"" said Post in a press statement. The report found that flora and fauna of the Arctic are responding in various ways to the region's changes in climate over the last 150 years, and more recently the 20 to 30 years where seasonal minimal sea ice coverage has declined by 45,000 square kilometers per year. With the decline in sea ice and snow, animals usually seen at lower latitudes are being found in more northerly regions, including red foxes that have been displacing native Arctic foxes.  View the gallery of Arctic life affected by climate change » . The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. With less snow cover and a longer growing season, these non-migratory reindeer have taken advantage of the increased plant abundance, with the result that reindeer populations and their ability to reproduce are up, while mortality is down. But other animals are not adapting well to rising temperatures and the effect on delicate ecosystems. Migratory caribou in low Arctic Greenland and elsewhere are declining in number as they have not been able to keep their calving season in synch with changes in plant growth. With the decline in caribou comes a knock-on effect to native Inuit hunters, according to the report's authors. Hotter summers could result in more insects and parasites that prey on the caribou, which could then also reduce the annual caribou harvest by local indigenous peoples. ""Inuit hunters at my study site in Greenland have all but given up on hunting caribou there. What will be the next component to disappear from their traditional lifestyle, a lifestyle that has worked for thousands of years?"" said Post. Iconic Arctic animals dependent sea ice, including Pacific walrus, ringed seal, hooded seal, ivory gull, narwhal and polar bear, are faring especially badly, said the report. The researchers found that polar bears and ringed seals, both of which give birth in lairs or caves under the snow, lose many newborn pups when the lairs collapse in unusually early spring rains. These species may be headed for extinction, said the report.",0.70986104,6781
10,"(CNN) -- Undisturbed tropical forests are absorbing nearly one-fifth of the CO2 released by burning fossil fuels, a new study has found. Trees in undisturbed tropical forests are soaking up more CO2 than people realized. The scientific report published in ""Nature"" magazine suggests that the world's remaining tropical forests remove 4.8 billion tons of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere each year. This includes a previously unknown carbon sink in Africa, which annually absorbs 1.2 billion tons of CO2. The study was based on taken data on African tropical forests from the past 40 years and has shown that for at least the past few decades each hectare of intact African forest has trapped an extra 0.6 tonnes of carbon per year. The scientists then analyzed the new African data together with South American and Asian findings to assess the total sink in tropical forests. Analysis of these 250,000 tree records reveals that, on average, remaining undisturbed forests are trapping carbon, showing that they are a globally significant carbon sink. ""We are receiving a free subsidy from nature,"" said Dr. Simon Lewis from the University of Leeds, and the lead author of the paper, in a press statement. ""Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18 percent of the CO2 added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of climate change."" The study also found that trees of comparable age are gaining girth, though the reasons are unclear. For example, a 20-year-old tree is on average bigger than a 20-year-old tree measured a decade ago. A leading suspect is the extra CO2 in the atmosphere, which may act as a fertilizer.. However, Lewis warns, ""Whatever the cause, we cannot rely on this sink forever. Even if we preserve all remaining tropical forest, these trees will not continue getting bigger indefinitely."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that each year human activity emits 32 billion tons of CO2, but only 15 billion tons actually remain in the atmosphere adding to climate change. The new research suggests just where some of the ""missing"" 17 billion tons per year is going. ""It's well known that about half of the 'missing' carbon is being dissolved in to the oceans, and that the other half is going somewhere on land in vegetation and soils, but we were not sure precisely where. According to our study about half the total carbon 'land sink' is in tropical forest trees,"" Lewis said. The protection of tropical forests is likely to become a key theme at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in November in Copenhagen, Denmark. Co-author on the study, Dr. Lee White, Gabon's chief climate change scientist said, ""To get an idea of the value of the sink, the removal of nearly 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests, based on realistic prices for a ton of carbon, should be valued at around £13 billion ($18.5 billion) per year. This is a compelling argument for conserving tropical forests."" Dr. Lewis added, ""Predominantly rich polluting countries should be transferring substantial resources to countries with tropical forests to reduce deforestation rates and promote alternative development pathways.""",0.70905507,1782
11,"(CNN) -- We all know what happens when urban sprawl gets out of control: Commutes back up, smog thickens, and concrete suburbs gobble up green spaces. The oceans are growing crowded, and governments are increasingly trying to plan their use. But what about ""ocean sprawl""? Until recently, no one gave that idea much thought. But the oceans, like the land, have gotten crowded, and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public-owned seas from turning into sprawling, watery versions of Houston, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia. ""The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development,"" said Amanda Leland, ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. ""Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish. We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world."" In an attempt to address this and other crowding problems, governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters. The Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning. By September, the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that's designed to protect ocean ecology, address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies. A handful of states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are charting similar courses. Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters, which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year. One of the state's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state's waters -- without angering fishing industries, killing whales or harming ecosystems. Internationally, several European countries, including Denmark, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France, are pioneering the new field, said Fanny Douvere, a co-principal investigator at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Ocean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming. One reason it's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up, said Sandra Whitehouse, a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group. ""The majority of the ecosystem is under the water,"" Whitehouse said. ""So it's out of sight, out of mind. We're only looking at the surface."" Beneath the water, though, overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse. By one report, wild fish could disappear by mid-century. The energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water. Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales. Fish farms are growing in some countries. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry. And power lines, reefs, lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space. In Europe's North Sea, expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available, said Douvere, of UNESCO. What happens on land also affects the oceans. A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year, coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat. Furthermore, pavement on land creates ""expressways"" for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean. ""Every eight months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,"" the report says. When the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea, the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan, said Whitehouse, of the Ocean Conservancy. ""There's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy,"" she said, ""but it's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way, because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans."" Since there are new uses but not new space, planning is necessary, said Charles Ehler, another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. He added, ""There's not enough space for everything, and there are going to have to be trade-offs that are made."" Current efforts focus on broad public interest rather than specific conflicts, Ehler said. Until now, the ocean primarily was divvied up in a sort of ""free-for-all"" in which ""whoever gets there first gets the access,"" he said. Leland, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the patchwork of federal agencies managing the oceans in the United States contributes to the problem. More than 140 federal laws govern the ocean's use; and six federal departments, along with dozens of agencies, are in charge of implementing those laws, according to the Pew Oceans Commission report. Charles M. Wahle, a marine ecologist and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Obama's ocean-planning efforts are a complete shift in thinking. ""We're acknowledging that we want and need to use the ocean in a lot of different ways,"" he said. ""They all have standing, and we need to figure out a way to allocate them fairly and sustainably."" He added, ""Fifty years from now, you should be able to go to a place [in the ocean] and know what will be happening there."" There are skeptics of the shift. Commercial fisheries are hampered by current regulations and could be further harmed if the ocean is divided up among too many groups, said Jim Ruhle, president of Commercial Fishermen of America, an industry group. ""We make our livelihoods from that ocean, and we want to make sure that we have reasonable plans in effect to allow that to take place,"" he said. Some other fishing groups oppose new ocean uses, like offshore wind energy, entirely. Despite this new emphasis on planning, there's still a chance that ocean waters could go the way of haphazard cities. ""The proof will be in the pudding,"" said Wahle, of NOAA. But he said it's exciting that so many groups are on board for a new way of thinking. ""If we do our jobs right, overall, the oceans will be healthier, ecosystems will be more productive, people will derive more services and benefits and value from those ecosystems,"" he said, ""and industry will be able to plan and commit and invest in ways that actually work.""",0.70678157,5271
12,"(CNN) -- They may live on separate continents, in different countries with differing cultures, but the same message is being echoed by the world's poor, according to a new report by aid agency Oxfam. Farmers in Uganda have little choice but to attempt to cultivate crops on arid land. The report, ""Suffering the Science,"" tells the stories of people who are discovering to their detriment that long-held truths about seasons and rainfall no longer apply. ""I travel a lot and people are always saying to me, 'the seasons have changed,'""Oxfam chief executive Barbara Stocking told CNN. ""I think there's a real sense of uncertainty. People have lost confidence. They have a very close relationship with the Earth, nature and climate and suddenly they're finding that it doesn't work anymore."" People such as Florence Madamu from western Uganda. ""The sun is prolonged until the end of September,"" she told Oxfam. ""And whenever it rains it rains so heavily it destroys all our crops in the fields. You can plant a whole acre or two and come out with nothing."" July is a particularly harsh month in large swathes of Africa. It's the peak hunger season and this year people are expected to be more vulnerable than usual following record high food prices in 2008. Laborers are planting precious seeds in fields of dirt with no guarantee they'll produce a harvest, while the conditions they're working under are becoming more extreme. ""For me the big worry is that many of them don't know why it's happening so they can't actually help themselves prepare for the changes,"" Stocking told CNN. ""We need to work with them to help them become more resilient -- whether it's cyclones and weather-related disasters or whether it's a long-term change. They need to be prepared for very different sorts of seasons now."" And for unfamiliar diseases. Higher temperatures are encouraging the migration of malaria and other vector-borne diseases into new areas where, in some cases, health authorities are ill-equipped to cope. Oxfam found Iha at her daughter's bedside in a hospital in Indonesia. Twelve-year-old Laila was the second of her children to contract dengue fever at their home on the island of Java. ""They said that this is a new type of dengue fever,"" Iha told Oxfam. ""She has already had 30 bags of infusion water. After nine days her condition is still not stable."" It is the stories of people such as Iha who are living with the consequences of climate change that Oxfam hopes will prompt action from leaders of developed nations who are meeting in L'Aquila, Italy this week. ""Ideally what we'd like is the G8 countries to come out very clearly as to what their targets are for carbon emissions reductions by 2020 and the amounts of money needed,"" Stocking said. ""It's unlikely they'll be as precise about that,"" she conceded, adding, ""but we really need some good strong wording in the G8 communiqué about the recognition that for a deal to be done [in Copenhagen], money will be needed for the poorest countries."" Talks in Copenhagen in December are being billed as an unmissable opportunity for developed and developing nations to agree a global plan to combat climate change. Stocking commended a proposal by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to establish a $100 billion annual fund to help developing nations contend with climate change, but said closer to $150 billion was needed. Oxfam points out that's about the same amount the U.S. government spent on bailing out insurance company AIG. While scientists warn that a cut of 40 percent in carbon emissions by 2020 is vital to avoid severe repercussions, developed nations have yet to commit to anything close. ""We need America to come forward much more positively,"" Stocking said. ""It's really got to stand up to the bar clearly if there's going to be any deal."" ""We're really pressing as well for the EU to come out much more clearly about what it will do it as a whole. ""There isn't even a Council of Minister's meeting until October and that's going to be far too late. There needs to be some serious meetings including heads of state very quickly now to get an agreement to put something very direct on the table,"" she said.",0.7033719,5072
13,"(CNN) -- As a hobby, Suzie Jirachareonkul, a teacher and mother of two, spends many of her nights searching for endangered toads on the country roads near her home outside Cape Town, South Africa. Volunteers in South Africa are collecting data on the Western Leopard Toad, which is endangered. She often finds them flattened on the street. ""They're so beautiful and it's just really hard to live with, especially when you're living on the road right here,"" the 33-year-old said of the toad deaths. ""So we started doing something about it. We started saving them off the road in the middle of the rain."" When a scientist caught onto her efforts, Jirachareonkul and a friend assembled about 20 volunteers -- a group she calls the ""Toad NUTS"" -- to collect data on the endangered Western Leopard Toad. The information they collect is being used in scientific research. Each time Jirachareonkul comes upon one of the spotted, faintly iridescent creatures, she springs into action. She marks down GPS coordinates, measures the toad, makes notes on its behavior (Is a mate stuck to its back? Is it headed toward a pond?) and uploads the information so scientists can use it. Oh, and she moves the toad out of traffic's way, too. While her nighttime hobby may sound a bit strange, Jirachareonkul is far from alone in her efforts to collect amateur scientific data. At a time when climate change and urbanization are poised to set off a new wave of extinction, some members of the scientific community are turning toward backyard biologists for the data they need to monitor ecosystems and protect struggling species. This ""citizen science"" movement is not exactly new, but it has grown fresh legs as the Internet and social-networking sites help people with uber-specified and often bizarre interests gang up for a cause. Amateur-produced Web sites now serve as data hubs for squirrel sightings, bird photos, ant anthologies, snapshots of leaves, flowers and trees, water quality info, beetle hunts and firefly tracking, among others. Find links at CNN's SciTech blog . ""It's pretty random,"" said Cyndy Parr of the Encyclopedia of Life. ""There's a lot of charismatic things that won't surprise you -- backyard birds, that sort of thing. But there are also thriving communities of people who like to take pictures of butterflies, centipedes, wildflowers, plants."" Some of the sites have sweeping goals. The Encyclopedia of Life, which seeks to gather online information on all known species, has started taking public submissions through a public Flickr group. Some individual users have uploaded more than 2,000 photos. Project BudBurst, out of Boulder, Colorado, aims to collect so much amateur data about plant species that scientists will be able to tell how climate change is altering the seasons in North America. The venture, managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, gathers ""data that would not otherwise be collected,"" said Sandra Henderson, the project's director. ""We have these additional sentinel eyes on the landscape, if you will. There aren't enough ecologists to be making all of these different plant observations."" National Science Foundation funding for citizen science dropped off significantly in 2002 but generally has been on the rise since, according to budget numbers compiled for CNN. Since that year, funding in the United States has increased more than 240 percent, to more than $3 million for 2008. Several of the Web projects receive government funding, but others survive on their own merits. In Spain, Josep del Hoyo founded the Internet Bird Collection, an international compilation of bird videos, sounds and photos that's funded solely by his company. He said the intense passion of birders around the world, plus some money from his publishing company, keep the site running. Amateurs have posted video of never-before-seen birds on the site, he said, and some of the work has been the foundation for scientific articles. Technology is amplifying this passion for citizen science, which has been around since scientists started cataloging species. Researchers at several universities are working on iPhone applications and computer programs that could analyze digital photos of plant leaves and automatically identify the plant's species. When those photos -- from ordinary people all over the world -- are paired with the photographer's location and uploaded to a database, the information would be more valuable than anything scientists could come up with on their own, said John Kress, a botanist and research scientist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The information could help scientists know if a species is going extinct or dying off in certain regions as the climate warms. Identifying a plant species can be tricky, Kress said, so these technologies also would ensure that nonprofessional data is good enough to use for scientific research. ""When people do these things as citizen scientists you're always a little suspect as to, 'Are you getting it right?' "" he said. ""There's some plants out there that are maples and look like oaks -- and only I would know they're really maples. But with this system we would have a standard way of identifying the accuracy of this information."" Some scientists said they're excited about the trend toward citizen-submitted data because it is impossible for scientists to document all of the changes going on around the world. ""At some point it will really lead to almost a democratization of science, where the amateurs and the volunteers are having just as much of an impact on science as the professionals are,"" said Rick Bonney, who started a citizen science project with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 1987. ""It's just going so fast I can't keep up with it anymore."" Others find the movement limited or controversial. The relationship between formal science and citizen science is similar to that between professional news reporters and bloggers; some scientists worry that the information coming in from nonprofessionals will be inaccurate, said John Musinsky, a senior director at Conservation International. The citizen efforts are also limited in the sense that, at least for now, they're largely concentrated in North America and Europe, where there aren't nearly as many plant and animal species as in Latin America and Africa. That's beginning to change, though, said Conrad Savy, a conservation science adviser at Conservation International. ""It's gaining steam,"" he said of the global citizen-science movement. ""It's working very well and it's a great way also to engage the community in conservation issues."" As photo-taking cell phones become more popular in developing countries, a more diverse group will join the efforts, said Kress, the Smithsonian botanist. Jirachareonkul's group devoted to the Western Leopard Toad now works with the South African National Biodiversity Institute to promote understanding of the endangered species. Dr. John Measey, a researcher with the institute, said by e-mail that some research on the toad would be possible without the volunteer efforts. But the ""Toad NUTS"" raise awareness and help scientists ""obtain usable accurate data from a much wider area than we could possibly manage or fund,"" he wrote. When Jirachareonkul started the project, she didn't know much about the toads -- they were just a creature she found squashed in front of her house. Now she has a personal connection to them. She said citizen science is a way for people to connect with their local environment -- and to make a difference. ""There are so many problems in the world, but I think the main problem is that everybody is worried about everybody else's problems that they don't focus in on their little areas,"" she said.",0.7021089,6785

William tells me he went out on a boat with some friends a few days ago and shot the whale. I'm not sure how I feel about this. Welcome to Greenland. On this remote but enormous island subsistence whale hunting is allowed. This was just the memorable start to an extraordinary journey.

They say their mission is to help scientists working in the region and to publicize the environmental changes taking place here. We join the Arctic Sunrise as it moves slowly up Sermilik Fjord. This is simply the most beautiful place I've ever seen. It's an inky blue body of water thick with floating, ancient ice. Some of the icebergs are mountainous. They all come from the Greenland ice sheet, a vast mass of frozen fresh water, hundreds of miles across and up to two miles thick.  View the gallery of the stunning landscape » . Over the next four days we observe independent scientists working to understand why the ice sheet is melting so rapidly. We fly over and land on Helheim Glacier, a major outlet for the ice sheet which has sped up dramatically in the last decade. We accompany oceanographers in inflatable boats as they collect data on the warming water currents in the fjord. All this research, they say, points to sea levels rising beyond current predictions. There are still those who question humankind's role in the warming of the Earth's climate, but these scientists are not among them. ""Things could be very bad,"" glaciologist Dr Gordon Hamilton tells me. ""If we don't start to do something about it now we'll very quickly reach a tipping point from which there'll be no return. And the consequences for society as a whole would be catastrophic."" Joining Greenpeace on this expedition was a difficult decision for CNN. Does it compromise our editorial independence on what can still be a highly divisive issue? In my experience it's no different to embedding with soldiers on one side of a military conflict. I've traveled with American soldiers in Iraq and Russian soldiers in Georgia. It enables journalists to access newsworthy locations and people that we couldn't get to otherwise, either practically or safely. And the stories told can still be balanced and fair.

15,"(CNN) -- Between 1.5 trillion and 2 trillion tons of ice in Greenland, Antarctica and Alaska have melted at an accelerating rate since 2003, according to NASA scientists, in the latest signs of what they say is global warming. This image shows the changing rate of mass in mountain glaciers on the Gulf of Alaska. Using new satellite technology that measures changes in mass in mountain glaciers and ice sheets, NASA geophysicist Scott Luthcke concluded that the losses amounted to enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay 21 times. ""The ice tells us in a very real way how the climate is changing,"" said Luthcke, who will present his findings this week at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco, California. NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, mission uses two orbiting satellites to measure the ""mass balance"" of a glacier, or the net annual difference between ice accumulation and ice loss. ""A few degrees of change [in temperature] can increase the amount of mass loss, and that contributes to sea level rise and changes in ocean current,"" Luthcke said. The data reflects findings from NASA colleague Jay Zwally, who uses different satellite technology to observe changing ice volume in Greenland, the Arctic and Antarctica. In the past five years, Greenland has lost between 150 gigatons and 160 gigatons each year, (one gigaton equals one billion tons) or enough to raise global sea levels about .5 mm per year, said Zwally, who will also present his findings at the conference this week. GRACE measured that mountain glaciers in the Gulf of Alaska lost about 84 gigatons each year, about five times the average annual flow of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, according to NASA. ""Every few extra inches of sea level have very significant economic impacts, because they change the sea level, increase flooding and storm damage,"" said, Zwally, ICESat Project Scientist. ""It's a warning sign."" Melting ice, especially in Greenland and the Arctic, is also thought to contribute to global warming, Zwally said. When the vast ice sheets and glaciers melt, they lose their reflective power, and instead, oceans and land absorb the heat, causing the Arctic waters and the atmosphere to warm faster. ""We're seeing the impacts of global warming in many areas of our own lives, like agriculture,"" Zwally said. As an example, he cited the pine beetle infestation of this summer in the forests of Colorado and western Canada. ""They were believed to be spreading because the winter was not cold enough to kill them, and that's destroying forests,"" he said. In the 1990s, Greenland took in as much snow and water as it let out, Zwally said. But now, about 15 years later, sea levels are rising about 50 percent faster, making the global climate situation even more unpredictable. ""The best estimates are that sea levels will rise about 18 to 36 inches by the end of the century, but because of what's going on and how fast things are changing, there's a lot of uncertainty,"" he said.",0.6937067,4267
16,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The concept may be radical, but it might just have to be if the worst predictions of climate change are realized. The Lilypad as imagined by architect Vincent Callebaut moored off the coast of Monaco. The Lilypad, a floating ecopolis for climatic refugees, is the creation of Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut. ""It is"" he says, ""a true amphibian, half aquatic and half terrestrial city, able to accommodate 50,000 inhabitants and inviting biodiversity"". Callebaut imagines his structure at 250 times the scale of a lilypad, with a skin made of polyester fibres coated in titanium dioxide which would react with ultraviolet light and absorb atmospheric pollution. The Lilypad comprises of three marinas and three mountain regions with streets and structures strewn with foliage. ""The goal is to create a harmonious coexistence of humans and nature,"" said Callebaut. With a central fresh water lagoon acting as ballast, the whole construction would be carbon neutral utilizing solar, thermal, wind, hydraulic, tidal and osmotic energies. With high density populations living in low-lying areas -- The Netherlands, Polynesia, Bangladesh -- the ecopolis, its creator believes, could be the answer to mass human displacement that global warming is predicted to cause. In its most recent 2007 report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted sea levels will rise by 60-90 cm during this century. Some climate scientists like James Hansen think that if greenhouse gas emissions aren't checked then those figures might be much, much worse. In practice, Callebaut envisages the Lilypad sailing the seas, following currents like a futuristic cruise ship. He also thinks that it could ""widen sustainability in offshore territories of the most developed countries such as Monaco"". You can't help thinking that the well-heeled residents of the Principality might have a thing or two to say about 50,000 climatic refugees bobbing around in the harbour, but you cannot fault Callebaut's ambition. His previous creations -- showcased on his website -- reveal an imagination working at full throttle with sustainable design lying at its heart. Anti-Smog -- a prototype of depolluting architecture and Ecomic -- an ecotower rising up from the foundations of Aztec ruins are two further examples of his eco design credentials. The Perfumed Jungle, Fields in Fields and The Fractured Monolith may sound like titles for various genres of novel but are, in fact, names for sustainable projects in Callebaut's growing portfolio.

17,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Six heat-trapping gases that contribute to air pollution pose potential health hazards, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday in a landmark announcement that could lead to regulation of the gases. ""This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem,"" EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said. The gases -- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride -- have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world, the EPA said. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA's scientific review in 2007. ""This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations,"" EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said in a release, later adding, ""The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate."" The EPA's finding now goes into a public comment period. The report, titled ""Assessment of the Impacts of Global Change on Regional U.S. Air Quality: A Synthesis of Climate Change Impacts on Ground-Level Ozone,"" is the culmination of a study started in 2000, the EPA said. The White House moved quickly to try to squelch any concerns that the EPA would immediately issue any regulations concerning the gases. ""The president has made clear his strong preference that Congress act to pass comprehensive legislation rather than address the climate challenge through administrative action,"" White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said. ""That's why the president has repeatedly called for a bill to provide for market-based solutions to reduce carbon pollution and transition to a clean-energy economy that creates millions of green jobs."" The EPA announcement comes amid efforts by Congress to enact a limit on global warming pollution. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin hearings next week on a comprehensive energy and climate bill, called the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Committee Chairman Henry Waxman is said to want the bill out of committee by Memorial Day, which falls on May 25, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wants to bring the bill to the House floor for a vote this year. Environmentalists hailed the EPA's announcement, with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund calling it a ""historic step ... [that] formally determined that global warming pollution 'endangers' the nation's human health and well-being."" ""The U.S. is taking its first steps as a nation to confront climate change,"" said Vickie Patton, deputy general counsel at the environmental advocacy group. ""Global warming threatens our health, our economy, and our children's prosperity. EPA's action is a wake-up call for national policy solutions that secure our economic and environmental future."" But critics say the finding will just produce a ""glorious mess."" ""Today's action by the EPA is the beginning of a regulatory barrage that will destroy jobs, raise energy prices for consumers and undermine America's global competitiveness,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""It now appears EPA's regulatory reach will find its way into schools, hospitals, assisted living facilities and just about any activity that meets minimum thresholds in the Clean Air Act."" The EPA notes in an accompanying report released Friday that global warming could make ozone pollution worse in some parts of the United States. Future ozone management decisions may have to take into account the possible effects of global warming, the report says. ""Climate change, along with other aspects of global change, including changes in population, land use and the technologies employed for energy production and transportation, may alter the capacity for U.S. states to successfully attain the national air quality standards in the future,"" the report concludes. Ground-level ozone is formed when sunlight causes a chemical reaction in the air between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by motor vehicles and industrial plants. Ozone levels are typically higher on sunny days in areas that have many vehicles or smoke-stack industries. Global warming also could increase the number of days with weather conditions conducive to forming ozone, potentially causing air quality alerts earlier in the spring and later in the fall, the report says. In addition to health problems, the report says global warming could lead to increased drought, more heavy downpours and flooding, and more frequent and intense heat waves and wildfires. Global warming could also cause a greater rise in sea level, more intense storms and harm to water resources, agriculture, wildlife and ecosystems, the report said.

18,"(CNN) -- Ever caught a glimpse of the secretive Iberian lynx? Or heard the croaking bark of a Mediterranean monk seal? Arctic foxes are trapped and skinned for the pelts. If not, and you want to do so, you had better hurry because pollution and habitat degradation have pushed both species to the brink of extinction. According to a recent study by the Switzerland-based World Conservation Union (IUCN) human activity is threatening almost one-sixth of Europe's total land mammal population. Among marine mammals the situation is even more grave, with some 22 percent of total numbers being pushed towards annihilation. The IUCN's recently published European Mammal Assessment identified 17 European mammal species that are ""vulnerable,"" seven that are ""endangered,"" and six that are ""critically endangered."" The Mediterranean monk seal population, for example, has now dwindled to just 350-450 individuals. The outlook for the Iberian lynx is even worse, with only an estimated 150 still surviving, making it the most endangered cat species on earth. Other species on the critically endangered list include the Arctic fox, Bavarian pine vole, European mink and North Atlantic Right whale. ""This new assessment proves that many European mammals are declining at an alarming rate,"" said IUCN Director-General Julia Marton-Lefèvre, a position echoed by the EU's Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas. ""The results of the report highlight the challenge we currently face to halt the loss of Europe's biodiversity,"" said Dimas. ""It is clear that the full implementation of the Habitats Directive (adopted by the EU in 1992 to safeguard Europe's endangered wildlife) is of the utmost importance to protect Europe's native mammals."" Europe is home to a rich diversity of native mammal species ranging from the small such as shrews and voles, to the large such as wolves and brown bears. to the enormous -- in the case of the 70-ton North Atlantic Right Whale. Human activity, however, especially in the form of agriculture, deforestation, hunting and pollution, has reduced the numbers of these species, leaving many of them in danger of vanishing. The aforementioned Habitats Directive -- a corollary of the 1979 Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats -- introduced a range of measures aimed at protecting endangered species (including plants, birds and fish as well as mammals). That directive has certainly had an effect, with a number of mammals that previously seemed destined to disappear from Europe now enjoying something of a revival. The Alpine Ibex, for example, was almost hunted out in the 19th century, its population reduced to just a small group of survivors in Italy's Gran Paradiso National Park. Thanks to extensive conservation and protection efforts, however, the species is once again flourishing and has been downgraded to the ""least concern"" category on the IUCN's ""Red List."" It is the same story for the European bison, which was limited to just a few zoos before re-introduction programs across eastern Europe helped re-build the population to current levels of around 1,800. ""The fate of the European bison provides an example of the way in which a species may be brought to the brink of extinction in a very short time, and then saved only through great efforts,"" said Dr. Zbigniew Krasinski of Poland's Bialowieza National Park. ""The saving of the bison has been an undoubted success, although further action will continue to be essential."" Dr. Jean-Christophe Vie, Deputy Head of the IUCN's Species Program, agrees that significant progress has been made. ""In Europe we now have a network of protected areas, as well as strong conservation laws,"" he told CNN. ""It is possible for species to recover even when their numbers drop to extinction level. ""Both the Alpine Ibex and European bison are recovering well because of appropriate conservation measures. ""The European beaver is another example. It was persecuted almost to extinction but has now been re-introduced and is colonizing all over the continent."" While there are positive stories, however, the overall picture remains a disheartening one, as the European Mammal Assessment demonstrates. Commissioned by the European Commission and a year in the drafting, it is the first such overview of its kind and draws on the work of a Europe-wide group of scientists, zoologists and conservationists. Its findings provide an unequivocal picture of biodiversity loss and species decline. Habitat destruction, usually due to agricultural practices, is the key driver of that decline, although many other factors are involved, including pollution, disease and the introduction of invasive foreign species. The case of the European mink, one of the IUCN's six critically endangered European mammals, is an example of how different elements can combine to drive a particular species to the brink of destruction. Once found in great numbers across Europe from Spain to the Urals, the mink population has plummeted in recent years. While hunting has certainly contributed to this decline, the main causes have been habitat loss and competition from invasive foreign species, according to Vie. ""The mink is freshwater dependent,"" explains Vie. ""The more you damage its habitat by polluting rivers, or channeling them, or building dams, the more the population declines."" The introduction of the American mink into Europe for fur-rearing also proved disastrous, with some of those mink escaping from captivity, establishing their own colonies in the wild and setting up direct competition for food and resources with the native population. The result: an 80 percent decline in that population in the last decade alone (in 1993 the IUCN only classified it as ""vulnerable""). But experts say that species loss can be reversed. ""There is more and more perception across Europe that biodiversity conservation is crucially important,"" says Vie. ""And we are seeing good recoveries in some species. ""The picture in the mammal world is not nearly as bad as, say, among freshwater fish, where the number of threatened species is far, far higher."" At the same time, the latest figures remain a source of considerable concern. At a time when so many conservation initiatives and laws are already in operation, the population of many European mammal species is in apparent free fall. It is not simply the possibility of losing a particular species that worries experts, but also how the loss will affect the species' wider ecosystem . ""The food web is extremely complex,"" says Vie. ""If you lose one element that has a very specific role in that web, it has a knock-on effect and the whole system is threatened. ""It is very worrying. Some people think it is a disaster if a famous painting is lost in a fire, but that is just the work of a few weeks or months. These species and systems are the product of millions of years of evolution. ""I am biased, of course, but I think it would be an absolute tragedy if we lost these native species.""

19,"DOHA, Qatar (CNN) -- One look outside the window gives a glimpse of the ""economics of energy"" in Doha, Qatar. Cranes dot the tops of half-finished towers, a monumental work in progress; the result of vast energy wealth being pumped out of the ground and poured into project after project. Doha, Qatar: A city skyline awash with cranes and towers powered by abundant oil and gas supplies. It's here that our Principal Voices met for the first of this year's roundtables. Outside Qatar, the economics of energy present a very different picture. Rising fuel costs are pricing power out of the means of some of the world's poorest people. And the environmental cost of continuing to exploit the world's fossil fuel supplies is now almost universally agreed to be so great that society can no longer afford to ignore it. Our Principal Voices come from diverse backgrounds: . The Icelandic President Olafur Grimsson -- the first head of state to sit on a Principal Voices panel -- grew up on a small island in the North Atlantic Ocean and over the past forty years has witnessed the country abandon coal to become the world's first clean economy. Dr Joseph Adelegan from Nigeria has seen poverty first hand in Africa where he worked closely with villagers to convert slaughterhouse waste to gas they use for cooking. And, Qatar-based businessman Hesham Ismail AbdulRahman Al Emadi is leading an ambitious project to create a global network of ""Energy Cities"" to house the oil and gas industry. For an hour and a half they spoke about how to solve what Icelandic President Grimsson called, ""the most fundamental question of the 21st century"": energy and whether there will ever be enough alternative sources of power to satisfy global demand if, and only if, the world manages to shake its addiction to oil and other fossil fuels. They spoke not only about the need to find alternatives to traditional energy sources, but whether there'll ever be a concerted effort in developed countries to conserve rather than consume precious resources. So what is holding us back? ""We are creatures of habit,"" Grimsson offered by way of explanation, adding that ""it usually takes a crisis to bring about change"". He warned that there is one potential disaster looming: the predicted melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas in 30 to 40 years which will cause catastrophic flooding in India and China. ""This is not just a discussion about the rich, about cities or about Europe or America or even China or India, the great economic powerhouses. This is also a question about the poorest of the poor."" In a response to an emailed question about whether the developed world should face sanctions for not meeting any targets set by the international community on climate change, Dr Joseph Adelegan called for aid to help poorer countries --like the ones in Africa -- find alternatives to fossil fuels. The Middle East is facing different challenges. Hesham Al Emadi says energy subsidies in Gulf Cooperation Council countries and ignorance of the issues provide little incentive for residents to conserve energy or find greener alternatives: ""there is lots of ignorance. Awareness is a major issue."" And what of countries like the U.S.? Would higher taxes on fuel be enough to move residents in the right direction? Acknowledging he's an optimist and ""a great friend of America,"" Grimsson said, politically, all the elements are already in place for a big shift in attitudes in the U.S. ""McCain, Hillary and Obama are all on the positive issue, as I call it,"" he said. He also said the world might be wise to look to the Middle East for guidance. ""I believe they are probably more aware than we are that the odds are that oil will run out sooner rather than later,"" Grimsson said, adding ""A visionary leader of a country who wants to create a good living for his or her grandchildren or great grandchildren thinks about these issues.""

20,"(CNN) -- U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday will designate nine sites in three areas of the central Pacific as marine national monuments, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday. The new designated areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world. The new areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world -- 195,280 square miles -- and, coupled with a 138,000-square mile designation in Hawaii two years go, mean that Bush will have protected more of the ocean than any other president. ""The president's actions will prevent the destruction and extraction of natural resources from these beautiful and biologically diverse areas without conflicting with our military's activities and freedom of navigation, which are vital to our national security,"" Perino said. ""And the public and future generations will benefit from the science and knowledge gained from these areas."" Bush is using the 1906 Antiquities Act -- first used by President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside public lands such as the Grand Canyon as national monuments -- for the designation. Many of those lands later became national parks. Bill Chandler, vice president for government affairs for the non-profit Marine Conservation Biology Institute (MCBI), said Bush is ""to be commended"" for his action. ""From a conservation history perspective, the message here is that Teddy Roosevelt laid the groundwork for our national park system when he withdrew a lot of public lands and called them national monuments,"" said Chandler. ""We see the president laying the foundation for a system of national marine preserves and parks,"" he said. ""We had lacked such a system for a long time."" MCBI and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) partnered to identify eight of the nine sites the president will set aside on Tuesday. All but one of those eight remote areas already have Fish and Wildlife Service refuge areas at their cores. ""You have a core conservation mission already,"" Chandler said. ""This is just basically going to expand them."" The MCBI/EDF-identified sites are Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island. Rose Atoll, part of American Samoa, is the smallest atoll in the world, but more than 500 fish species swim in the waters around it, and it supports 97 percent of America Samoa's seabird population. It is also the nesting ground for several threatened turtle species. The Pew Environmental Fund identified the ninth site -- the waters around the northern Marianas and the deepest ocean canyon in the world, the Mariana Trench, 11,033 meters (36,201 feet) at its deepest. The new designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands, where commercial fishing will be prohibited. Other uses of the area -- research or recreational fishing -- will be allowed but will require a permit. Bush has not gotten rave reviews for his conservation efforts on land -- according to the Audubon Society, he's signed wilderness legislation covering a little more than 2 million acres, fewer than any other president except Richard Nixon. But Chandler said that Bush ""has really embraced ocean conservation as his own."" ""Ocean protection ... is lagging 50 to 100 years behind land conservation, he said. ""This is precisely the kind of leadership that we need to get the message across that there are places in the ocean that are rich with diversity."" ""Scientists already know this,"" he said. ""They have been calling for this for 10 or 15 years."" The president can cut through the bureaucracy that makes protecting resources such a lengthy process, and the Antiquities Act is a strong tool for those efforts. With the Act, the president can make a designation by executive order, essentially ""writing the prescription for conservation"" for an area, Chandler said.",0.6784214,9372
21,"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for tighter controls over tourism and other forms of pollution in Antarctica Monday, arguing for greater global cooperation to help preserve the continent's environmental and scientific research value. The Dry Valley region of Antarctica has seen an increase in visits by tourists. Addressing a joint session of the Arctic Council and the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, Clinton said the Obama administration is concerned about the growing popularity of tourism in the southern polar region. She said the United States is proposing new international limits on the number of landings from tourist vessels, as well as greater cooperation to prevent potentially hazardous discharges from those ships. At the same time, the United States is proposing new requirements for lifeboats on tourist ships ""to make sure they can keep passengers alive until rescue comes,"" Clinton noted. Aside from worrying about the environmental impact of tourism, the U.S. is ""concerned about the safety of the tourists and the suitability of the ships that make the journey south,"" she said.  Watch Clinton say how the Antarctic has been protected from war » . The issue of tourism in the Antarctic has become an increasingly divisive issue in recent years, pitting scientists and preservationists against a travel industry seeking to capitalize on a growing demand for adventure and nature-oriented tours. Over 46,000 tourists visited Antarctica in the 2007-2008 tour season -- almost four times as many visitors as during the 2000-2001 season, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators. Clinton's remarks came as the United States helped mark the 50th anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty, a model for ""how agreements created for one age can serve the world in another,"" Clinton said. Clinton noted that President Obama sent the U.S. Senate an amendment to the treaty Friday that would spell out how the international community should better prevent and respond to environmental emergencies in Antarctica. The amendment would cover the question of liability tied to environmental damage in the ecologically sensitive region. In addition, the United States has proposed an extension of the treaty's marine pollution rules ""in a manner that more accurately reflects the boundaries of the Antarctic ecosystem,"" she noted. ""The treaty is a blueprint for the kind of international cooperation that will be needed more and more to address the challenges of the 21st century,"" Clinton said. ""It is an example of smart power at its best: governments coming together around a common interest and citizens, scientists and institutions from different countries joined in scientific collaboration to advance peace and understanding."" Clinton argued that the treaty ""and its related instruments remain a key tool in our efforts to address an urgent threat of this time: climate change."" A number of international scientific research stations have been established in Antarctica in part to help explore the probable causes and effects of global warming. Twelve nations initially signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959; 47 nations abide by it today. The accord specifies that Antarctic territory cannot be used for military purposes. It bans, among other things, nuclear testing and the disposal of radioactive waste material on the continent. It also protects freedom for international scientific research in the region.",0.6707013,2338
22,"(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. ""I very quickly realized two things,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. ""One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."" ""The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening."" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. ""For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,"" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. ""A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,"" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,"" he said. ""When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. ""The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,"" he said. ""It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet."" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. ""We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,"" he said. ""What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming."" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. ""We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,"" he said. ""We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty."" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. ""Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,"" Schneider said. ""That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that."" E-mail to a friend .",0.67035234,3091
24,"(CNN) -- The world's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment, the World Wildlife Fund said Friday. These two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in Australia. The WWF's latest Living Planet Index shows terrestrial, freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005, with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop. The index is included in a report called ""2010 and Beyond: Rising to the Biodiversity Challenge,"" which the WWF prepared for an international biodiversity conference in Germany later this month. ""No one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines, greater vulnerability to natural disasters, and greater effects from global warming,"" said James Leape, director-general of WWF International. The Living Planet Index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species, which the WWF says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends. Terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period, the WWF said. Marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period, with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005, the WWF said. ""Many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence, and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched,"" the WWF report said. Freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003. The WWF said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet, inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species. In tropical regions, freshwater species were especially hard-hit; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000. The WWF said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003. The causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere, such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems, the WWF said. The dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species' capacity to replace itself, the WWF said. Overfishing is one example. Overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species, according to the report, which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals. Overharvesting of timber is also a major factor, it said. Invasive species, whether introduced deliberately or not, are another threat, especially in freshwater ecosystems, where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species, the WWF said. Pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity, it said. The WWF called on governments attending this month's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010. It wants governments to establish protected areas, particularly those areas important for food security, water supply, medicine, and disaster mitigation, and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020.",0.66868865,682
25,"(CNN) -- A recent scientific expedition in Colombia's mountainous Darien region has unearthed 10 new species of amphibians, an environmental organization said. A new species of salamander was one of the exciting discoveries in Colombia's Darien region. Scientists with Conservation International on Monday announced the discovery of 10 new species in what's being referred to as a safe haven for frogs located in the west of the country on the border with Panama. The discovery of 10 amphibians, which are believed to be new to science, was the result of a three-week survey of the area, the group said. The new species were discovered as part of a CI program aimed at assessing the ecological health of a given area. Scientists identified nearly 60 species of amphibians, 20 reptiles and 120 species of birds, the group said in a prepared statement. The discoveries come as global extinction rates continue to rise. Experts with Conservation International argue that the discovery is particularly significant since amphibians serve as an accurate gauge of an area's ecological health. Amphibians can act as an early warning sign of pollution such as acid rain due to their porous, absorbent skin. The sensitivity of these species to low level environmental threats can also act as a barometer for human health. Conservation International says the discovery offered renewed optimism. ""The high number of new amphibian species found is a sign of hope, even with the serious threat of extinction that this animal group faces in many other regions of the country and the world, "" says Jose Vicente Rodriguez Mahecha, Scientific Director of CI-Colombia, who was part of the team that discovered the new species. The region is, however, not immune to modern threats. According to Conservation International, between 25 percent to 30 percent of the natural vegetation in the Darien area is currently being deforested. For the scientists, the hope now is that the discoveries will renew efforts to conserve the region and manage its rich biodiversity.",0.6679286,1809
26,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- New data released Thursday suggests that the Arctic Ocean will be ""largely ice free"" during summer within a decade. As the Arctic sea ice melts, polar bears face extinction. The report, complied by the UK-based Catlin Arctic Survey and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is the latest research into ice thickness in the Arctic. Researchers predict that within 20 years ice cover will be completely gone during the warmer months. The expedition, which was completed in May, was led by UK explorer Pen Hadow. He and his team collected data by manually drilling into the ice and noting its thickness along a 450-kilometer route across the northern part of the Beaufort Sea. They found that the area surveyed was comprised almost exclusively of first year ice. Scientists think this is significant because traditionally the region has been made up of much older, thicker ice. ""Discovering this area of younger ice provides another body of information that supports the rapidly emerging scientific consensus that it's going to be nearer 10 years from now that we will see roughly 80-85 percent free waters in the Arctic Ocean,"" Hadow told CNN. Measurements taken by Hadow and his team report that the ice-floes were on average 1.8 meters thick -- which, according to scientists, is too thin to survive next summer's ice melt. Professor Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the UK's University of Cambridge said: ""With a large part of the region now first year ice, it is clearly more vulnerable. The area is now more likely to become open water each summer, bringing forward the potential date when the summer sea ice will be completely gone."" Professor Wadhams, who has analyzed the expedition data, added: ""The Catlin Arctic Survey data supports the new consensus view that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer within about 20 years, and much of that decrease will be happening within 10 years.""  Click here to see pictures of the expedition » . Martin Sommerkorn from the WWF International Arctic Program believes that the changes in sea-ice cover in the region are likely to increase global temperatures further. ""Such a loss of Arctic sea ice has recently been assessed to set in motion powerful climate feedbacks which will have an impact far beyond the Arctic itself,"" Sommerkorn said. ""Arctic sea ice holds a central position in our Earth's climate system. Take it out of the equation and we are left with a dramatically warmer world,"" he added. Hadow fears that the current climate models developed by scientists may not be extreme enough. But he is hopeful that this new data will spur world leaders into action. ""We are now in a loss period,"" Hadow told CNN. ""Maybe losing this sea ice, this roof on the top of our planet in going to be an important moment, a big visual aid to the science that in combination can bring about some sort of global agreement on emissions.""",0.6673298,8202

""If you spend money too quickly, you lose site of the long-term vision,"" Chetty told CNN. ""If you focus too much on the long term, you may not act on spending money."" Framing his remarks with an eye on the recession, the president on Monday announced a plan for ""a new energy economy that will build millions of jobs."" Obama proposes to put 460,000 Americans to work through clean energy investments, increasing fuel efficiency in vehicles and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By 2025, the Obama administration hopes one-fourth of the nation's energy will come from renewable sources. Over the long term, the president hopes to create millions of new jobs by investing $150 billion in taxpayer money to help private companies develop new sources of clean energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal power. It's about time, say scientists who often clashed with former President George W. Bush on environmental policy. ""By repowering our nation with clean energy, we will create millions of jobs that can't be sent overseas. By harnessing the energy of the sun and wind, we can refuel our nation and end our addiction to oil,"" said Wesley Warren, director of programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Environmental scholars, however, say the changes Obama seeks are not easy. ""These technologies are not new. They have been around for 10 to 15 years,"" said Bill Chameides, dean of the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University. ""Government can push new policies, but it has to prove to be economically competitive or else it will not happen."" ""It is going to require massive investments,"" said Joseph Romm, former acting assistant secretary of energy under the Clinton administration and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ""The only question is, are we going to be the leader and export our technologies or a follower and continue importing our resources?"" Some economists question whether spending government money on new energy technologies is the best way to stimulate the economy in the short term. Opponents of Obama's proposals say renewable energy would be expensive, take up large amounts of land, and might not even be able to generate sufficient energy given the aging infrastructure of the nation's electric grid. ""If the private sector will not invest in these technologies, it will not be efficient,"" said Alan Reynolds, senior fellow at the Cato Institute. ""Creating jobs by switching from one form of energy to another is a bad idea,"" he added. ""You don't need subsidies for anything that is free. Getting a $7,000 rebate on a $100,000 plug-in electrical hybrid that gets its power from a coal plant doesn't make a lot of sense."" Several events in Washington this week underscored the Obama administration's commitment to environmental issues. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday named a special envoy to pursue global agreements combating global warming. On Wednesday, former Vice President Al Gore urged Congress to approve Obama's stimulus package and said the United States needs to join international talks on a climate-change treaty. ""For years our efforts to address the climate crisis have been undermined by the idea that we must chose between our planet and our way of life, between our moral duty and economic well-being these are false choices,"" Gore told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""In fact, the solutions to the climate crisis are the same solutions that will address our economic and national crisis as well."" Obama may have science on his side. By overwhelming consensus, scientists agree that our warming planet poses a greater global threat with every passing day. The replacement of current technology with energy generated from natural resources, such as sunlight and wind, could help reduce CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency. ""Frankly the science is screaming at us,"" said Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at Wednesday's hearing. ""Carbon dioxide emissions grew at a rate of four times faster in the Bush administration than they did in the 1990s."" Even so, experts agree the faltering economy will complicate any discussion about investment in clean energy. ""The country is running two deficits,"" said David Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics at Oberlin College, ""the economy in the short term, which will take one to five years to figure out [and] the environment in the long term, which if we don't do anything about it will see catastrophic effects.""",0.66605294,4527
28,"(CNN) -- U.S. President George W. Bush told a global climate change conference Friday that the United States will do its part to improve the environment by taking on greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. President George W. Bush Friday tells a global climate change conference ""we take this issue seriously."" ""We take this issue seriously,"" he said at the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change, which the White House sponsored. In his address, Bush called on ""all the world's largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions, including developed and developing nations,"" to come together and ""set a long-term goal for reducing"" greenhouse emissions. ""By setting this goal, we acknowledge there is a problem, and by setting this goal, we commit ourselves to doing something about it,"" he said.  Watch Bush address the climate conference » . ""By next summer, we will convene a meeting of heads of state to finalize the goal and other elements of this approach, including a strong and transparent system for measuring our progress toward meeting the goal we set. ... Only by doing the necessary work this year will it be possible to reach a global consensus at the U.N. in 2009."" Bush said it will be up to each nation to ""design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this long-term goal."" He said new technology, such as clean coal technology and biofuels, could help reduce greenhouse gases. He also called for more use of nuclear, wind and solar power. ""It was said that we faced a choice between protecting the environment and producing enough energy. Today we know better,"" the president said. ""These challenges share a common solution: technology."" ""We must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity for their people,"" he said. ""We know this can be done,"" Bush said. ""Last year, America grew our economy while also reducing greenhouse gases."" If the preliminary numbers stand, it would make 2006 the first time in Bush's presidency that greenhouse emissions dropped. In prepared remarks this week, Assistant Secretary of Energy Karen Harbert said, ""Preliminary data for 2006 suggests an absolute reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of 1.3 percent for that year despite economic growth of 2.9 percent."" In previous years, the administration also has said its policies were reducing greenhouse emissions, but Department of Energy figures through 2005 show emission figures went up each year. The administration also said during those years it was reducing ""greenhouse emissions intensity,"" a term referring to the ratio between emissions and the size of the economy. The administration said the economy was growing at a faster rate than the emissions themselves. While the White House has taken heat for its environmental policies -- including from some Republicans such as Sen. John McCain -- Bush said at the conference Friday, ""By working together, we will set wise and effective policies."" He added, ""I want to get the job done. We have identified a problem -- let's go solve it together."" Other nations have been critical of the Bush administration's policy on climate change after the United States withdrew from the 1997 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol. That protocol, which was signed by more than 150 countries,  called on industrialized nations to cut greenhouse emissions in absolute terms. It did not make that demand of developing nations. The protocol expires in 2012. Representatives of 16 countries, the United Nations and the European Union are attending this week's two-day conference. The Bush administration has billed it as an initiative to develop a common approach to combat global warming following  Kyoto's collapse. At a Group of Eight conference in June, Bush pushed for a new framework on global gas emissions to counter the effects of global warming. Bush said he believes every nation should set its own goals. The president expressed concern that setting strict targets would damage the U.S. economy. Instead, he said, industries should enact voluntary measures. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also told delegates to the global climate change conference that countries around the world must work together to combat climate change, much as they cooperate against terror and the spread of disease. ""No one nation, no matter how much power or political will it possesses, can succeed alone,"" she said. ""We all need partners, and we all need to work in concert."" Rice said the United States takes climate change seriously, ""for we are both a major economy and a major emitter."" In her address to the Major Economies Meeting, Rice said an integrated response, including ""environmental stewardship, economic growth, energy supply and security and development and the development and deployment of new clean energy technology,"" is the key to moving forward on the issue.

29,"Washington (CNN) -- Greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday. ""The overwhelming amount of scientific studies show that the threat is real,"" she said. The announcement stems from a Supreme Court ruling which ordered the agency to determine the impact of carbon emissions not only on the environment, but on public health. iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change . ""These long-overdue findings cement 2009's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution and seizing the opportunity of clean energy reform,"" Jackson said. Immediately after the announcement, Jackson was leaving for Copenhagen, Denmark, to participate in the Copenhagen Climate Conference ahead of President Obama's appearance at the end of the week. Her statement could provide evidence to the conference that the agency and the Obama administration are taking global warming seriously. However, Jackson said that Monday's announcement does not require any immediate regulatory action. The Obama administration is pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions, a so-called ""cap and trade"" policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions. Jackson said carbon dioxide emissions go beyond damaging the environment -- they also endanger public health. The agency made the announcement because it is required to issue an ""endangerment finding"" -- evidence that carbon emissions are dangerous to the public health -- before it can regulate carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA said in April that it would likely make such a ruling regarding carbon emissions and public health. The agency completed a public-comment process before making the announcement.

30,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Global warming could destabilize ""struggling and poor"" countries around the world, prompting mass migrations and creating breeding grounds for terrorists, the chairman of the National Intelligence Council told Congress on Wednesday. Climate change could increase flooding in coastal areas, like the flooding that hit the Philippines. Climate change ""will aggravate existing problems such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership and weak political institutions,"" Thomas Fingar said. ""All of this threatens the domestic stability of a number of African, Asian, Central American and Central Asian countries."" People are likely to flee destabilized countries, and some may turn to terrorism, he said. ""The conditions exacerbated by the effects of climate change could increase the pool of potential recruits into terrorist activity,"" he said. ""Economic refugees will perceive additional reasons to flee their homes because of harsher climates,"" Fingar predicted. That will put pressure on countries receiving refugees, many of which ""will have neither the resources nor interest to host these climate migrants,"" he said in testimony to the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. Reactions to the report broke down along partisan lines, with Democrats generally praising it and Republicans expressing doubts. Committee members had concerns about the report's secrecy, reliability and use of intelligence resources. Global warming may have a slight positive effect on the United States, since it is likely to produce larger farming yields, Fingar said . But it is also likely to result in storm surges that could affect nuclear facilities and oil refineries near coasts, water shortages in the Southwest and longer summers with more wildfires, the study found. International migration may also help spread disease, Fingar added, and climate change could put stress on international trade in essential commodities. ""The United States depends on a smooth-functioning international system ensuring the flow of trade and market access to critical raw materials, such as oil and gas, and security for its allies and partners. Climate change and climate change policies could affect all of these,"" he warned, ""with significant geopolitical consequences."" The report was the conclusion of the most comprehensive government analysis the U.S. intelligence community has ever conducted on climate change. Fingar emphasized that it could make no hard and fast predictions, saying that the operative word in his assessment was ""may."" Wealthy countries will be able to handle the situation better than poorer ones, he said. ""We assess that no country will be immune to the effects of climate change, but some will be able to cope more effectively than others,"" he said. ""Most of the struggling and poor states that will suffer adverse impacts to their potential and economic security are in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Central and Southeast Asia. ""However, the spillover -- from potentially increased migration and water-related disputes -- could have a harmful global impact,"" he added. Fingar painted a mixed picture of the effects of climate change on the United States itself. ""Most studies suggest the United States as a whole will enjoy modest economic benefits over the next few decades, largely due to the increased crop yields,"" he said. ""Costs begin to mount thereafter, however, and some parts of the United States -- particularly built-up coastal areas -- will be at greater risk of extreme weather events and potentially high costs related to losses in complex infrastructure."" The impact of fighting and preparing for climate change may be greater than the effect of global warming itself, Fingar said. ""Government, business and public efforts to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to deal with climate change -- from policies to reduce greenhouse gases to plans to reduce exposure to climate change or capitalize on potential impacts -- may affect U.S. national security interests even more than the physical impacts of climate change itself,"" he said. The report, the ""National Intelligence Assessment on the National Security Implications of Global Climate Change to 2030,"" relied on U.S. government, military, academic and United Nations studies of climate change. The report itself is classified, which some members of the House committee objected to. ""I am disappointed it is classified,"" said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California. Secrecy ""prevents this report from being released and discussed in public domain."" Committee Chairman Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he would ask the administration to declassify it. Markey opened the hearing by saying ""human beings all over the planet face death or damage or injury if we do not act."" He blasted the White House stance on climate change, saying, ""The Bush administration continues to limit what their experts know. The president doesn't want America to know the real risk of global warming."" Republicans on the committee criticized the report as wasteful, with Rep. Darrell Issa of California calling it a ""dangerous diversion of intelligence resources."" Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, said that the report was unreliable and that its authors admitted as much. ""We have a lot of information where we are incapable of assessing it,"" Fingar conceded. Hoekstra also questioned the committee's priorities. ""There are a lot more pressing issues out there for the intelligence community to be focused on right now that would help keep America safe,"" he said. The assessment ""was a waste of time, a waste of resources for the intelligence community to be focused on this issue versus other folks in the government that could have done this job and have a responsibility for doing it."" Fingar said the intelligence community had relied on the science of others because it did not itself monitor climate change. He said the assessment was based on midrange predictions of global warming.",0.6637063,4036
31,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Climate change is happening faster than previously predicted according to a new World Wildlife Fund report. The WWF say climate change threat has worsened in the 15 months since the IPCC last reported. Bringing together some of the most recent scientific reports and data, ""Climate change: faster, stronger, sooner"" reveals that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than the predictions made in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007. One of the most concerning aspects of recent data is evidence that, in some places, the Arctic Ocean is losing sea ice 30 years ahead of current IPCC predictions. Summer sea ice is now forecasted to completely disappear in the summer months sometime between 2013 and 2040 -- something which hasn't happened for over a million years. The report's author, geoscientist Dr Tina Tin told CNN: ""Arctic sea ice is melting much faster than everybody had been expecting. Why? Well, maybe it's because the positive feedback mechanisms have kicked in much quicker than we have been able to quantify."" Positive feedback mechanisms amplify changes occurring in the climate. In the case of the Arctic region there is a sort of vicious circle of warming occurring. White ice sheets perform an important function in moderating global temperature by reflecting heat from the sun back into space. But they have begun to melt as the earth has warmed. The result is more dark sea water which absorbs heat, which in turn warms the earth more and encourages further melting. Globally, sea levels are now expected to rise more than double the IPCC's most recent forecast of 0.59 meters before the end of the century. This will put millions of people in coastal regions at risk. World food production is also feeling the heat as yields of wheat, maize and barley had dwindled in recent months. In Europe, ecosystems in the North and Baltic Sea are believed to be experiencing their warmest temperatures since records began. And the Mediterranean is likely to experience an increased frequency of droughts. The WWF report also highlights a 2007 study conducted by the British Antarctic Survey. ""Widespread acceleration of tidewater glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula"" concluded that floating tide-water glaciers on the peninsula are losing ice faster and making a greater contribution to global sea level rise than was previously thought. Earlier this month, the WWF highlighted the impact that global warming is likely to have on Antarctic penguin colonies. According to Dr Tin, more Antarctic data is due to be published next year when the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research publish their findings. Scheduled for release in spring 2009 the ""Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment"" is expected to reveal more evidence of damaging climate effects on the continent. While Dr Tin says that it is true that parts of the Antarctic are not warming or perhaps even cooling, the Western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced some of the most rapid increases in warming. ""Over the past 50 years, it has warmed more than four times faster than the average rate of Earth's overall warming,"" Dr Tin said. But Dr Tin remains unsure whether this most recent climate data represents the beginning of a tipping point. ""We think there are possibly tipping points ahead and some scientists, in terms of the Arctic sea ice, think we have probably gone past the tipping point. But it's very difficult to get a strong handle on,"" she said. Nevertheless, she describes her report as a ""sobering overview"" which ""comes at a critical time during the political negotiations of the European Union's climate and energy package"". Newly elected Vice Chair of the IPCC and climate scientist, Jean-Pascal van Ypersele endorsed the WWF publication. ""It is clear that climate change is already having a greater impact than most scientists had anticipated, so it's vital that international mitigation and adaptation responses become swifter and more ambitious,"" van Ypersele said.",0.6624677,7445
32,"(CNN) -- The Irrawaddy, one of the world's rarest species of freshwater dolphins, have been found in surprisingly large numbers deep in the waterlogged jungles of Bangladesh. The Irrawaddy is considered to be one of the world's rarest species of freshwater dolphin. Conservationists thought the Irrawaddy had dwindled in number to just a few hundred, but they have now counted almost 6,000 of them in the Sundarban mangrove forests and the adjacent waters of the Bay of Bengal. The forests of the Sundarban -- Bengali for ""beautiful forest"" -- lie at the delta of the Ganges and two other rivers on the Bay of Bengal. Until now, little mammal research had taken place in the area. ""Every time we had done a study to look into the population (elsewhere), they came out critically endangered,"" said Brian Smith of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, who led the study. ""It was a very pleasant surprise and a shock to find that Bangladesh supports such a large number (of dolphins)."" The discovery is noteworthy because scientists do not know how many Irrawaddy dolphins remain. The next step, they say, is to ensure the mammal's survival. One rare dolphin species -- the Yangtze River dolphin, or baiji -- is extinct. Another, the Ganges River dolphin, is critically endangered. Some of the threats affecting the Irrawaddy are man-made. The construction of dams has reduced the flow of fresh water in many parts of Bangladesh. And the population is dwindling because the dolphins sometimes get caught in fishermen's nets. The dolphin, which has a large, rounded head, can grow up to 8 feet in length and is related to the orca, or killer whale. It is found in large rivers, estuaries and freshwater lagoons in south and southeast Asia. In Myanmar, the dolphins help herd schools of fish toward fishermen's boats and nets. In Bangladesh, fishermen hold them in high regard, Smith said. ""There is no market for dolphin products,"" he said. ""In a country like Bangladesh, with protein deficiency and where food is scarce, there is a real cultural prohibition against harming them. It gives us hope because it means fishermen are very receptive to working with us."" The results of the study were shared Wednesday at a conference for marine mammal protected areas in Hawaii, and published in the winter issue of the Journal of Cetacean Research and Management. Conservationists are now working with the Bangladesh government to establish a protected area for the dolphins. ""There are so many bad news (stories) coming out of the conservation community that this is a real sort of positive story,"" Smith said.",0.66166073,4396
33,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Global warming concerns took center stage Monday as two organizations held rallies to draw attention to an issue that President Barack Obama has promised to place near the top of his agenda. Demonstrators stand outside the Capitol Power Plant in Washington on Monday to protest the plant's use of coal. A group of young protesters gathered in front of the Capitol to rally on behalf of legislation to reduce carbon emissions, decrease dependence on coal and oil, and speed a national drive toward ""clean"" energy. Later Monday, hundreds of representatives of a coalition of environmental, public health, social justice and other advocacy organizations marched around Capitol Hill and encircled a Washington coal-fired power plant to highlight the issue of climate change. The group, protesting the Capitol Power Plant's use of coal, stood in front of the plant's gated entrances. The plant powers the heating and cooling systems in the Capitol, as well as roughly a dozen other federal office buildings on Capitol Hill. ""The Capitol Power Plant, sitting just blocks from Capitol Hill, symbolizes the stranglehold coal has over our government and future,"" the group said on its Web site. ""It's not the largest or the dirtiest power plant in the country, but as the plant that is actually run by and for Congress it serves as an incredibly iconic symbol of what is wrong with our country's energy and climate policy."" No arrests were made as a result of the protest, which ""didn't affect the operations of the power plant,"" Capitol police Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released a letter Thursday calling for the plant to convert to 100 percent natural gas by the end of 2009. ""Taking this major step toward cleaning up the Capitol Power Plant's emissions would be an important demonstration of Congress' willingness to deal with the enormous challenges of global warming, energy independence and our inefficient use of finite fossil fuels,"" they wrote. Several members of Congress and environmental leaders addressed the earlier rally, which was held at the conclusion to Power Shift '09, a four-day environmental summit organized by the Energy Action Coalition. The coalition describes itself as an umbrella organization of 700 groups fighting for ""clean energy solutions and the creation of a new green economy.""

34,"(CNN) -- Robert Swan's life reads like a boy's own adventure tale with a modern eco-twist. Robert Swan was the first man to walk to both the North and South Poles. Inspired by the daring age of Antarctic exploration, Swan followed in the footsteps of his heroes; the men who risked, and lost, their lives to reach the South Pole. At the age of 29 he embarked on an expedition to the South Pole that was unsupported -- a trek that required him to pull his own sleigh and that lacked medical support crews. By the time he was 33 he had become the first man to walk to both the North and South poles unsupported. But for Swan, the epic journeys to the Poles, and the sailing and overland adventures that have followed, unearthed more than just a spirit for adventure. He experienced firsthand the impact of humanity on the environment when under the hole in the ozone layer at the South Pole, the harsh ultraviolet rays from the sun burned his skin and permanently changed the color of his eyes. It firmed a desire to preserve the fragile natural world and to educate and inspire others, particularly the next generation of decision-makers to do the same. ""As the last unspoiled wilderness on Earth, Antarctica is currently protected by the treaty prohibiting drilling and mining until 2041. Decisions made by today's youth will impact our entire planet's ecosystem and the future of life on earth,"" he says on 2041.com. His polar icewalks gained international attention and in 1992 he was asked to speak at the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, later gaining an OBE and being appointed Special Envoy to the Director General of UNESCO in recognition of his work. At the Earth Summit in Rio he committed to a ""global mission"" to remove 1,500 tons of waste from Antarctica. Swan and a team of young people from across the world were successful in cleaning up the Russian Antarctic base of Bellinghausen by 2000, making it inhabitable for wildlife again. Foresight, planning and determination then are not alien to a man who spent five years sourcing the funding for his first Antarctic expedition, and Swan's latest project is taking an even longer-term view. Swan founded his organization ""2041"" in 2003 in order to further his mission of action and education. Named after the year in which Antarctica's protection against mineral exploitation ends, Swan regularly takes business people, teachers and students on expeditions to Antarctica to impress on those with the capacity to enact change that preservation of the environment is essential and achievable. Continuing the green mission on the continent by minimizing the human footprint in the region, his international teams have helped design and build the world's first education station in Antarctica that is run solely on renewable energy. Add to the expeditions, ocean voyages on a boat with sails made from recycled plastic bottles, and it's clear that the veteran polar explorer is a man who is doing all he can to protect and preserve the Antarctic.",0.6593034,5179
35,"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) -- A loud crack echoes throughout the canopy as two young orangutans come tumbling down, grasping at branches along the way to break their fall. They recover and sheepishly scamper back up. This is lesson one of jungle school here in the forests of central Sumatra, one of the few places where orangutans are being successfully rehabilitated into the wild. ""They have to learn that their whole environment is completely different from the cage,"" says Peter Pratje of the Frankfurt Zoological Society. ""They have to learn that branches and small trees -- the size of bars in the cage -- don't carry them any longer. They bend and break."" ""During the first phase of this jungle training, they are very often falling out of the trees because they use rotten branches."" The two youngsters swing awkwardly between the trees. On the ground below, their trainers keep a watchful eye and try to coax them toward fruit trees. Learning to forage is another crucial lesson in survival. Back in the massive enclosure, the orangutans undergo enrichment exercises to keep their minds occupied and prolong their feeding time. Success here is critical. Scientists say the Sumatran orangutan will be the first great ape to go extinct. ""The orangutan is an extremely vulnerable species because they have a very slow breeding cycle. Usually an orangutan stays for around 7 to 9 years with its mother,"" Pratje says. ""Besides natural mortality, if there is only a little increase in mortality over a longer time already it drives an orangutan population to extinction."" The numbers of Sumatran orangutans have already dwindled to around  6,000. The main reason for that is habitat destruction. Sumatra has lost 85 percent of its natural forest, mainly due to palm oil and pulp and paper companies, scientists say. The sanctuary, a Frankfurt Zoological Project, is just outside the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park. The lowlands surrounding it are an ideal habitat for orangutans, and it's where those that have been released are choosing to build their habitats. According to the environmental group WWF, it's also home to the endangered Sumatran elephant and a quarter of the critically endangered Sumatran tigers left in the wild. But the area, which is not currently protected, is being threatened by pulp and paper companies that want to see the region turned into plantations. So far the government has rejected logging permits, but unless this is declared a conservation area, Pratje and other conservationists fear that could change. So far, more than 100 orangutans have been released here, with just over a dozen more in various stages of training. Pratje has lived here since he established the sanctuary seven years ago, dedicating his entire life to this project. ""It's like fighting for a member of my family,"" he says. ""I love them because they are smart, smarter than other great apes."" But he says the fight is not just about the extinction of a species. The orangutan has become the ambassador for the threatened rainforest. ""If we sacrifice these forests, we may sacrifice our chances for getting medicine for important diseases,"" he says. ""The problem is there is no second chance. If you shut down an ecosystem that is hundreds of years old, you can't regrow it any longer. ""So this is the last chance.""",0.6591794,8633

An elephant seal with a custom-designed electronic tag. The tags fell off when the animals molted. The fourth IPY, which began in March 2007 and actually covered two full years, ended last month, after 160 scientific projects were undertaken by researchers from over 60 countries. A joint project by the International Council for Science (ICSW) and World Meteorological Organization. (WMO), the IPY hoped to spearhead efforts to better monitor and understand the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The project had international funding of about US$ 1.2 billion over the two-year period. ""The International Polar Year 2007/2008 came at a crossroads for the planet's future,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of WMO in a press statement. ""The new evidence resulting from polar research will strengthen the scientific basis on which we build future actions."" Researchers found that in the Arctic during the summers of 2007 and 2008, the minimum extent of year-round sea ice decreased to its lowest level since satellite records began 30 years ago. According to a report published by the IPY organizing committee in February, their research indicates that global warming is affecting Antarctica in ways not previously identified. Other evidence of climate change came from IPY research vessels that found warming waters in the Southern Ocean and an increase in melting ice that is creating fresher bottom water around the coast of Antarctica. Among efforts to study the effects of climate change on Antarctica, was aNorwegian Polar Institute project to study marine mammals. Custom-designed tags were attached to elephant seals to study the animals' habits, although researcher realized the tags could also help with field research on climate change. The electronic tags -- which fell off when the seals molted -- sent back data on temperature and salinity the oceans around Antarctica, particularly around the Fimbul Ice Shelf in east Antarctica. While ice-shelf melt has been recorded in the west of Antarctica, scientists are concerned that it could happen in the east as well. Another project to study the underside of an Antarctic glacier deployed an autonomous robot submarine. The team from the U.S. and British Antarctic Survey sent the ""Autosub"" on six missions to study the Pine Island Glacier and how changes in ocean temperature were affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Using sonar, the submarine picked its way around the glacier and sent back data that created three-dimensional maps that scientists used to determine where and how the warmth of the ocean waters was melting the glacier's base. ""If [the West Antarctic Ice Sheet] were to melt completely, global sea levels would rise by as much as 5 meters,"" said Stan Jacobs, the U.S. lead scientist on the project. ""Because so little is known about ice-sheet behavior, this research will take us a step further in understanding how ice sheets will contribute to sea-level rise.""",0.6587297,2529
37,"(CNN) -- Ancient man may have started global warming through massive deforestation and burning that could have permanently altered the Earth's climate, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Virginia and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. Primitive slash-and-burn agriculture permanently changed Earth's climate, according to a new study. The study, published in the scientific journal Quaternary Science Reviews and reported on the University of Virginia's Web site, says over thousands of years, farmers burned down so many forests on such a large scale that huge amounts of carbon dioxide were pumped into the atmosphere. That possibly caused the Earth to warm up and forever changed the climate. Lead study author William Ruddiman is a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a climate scientist. ""It seems like a common-sense idea that there weren't enough people around 5, 6, 7,000 years ago to have any significant impact on climate. But if you allow for the fact that those people, person by person, had something like 10 times as much of an effect or cleared 10 times as much land as people do today on average, that bumps up the effect of those earlier farmers considerably, and it does make them a factor in contributing to the rise of greenhouse gasses,"" Ruddiman said. Ruddiman said that starting thousands of years ago, people would burn down a forest, poke a hole in the soil between the stumps, drop seeds in the holes and grow a crop on that land until the nutrients were tapped out of the soil. Then they would move on. ""And they'd burn down another patch of forest and another and another. They might do that five times in a 20-year period,"" he said. That slashing and burning on such a large scale spewed enormous amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere and warmed the planet, the study says. Ruddiman has studied and researched the idea of ancient man contributing to climate change for years now. And he's endured plenty of criticism over his theories. Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology in Stanford, California, is among those who disagree with Ruddiman. He said Ruddiman is ""exaggerating the importance of early man."" Caldeira told CNN that while ancient farmers may have played a tiny role in climate change, ""it just wasn't a significant factor."" He added, ""There are actually studies showing if you cut down forests for farmland, you actually cool the planet, because of the glare from the cleared land."" Ruddiman and study co-author Erle Ellis, an ecologist with UMBC, acknowledge that some models of past land use show it's only been in the past 150 years -- with a huge population explosion, the onset of the Industrial Age and the rise of fossil-fuel burning -- that global warming has accelerated. But Ruddiman said, ""My argument is that even at the beginning, they just used much more land per person, so even though there weren't that many people, they used enough to start to push these greenhouse gas concentrations up."" Ruddiman's research also argues that the Earth was on its way to another ice age 10,000 years ago and that ice sheets were already forming in northern latitudes when ancient man started his slashing and burning method of farming.",0.65775603,5709
38,"(CNN) -- Researchers have discovered a previously unknown group of rare monkeys in the forests of Vietnam. The Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys were so skittish, researchers captured a photo of only one: an adult male. Several biologists caught fleeting glimpses of about 15 or 20 Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys in a remote area near the Chinese frontier, the wildlife conservation group Fauna & Flora International said Thursday. The ""bizarre-looking"" monkeys -- on the brink of extinction -- were so skittish around people that researchers were able to snap a photo of just one of them: an adult male scampering through the trees. The monkeys were ""very sensitive to the presence of people, giving warning signs to one another and fleeing"" whenever biologists approached, the group said in a statement. ""It was apparent that the monkeys associated humans with danger -- perhaps due to ongoing threats from hunters,"" the group said. So few Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys have survived in the wild that scientists thought until recently that they were extinct. Now they estimate that roughly 200 remain, mainly in parts of northern Vietnam near the Chinese border. Hunters with a taste for bush meat and the loss of habitat have pushed the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey toward extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It classifies the primate as critically endangered ""because its population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 mature individuals, and it is experiencing a continuing decline."" Fauna & Flora said it is working with a variety of groups to improve the livelihoods and ""reduce human pressures on the forest ecosystem"" in an effort to safeguard the newly discovered group, which was spotted in a patch of forest in the Quan Ba district of Vietnam's Ha Giang province. The sighting thrilled conservation biologist Le Khac Quyet, described by Fauna & Flora as ""one of the few people in the world who can claim to be an expert on this mysterious species"" and as the person credited with discovering the new group of that species. ""When I saw the Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys ... I was overjoyed,"" he said in the Fauna & Flora statement. ""There is still time to save this unique species, but with just 200 or so left and threats still strong, we need to act now.""",0.6572878,4295
39,"Dutch Harbor, ALASKA (CNN) -- In Dutch Harbor the smell of fish wafting from the docks and the canneries is the smell of money. And lately, the town has smelled a lot less fishy. High seas high jinx: Tobias gives his shipmate Hanns a haircut at sea using a sail bag as a barber cape. Over fishing, new quota systems and changes in expected weather patterns have all played a role in changing the face of this once swashbuckling Alaskan town, fishermen say. ""Last summer we thought that pollock fishing was over for good, it was so bad. Time to turn out the lights and go home. But then they cut the quotas by 30 percent and now there are some small signs of more small fish, so maybe they are coming back,"" said Guy Collins, who coordinates with fishing captains who unload their catch at the Unisea docks in Dutch Harbor. ""The fishermen have to go further north toward Russia now to get the fish that are near the ice. It used to be the boats would go out 100 miles, now they go out 500. It could be partly due to temperature change and weather patterns."" Dutch Harbor saw a revival in popularity with the reality show The Deadliest Catch, but even the high-fiving enthusiasm of the deck hands on the TV show can't match what the town was like in the glory days. ""Those were the days, in the mid 1980's, there was booze, drugs and partying. You had lines of coke going down the bar and no one said anything,"" says Byron Singley, captain of the 24-ton fishing boat the Nancy Allen. ""People were making big money and spending it as fast as it came in. I earned $78,000 as a deckhand the first year I was here but I can't remember where it went. Those days are long gone."" Aboard the Silent Sound, as we sail north through the Bering Sea, we're finding other things are not quite like they used to be. For starters, we've been becalmed for much of the trip when we were expecting to encounter strong winds on the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. We have motored nearly half of our 2,300 miles so far. More importantly, the ice we were bracing ourselves for may not be where we expected to find it. While this is good news for the expedition from a sailing perspective, it's less attractive for wildlife such as polar bears, seals and walruses that use the ice as a platform for hunting, mating and migration. ""The present extent of northern sea ice is very similar to the extents at this time in 2008 and in 2007. It is close to values seen also in 1995 and 1990. It is about five per cent below the long-term average of 12.2m square kilometers,"" said Dr Humfrey Melling, a research scientist with the Institute of Ocean Sciences near Victoria, British Columbia. September 2007 was the first time that the Northwest Passage was open water from end to end. An ice forecast issued by the Canadian Ice Service on July 1 showed earlier than normal break up in many key areas in the Western Arctic. ""In the Western Arctic region, the breakup pattern is one to three weeks early in many coastal areas and by as much as one month in isolated areas,"" the report said. But we're still some 400 miles from the Arctic Circle and a month from entering the heart of the Northwest Passage, which gives the Arctic plenty of time to surprise us.",0.65661234,6305
40,"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- U.S. President-elect Barack Obama announced key members of his energy team on Monday, naming physicist Steven Chu as secretary of energy, and former EPA administrator Carol Browner to a new post in the White House to coordinate energy and climate policy. Carol Browner was one of four key environmental nominees named by Obama. Obama also named Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, to serve as his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for energy and environment, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Sutley, a prominent supporter of Sen. Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, is the first high-ranking gay appointee to the Obama administration. ""In the 21st century, we know that the future of our economy and national security is inextricably linked with one challenge: energy,"" Obama said at a news conference to introduce his energy team. ""We've seen Washington launch policy after policy, yet our dependence on foreign oil has only grown, even as the world's resources are disappearing,"" he said. ""This time has to be different. This time we cannot fail, nor can we be lulled into complacency simply because the price at the pump has for now gone down from $4 a gallon."" Obama called Chu ""uniquely suited to be our next secretary of energy"" for his work on new and cleaner forms of energy. Chu, who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, won the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics and is highly respected in energy circles. Browner, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, was named to be the nation's first ""climate czar,"" working inside the White House on policy issues. ""Carol understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security, and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies, cooperation between federal, state, and local governments and partnership with the private sector,"" Obama said. He said that Jackson, as commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, helped make that state a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing new sources of energy. ""Lisa also shares my commitment to restoring the EPA's robust role in protecting our air, our water, and abundant natural resources so that our environment is cleaner and our communities are safer,"" Obama said. Sutley has been ""at the cutting edge"" of environmental work on the municipal and regional level, Obama said. She will be ""a key player in helping to make our government more efficient in coordinating our efforts to protect our environment at home and around the globe,"" he added. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa praised the appointment of his deputy mayor to a national post. ""With Nancy on my team, we have made tremendous progress -- from quadrupling our renewable energy portfolio to exceeding the targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol four years ahead of schedule,"" he said in a written statement. Energy is one aspect of the president-elect's goal to create 2.5 million jobs by 2011. The plan aims to put Americans to work updating the country's infrastructure, making public buildings more energy-efficient and implementing environmentally friendly technologies, including alternative energy sources. During his campaign, Obama said he would invest $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy. He proposed increasing fuel economy standards and requiring that 10 percent of electricity in the United States comes from renewable sources by 2012.",0.6563677,5340
41,"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- The tragic death of a trainer at Sea World last week revived a number of long simmering questions. While we still grapple with ""how did this happen?"" the central question for many revolves around the role of large mammals -- like Tilikum the killer whale -- in zoos and aquariums: Should they be there or not? Animals in zoos, aquariums and museums play an important and powerful part in our cultural and formal educational processes. Humans are inherently interested in nature. We are not very far removed from a time when being knowledgeable about nature was vital to life; you either knew how to find your dinner or you were dinner. Today, with well over 50 percent of our populations living in cities, we are rapidly becoming divorced from the realities of the animal world. The dialogue we see in the media, read on blogs and hear in conversation makes it clear that many people have lots of ideas about what's happening in our natural world, much of it not correct. This lack of knowledge is concerning in a world beset by environmental problems, where species are disappearing at an alarming rate. We need people to understand the changes taking place in our natural systems and appreciate that each of our actions has an impact. More interest and knowledge, not less, is essential. Zoos and aquariums provide access and a vital connection to the world of wildlife and our environment, helping to foster an understanding of nature and how it works, and an appreciation for why it matters. Most professionally operated zoos and aquariums, such as those accredited by the Canadian or American Associations of Zoos and Aquariums, are dedicated to increasing engagement and raising awareness and participation in conservation issues. They conduct active programs that aid species survival, research and conservation, both at their public display facilities and in the field. The Vancouver Aquarium has operated our Marine Mammal Rescue (MMR) program since the mid 1960s. Each year, hundreds of marine mammals are rescued from situations of distress and rehabilitated by our dedicated team of staff and volunteers, led by our veterinarian. Their goal is to return marine mammals to good health so they can be released back to the ocean. The Vancouver Aquarium has not had killer whales on exhibit since 2001. However, our orca research continues in the field with experts working off the British Columbia coast to observe and study social interaction, behaviors, migrations, and feeding patterns. We do have beluga whales, including two calves born recently. Belugas are ideally suited to an aquarium environment. The calves' births have allowed researchers to study the social structure of a beluga family, and in collaboration with the University of British Columbia we have conducted beluga vocalization studies since 2002 to understand contact calls and other forms of communication between these beautiful and communicative animals. As our visitors see beluga whales and learn about their communication, natural history and the challenges they face due to climate change in the Arctic, a unique chain is created, moving from initial amazement of observing these creatures to the inspiration to care about them and finally to take action, in large or small ways, to protect their future by conserving their natural environment. We see our role as more important now than ever before. The time of simply displaying animals merely as curiosities is, thankfully, over. Our aquarium, and many others like it, represents often the only -- and the best -- opportunity for urbanites (particularly youth) to establish a connection with the natural world of animals. Sadly, many of us will never experience the joy and wonder of encountering animals in their natural habitat. But can get learn about them up close and personal in a modern and reputable aquarium or zoo. If you have had the good fortune to spend time in such an institution, and have seen the sense of awe and wonder on the faces of youngsters meeting a sea otter, for example, for the first time, you'll know what this is all about. What's more, having access to, and learning about, Tilikum and other whales in aquariums and marine parks since such amazing creatures were first displayed in the mid-1960s, has totally changed people's perceptions about them. Before then, killer whales were feared, termed ""wolves of the sea"", and even had a bounty on their heads in some places; being able to see them personally helped spark people's curiosity and interest. The resulting change in public perception was dramatic and swift, leading to their protection by the U.S. government in the 1970s under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Today, most people revere killer whales and understand a great deal more about the challenges this species faces around the world -- with overfishing depleting their food supply, the impacts of climate change and pollution threatening their environment and their ultimate survival. With so many changes confronting nature and the animals that make it their home, human understanding and appreciation is critical. Animals that people are privileged to see in professional zoos, aquariums and similar institutions are vital to engagement, inspiration and conservation.

42,"(CNN) -- Those battling global warming by promoting biofuels may unintentionally be adding to skyrocketing world food prices, creating what one expert calls ""a silent tsunami"" in developing nations. The rising prices are ""threatening to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger,"" Josette Sheeran, executive director of the United Nations' World Food Program, said on the agency's Web site Tuesday. Sheeran is one of the experts attending a Food summit hosted Tuesday by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, aimed at determining ways to boost food supplies and identify deterrents. Also attending the meeting are scientists and representatives from the European Union and Africa. On the Web site, Sheeran said the increase in food prices is ""a silent tsunami that respects no borders."" ""The world's misery index is rising ... as soaring food and fuel prices roll through the lives of the most vulnerable,"" she said Friday. The crisis is forcing the organization to look for cuts in aid to some of its recipients, she said. Soaring food prices have triggered violence in some developing countries, and biofuels are bearing at least part of the blame. Producing fuel from plant crops is supposed to be greener than drilling for oil, and biofuels generally burn cleaner, too. But the global biofuels industry now stands accused of a list of side effects that are said to be damaging lives, especially of the world's poorest people. ""The drive for more biofuels means more investment is going into those crops, meaning less land and less investment going in for food crops, causing a massive conflict and resulting in rising prices, which is having a huge negative impact, especially on developing countries,"" said Clare Oxborrow, food campaigner for Friends of the Earth.  See why tortilla makers are blaming biofuel for increasing food prices » . Critics also say that in Africa, Asia and South America, people are being driven from their land and forests are being cleared to make room for the booming biofuel industry. The International Food Policy Research Institute says the use of cereals for industrial purposes like making biofuels has risen by a quarter since 2000. Brown said in an article posted on the 10 Downing Street Web site, ""We now know that biofuels intended to promote energy independence and combat climate change are frequently energy-inefficient. ""We need to look closely at the impact on food prices and the environment of different production methods and to ensure we are more selective in our support. If our UK review shows that we need to change our approach, we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets,"" he said. ""We must also do more to explore the links between climate change and food, and particularly their impact on the livelihoods and vulnerability of the very poorest, who are likely to be most affected by climate change."" The meeting he convened, Brown said, is a precursor to the G8 summit of industrial nations, to be held in July, and a special U.N. summit in September. He urged prompt action. ""With one child dying every five seconds from hunger-related causes, the time to act is now,"" Brown stressed. The World Health Organization views hunger as the No. 1 threat to public health around the world, responsible for a third of child deaths and 10 percent of all disease. Douglas Alexander, Britain's International Development secretary, announced Tuesday that Britain has set aside a 455 million-pound [$900 million] aid package to address the food crisis.

43,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The world's tropical forests are disappearing, and one reason is simple economics: People, companies and governments earn more by logging, mining or farming places such as the Amazon jungle than by conserving them. Global climate change treaty, scheduled for completion in December, is designed to protect tropical forests. Efforts to halt rain forest destruction date back decades, but they so far have failed to tackle the issue on a scale commensurate with the challenge. Now there may be a remedy, and the reason is climate change. Increased awareness of the threat from global warming has prompted unprecedented international focus on how to combat it, as well as new appreciation for the vital role of tropical forests in the climate change equation. On Tuesday, world leaders gather at the United Nations for a special climate change summit, intended to build momentum for a new global climate change treaty being negotiated by almost 200 countries. The new treaty is scheduled to be completed in December in Copenhagen, Denmark. If eventually enacted, the treaty will include a revolutionary but little-known provision intended to protect remaining tropical forests. Known as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries, or REDD, the provision is based on the knowledge that destroying tropical forests contributes to global warming. Rain forests absorb and store huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Burning or clearing the forests returns that stored CO2 to the atmosphere, where it can trap heat and gradually increase temperatures. Every year, tropical forests equal to an area the size of England are destroyed, contributing about 20 percent of total annual greenhouse gas emissions -- more than all the world's cars, trucks and airplanes combined. The idea of the proposed provision is to make the stored carbon dioxide in the forests a commodity that can be bought and sold on the global market. Polluters in the developing world would be able to offset their emissions by buying credits for stored forest carbon dioxide. The money from those purchases would go to developing world governments, international organizations, local communities and others involved in forest protection programs. For the first time, tropical forests would be worth money for simply existing. That could create an economic incentive to protect tropical forests, which also have biological value as the planet's richest storehouses of land species and spiritual worth as pristine natural landscapes. To longtime defenders of tropical forests, the proposal represents the final stage of a long and halting journey from the fringes of the environmental movement toward the mainstream of international policy. ""Done properly, this is our No. 1 hope,"" said Randall Hayes, who founded the Rainforest Action Network in 1985 with the goal of halting tropical deforestation. ""Other strategies have been heroic but insufficient."" The system would let nations and industries that are the biggest greenhouse-gas emitters buy carbon credits in tropical forests in South and Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia and other equatorial regions. At the same time, investors could speculate on the price of carbon dioxide through credit trading. Private and public funds could invest in projects that protect forests to generate credits. Final details of the plan remain uncertain, such as how forest carbon credits would be verified and how the money paid for them would be handled and distributed. For developing countries, the idea represents a potential new revenue source. President Bharrat Jagdeo of Guyana, a leading proponent of the plan, has made trading carbon credits a central element of his Low-Carbon Development Strategy. The strategy ""is more about development than about the environment and it will help us to accelerate infrastructural development and fill the budget gap,"" Jagdeo said in an August 29 speech. The World Bank and partners have set up funds to help developing countries prepare for REDD and finance forest-protection initiatives. However, both funds are not fully capitalized, pending the successful conclusion of negotiations on the new global climate change treaty. ""Right now everybody is in a wait-and-see mode,"" said Benoit Bosquet, the World Bank's lead carbon finance specialist. ""Everybody seems interested, but the level of activity is still humble."" Conservationists cite the environmental benefits of saving tropical forests, which provide essential resources and services -- such as fresh water, food, flood control and many others -- on which more than a billion people depend. Now, they say, conserving forests also can contribute to sustainable development, benefiting both nature and people. Yet several steps remain before the tropical-forest provision becomes reality on a large scale. First, the U.N.-led negotiations must agree on a treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol -- the world's first global climate change agreement, which expires in 2012. The Kyoto treaty created a global carbon market -- but only the carbon storage of newly planted or replanted forests is eligible for credits. REDD also would protect standing forests, to prevent the absorbed carbon dioxide stocks from being released back into the atmosphere. Whether a new treaty will be completed in December is unclear. Negotiators have yet to set consensus targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and major disputes remain between industrialized powers such as the United States and emerging and developing economies including China and Brazil. The draft under negotiation includes REDD, but negotiations continue on how broad the policy would be. Advocates of a limited scope for REDD say areas with no history of deforestation should be excluded because protecting them won't reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In response, conservationists and developing nations warn against leaving out nations and regions -- including Jagdeo's Guyana, parts of Indonesia and Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo and others -- that still have much of their tropical forest intact. They argue that halting deforestation in only some countries would cause the loggers, palm oil developers and other drivers of forest destruction to move to previously untargeted areas. ""If REDD mechanisms exclude any significant group of countries, REDD will fail,"" Jagdeo told U.N. negotiators in December. Critics, including some environmental groups, question how such a vast and complex system can be successfully implemented. A Greenpeace report issued in March said including REDD credits in carbon markets would create a glut and drastically cut the price of carbon, resulting in industrial polluters buying cheap credits for offsets instead of reducing their emissions. The report also warned of reduced investments in renewable energy technologies due to the lack of an incentive from the cheaper carbon credits. Others question whether REDD will be another scheme generated by industrialized nations to exploit resources of the developing world, and in particular, the indigenous forest peoples. Jagdeo, the president of Guyana, has said such critics should recognize the opportunity that a new climate change treaty could present. If it includes sufficiently robust commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he argues, that would create a strong demand for carbon credits. The deforestation provision of a climate change treaty could help stem deforestation while providing ""badly needed capital flows to some of the poorest countries in the world,"" he said. Yet even the idea's most ardent supporters recognize that it could take years for a global-scale program to become effective. While local projects exist in rain forest countries such as Madagascar, it would take time and money to expand them. ""If there is a deal in Copenhagen and if there is a signaling by industrialized nations that, yes, they will make money available, then you will see developing countries scaling up their readiness,"" said the World Bank's Bosquet. ""They will see that this is now real and it's the time to react.""",0.6511127,7308
44,"(CNN) -- The world has a new alliance to save vanishing frogs, toads and salamanders. A frog swims in a pond in Munich, Germany, in June. A coalition of organizations established the Amphibian Survival Alliance this month to conserve species threatened by deadly fungus, habitat loss, pollution, pesticides and climate change. The scientists said amphibians are the world's most threatened group of animals. Though they thrived on Earth for more than 360 million years, one in three of the 6,000 recognized amphibian species are now at risk of extinction and as many as 122 species have gone extinct since 1980, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's amphibian specialist group. ""The world's amphibians are facing an uphill battle for survival,"" said James Collins of Arizona State University, co-chairman of the group. He said the new alliance, formed at the Amphibian Mini Summit at the Zoological Society of London, will focus efforts on the biggest threat to amphibians: infectious disease and habitat destruction. The group includes amphibian specialists working in the wild as well as those in zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens worldwide. ""Amphibians have so much to offer humans,"" said amphibian specialist Simon Stuart. ""Many have an arsenal of compounds stored in their skin that have the potential to address a multitude of human diseases."" But as amphibians die out, so do opportunities to develop new medicines, he said. The southern gastric brooding frog, for instance, could have led to the development of a treatment for human peptic ulcers had it not gone extinct, Stuart said. ""We simply cannot afford to let this current amphibian extinction crisis go unchecked,"" he said. Andrew Blaustein, who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago, said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis. ""Amphibians seem to have been hit the hardest of all vertebrate species,"" said Blaustein, a professor of zoology at Oregon State University. ""The long-term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound, and we have to do something about it.""",0.6488491,8940
45,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If climate change were a small house fire, current policy in the European Union and the United Kingdom would ensure that it would destroy not just the house but the entire suburb. Author of ""Carbon Scenarios"" compares global warming to a house fire that the world is currently failing to contain. That's the grim analogy offered by Paul Domjan, author of a new report, ""Carbon Scenarios: Blue sky thinking for a green future"", by the Stockholm Network, a London-based pan-European think tank. The report explores three scenarios on climate change, none of which leads to what's defined by the EU and UK as a 'successful outcome'; a greater than 90 percent chance of temperatures rising by no more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""We have failed,"" Domjan says, adding, ""We will not prevent two degrees of warming."" Continuing the house fire analogy he says, ""The less than two degree scenario is a fire you can put out. With less than three degrees it spreads to other rooms but you can still put it out."" He says global policy of the past ten years looks more like the third -- and worst -- scenario explored by the Carbon Scenarios report -- the one dubbed ""Agree and Ignore.""  In that case, ""your house is unrecognizably destroyed. The positive feedback cycle isn't contained. Your house catches fire, your neighbor's catches fire..."" And so on. Domjan blames the failure of the current climate change policy on the constant stream of compromises by world leaders designed to keep the Kyoto agreement intact. ""This dynamic of making lots of small compromises in order to keep the agreement in place has led to a situation where the agreement has lost a lot of its teeth."" He points to Canada as an example, a signatory to the Kyoto agreement which has ""done nothing"" to implement it. ""During the time it's been a signatory it's been developing massive coal sands projects which are the most polluting way of producing gas and oil in the world,"" he says. ""There's a great international censure against the U.S. for not ratifying Kyoto but nothing has been said about Canada."" ""The coal sands are using so much natural gas and electricity they could have an entire nuclear facility just for themselves."" The three alternative futures explored in the Carbon Scenarios report include ""Kyoto Plus,"" ""Agree and Ignore"" and ""Step Change."" ""Kyoto Plus"" envisages a gradual transition to a global cap on carbon emissions by 2012. Domjan calls it a ""largely successful scenario"" where there's a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising more than 3.31 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. ""That's not a disaster. It's still a world that's recognizable,"" he says. The second scenario -- ""Agree and Ignore"" -- predicts efforts to reduce carbon emissions will ""stall and backslide"" leading to ""competitive regionalism."" There would be a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising no more than 4.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. From that point, temperatures would continue to rise into the next century. The third scenario -- ""Step Change"" -- imagines a radical shift in global policy direction. World leaders would introduce a system of global carbon caps, giving them greater than 90 percent chance of limiting the rise in global average temperatures to 2.85 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Of the three scenarios, ""Step Change"" is the one Domjan personally prefers but the one he concedes is unlikely to happen. ""Our proposal [for a global upstream cap] is similar to but not identical to the proposal from the Kyoto 2 project,"" he says. ""It's a line of thinking that's been around for a while that will provide a healthy alternative to emissions trading."" Under the scheme, the United Nations would impose an annual cap on the amount of carbon that could be produced from fossil fuels. Natural resource companies would have to apply and pay for permits to produce carbon. Compliance would be determined at key points, for example, coal washing stations. ""The problem is how do you get the political impetus to have a big international change like that and for people to accept that this is genuinely going to be dealt with at an international level,"" Domjan asks. The ""Step Change"" scenario supposes that the impetus comes through a threat to U.S. and Chinese economic security. Under the scenario, climate change threatens Sino-U.S.. trade relations so the two combine to lead and enforce global change. ""Our current approach to climate change is moving at the pace of the slowest country,"" Domjan says, adding, ""Here they say we're going to move as quickly as possible and then force others to catch up."" Under that scenario, the need to purchase carbon production permits would push record oil prices even higher as energy companies pass on the cost to consumers. Domjan is confident the global economy could cope -- it's adapted to higher energy prices so far and is likely to prove equally resilient in the future. And the extra cost of fuel, rather going to producers, would be held in a fund controlled by the United Nations. It would be used to help developing nations to use fewer fossil fuels, to support new research and development, to compensate oil producers for the carbon they're not producing, and to establish an emergency fund to deal with the consequences of climate change. Domjan acknowledges that world leaders are unlikely to use the report as the basis for a new global policy, but he hopes they at least take away two key points: ""Whenever possible regulate at the point where there are fewest participants [and] we need to make sure there's a clear price signal so the market can distribute energy efficiently.""",0.6464191,5587
46,"(PopSci.com)  -- Until last December, no one had ever seen the bottom of the Tasman Fracture, a trench that drops more than four kilometers below the surface of the ocean. A group of Australian and American researchers recently spent a month hundreds of kilometers southwest of the Tasmanian coast, exploring the fracture's depths. This funnel-shaped sea squirt, never before seen, will snap shut like a Venus flytrap around shrimp that are unfortunate enough to go near it. Jess Adkins, a professor at Caltech and one of the project's lead scientists, remembers sitting in his control room and watching the underwater life on his monitors with a sense of awe. Once, he says, none of the scientists or pilots said a word for 10 minutes straight as their submersible glided over an undiscovered coral reef full of urchins and sponges and sea stars. The researchers explored the fracture with Jason, a remotely-operated submersible the size of a small car. On loan from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, it carried a high-definition camera that weighed more than 500 pounds and beamed underwater video up to the ship through a long fiber-optic tether. At 3,000 meters below sea level, the crew saw thousands of sea spiders. At 3,500, millions of specimens of a new, purple-spotted sea anemone. At 4,000 meters, a single never-before-seen carnivorous sea squirt with a funnel-shaped body that snapped shut like a Venus flytrap around any shrimp unfortunate enough to brush against it. Back on land, the three new species (the anemone, the sea squirt, and a new kind of barnacle) have drawn the most attention, but it's the team's coral collection, some 10,000 pieces of it, that can tell us about the history of our climate and, perhaps, its future. A coral skeleton acts as a tape recorder of its environment. As it grows, the coral's chemical structure (specifically the weight of its oxygen molecules) varies depending on the temperature of the water around it. And, because the coral's uranium decays into thorium over time, it is conveniently datable. By charting different corals' ages and oxygen weights, researchers can map the ocean's changing temperature. During the coming months, expedition scientists will compare 40,000 years of oceanic and atmospheric records. The ocean's temperature and carbon dioxide levels are important because of their impact on our atmosphere. The watery part of the world absorbs and stores sixty times more CO2 than the atmosphere. Huge reservoirs of the ocean's CO2 lurk in its coldest, densest waters (found in the Tasman Fracture and off Greenland). Because cold water releases more CO2 into the air than warm water, the rate at which bottom water rises to the surface has a profound effect on the atmosphere above. Until recently, we had assumed that our climate was relatively stable. After all, for the past 10,000 years -- during which we developed the alphabet, electrical wiring, and microchip necessary for this article -- little has changed. But early-'90s research on Greenland's ice core proved that, over the past 100,000 years, climate stability has been the exception, not the norm. During the last glacial period, global temperatures fluttered up and down by as much as several degrees in as little as a decade. CO2 levels in the atmosphere changed along with the temperature, though more slowly. The researchers' ultimate goal is to see if changes in the ocean followed or proceeded changes in the atmosphere. Adkins suspects that the ocean (and in particular the depths of the ocean) played a part in triggering the climate's sudden fluctuations. He's sure, though, that we're adding more CO2 to the ocean now, in the form of burning fossil fuels, than it has ever held before. Given how little we know about how the ocean regulates the amount of CO2 in our air (we've mapped the surface of Mars, he points out, but not the ocean floor) he wonders if that's such a good idea. We do know that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the ocean makes it more acidic. And whether or not it sets off a climate shift of Pleistocenic proportions, acidification could kill the researchers' newly-discovered, awe-inspiring reef, along with others we haven't even found yet. There would be just as much ocean to study, but less to find. Copyright © 2009 Popular Science .",0.64579844,7237
47,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Dean Still had been researching and developing cleaner, more environmentally-friendly wood-burning stoves for almost two decades when, while working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he spotted a coal stove for sale on a street corner near Tibet, China. Workers at Shengzhou Stove Manufacturers prepare wood-burning stoves for firing. He had been looking for an established manufacturer who could mass-produce the more efficient, lower-emission stoves he had been developing with the Aprovecho Research Center (ARC), a non-profit research and education center based in Oregon in the United States. ""It looked perfect. It had all the components,"" Still told CNN. ""I knew we could change it to a wood-burning stove. There was a cell phone number on the side, so I called it."" Shen Huiyang of Shengzhou Stove Manufacturers (SSM), based over a thousand miles away, answered. The two met and a short time later, in August 2007, an agreement was signed between ARC and SSM. Shen's factory began producing the new wood-burning stoves last year. Last week, the two companies were declared ""Global Energy Champions"" by the Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy at a ceremony in London, England. The vast majority of the 60,000 stoves they've sold since entering their partnership have gone to Envirofit International, a U.S.-based non-profit organization which markets the stoves in India, supported by the Shell Foundation. Others are sold in Argentina, Chile, the Marshall Islands, Madagascar, South Africa and Tanzania. Shen said: ""We have produced coal stoves for many years, and it is wonderful to be able to use our experience to make a wood stove that brings benefits to so many people."" The pair won $65,000 to develop the scheme which Still says will be spent on research and development, and to employ more sales people. ""What I'm doing now is talking to the U.N., to relief agencies, just anybody in the world who might have an interest in burning wood more cleanly, and using less of it,"" he said. The principle behind the stove is simple. With a better insulated combustion chamber, the fire requires less wood and burns hot enough for the smoke to combust as well, which means far fewer emissions. According to the World Health Organization, about half the world still cooks with biomass or coal, using open fires or traditional stoves. The resulting emissions cause indoor air pollution, leading to pneumonia, chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer. This indoor air pollution causes 1.6 million deaths a year, primarily among children and women. The emissions also contribute to climate change, and the collection of firewood contributes to deforestation and erosion. ARC say tests performed on the stoves indicate major breakthroughs for both the environment and health in the developing world. The stoves reduce the use of wood for fuel by up to 50 percent, and cut carbon monoxide emissions by up to 70 percent compared to a traditional fire.",0.64520735,5006
48,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The sleek, dark wood has all the characteristics of endangered mahogany from Peru's Amazon rainforest. Kebony is targeting decking manufacturers and boat builders as potential clients of its modified sustainable wood. In reality, it was manufactured in Norway, in a five-day process that instills all the qualities of rare, tropical hardwood into sustainable softwood. The company that makes it, Kebony, says it comes with none of the environmental cost. ""This is a mega turn, people have to act,"" Kebony CEO Christian Jebsen told CNN. ""We have a green solution for the tropical wood market and we are there to take that market or at least be part of it.""  Christian Jebsen talks to CNN » . The global market for wood products from tropical forests is estimated to be worth some $20 billion each year, according to the International Tropical Timber Organization. Most of the wood on the world market now comes from Southeast Asia and Africa, according to the Rainforest Foundation Norway. Tighter controls on logging in Brazil have reduced the amount of hardwood being shipped out of the Amazon, once a popular source for the finest quality mahogany, teak and cedar. ""Each tree is worth maybe $25,000-$40,000 on the international market. And there are lots of trees being taken out [worldwide] -- so this is a large business, a huge business,"" said Lars Løvold, director of the Rainforest Foundation Norway. The United Nations estimates some 13 million hectares of forest are lost worldwide each year, equivalent to an area the size of Greece or Nicaragua. Their absence is said to contribute more carbon emissions each year than the global transport sector. Demand for luxury hardwood is by no means the main cause of deforestation. Clearing land for agriculture and the collection of wood for fuel are the main drivers, but Løvold said the lucrative market for hardwood provides a compelling incentive for loggers to move into previously untouched areas. ""Almost all deforestation starts with the logging,"" Løvold told CNN. ""The logging doesn't necessarily end up in the total clearance of an area, it just opens up the area, it takes out all the valuable trees and makes it much easier."" Kebony's move into the global wood market follows more than a decade of research started in the late 1990s by Canadian scientist Marc Schneider of the University of New Brunswick. Rigorous testing took place before the first trial production in 2004. Strong demand for the product convinced the company to build a new plant with ten times the production capacity, which opened in January. ""What we are doing with our technology is to permanently transform the wood so it doesn't change. Our process is 100 percent environmentally friendly,"" Jebsen told CNN. The process involves injecting softwood with a patented formula which includes Furfuryl alcohol, a waste by-product of sugar cane production. The wood is then subjected to pressure, heated and dried before being cured at high temperatures to create a product that the company says is stronger, more stable than untreated softwood and weather-proof. Kebony's environmental credentials have been endorsed with the receipt of the Nordic region's eco-label, the Swan. It's also received Norway's national environmental prize, the ""Glass Bear."" On a cost basis, the company says it can compete with the price of authentic teak on the European market. ""You can buy a cubic meter of teak in Europe for anything between 3,000 euros ($4,000) up to 10,000 euros ($14,000), depending on the quality. I would say we are competitive with that,"" Jebsen said. Kebony is ""slightly more expensive"" when compared to pressure-treated wood, but it doesn't contain any of the potentially harmful metals or pesticides that are commonly used to improve the wood's durability. Jebsen sees some of the company's best opportunities in the boat-building industry, where rare teak from Myanmar is being used at the luxury end of the market. ""We believe multiple boat manufacturers will start to use Kebony very soon -- some have already started,"" he said. The company is also planning a move into the U.S. decking market where it's scouting for clients and recruiting distributors. ""The U.S. decking market, which is using toxic impregnated, metal-based wood modification methods, together with tropical wood, is [worth] about five billion dollars, so the market is obviously enormous,"" Jebsen said.",0.64436424,5657
49,"(CNN) -- The bodies of young elephants covered in the brown dirt of dried-up wells tell a heartrending story. A baby elephant in the Gourma region of central Mali had been trapped in a well for three days. Reaching desperately for drops of water, they had lowered their trunks, toppled in, remained trapped and died in Mali's scorching heat. The ""last desert elephants in West Africa"" have ""adapted to survive in the harsh conditions"" they face, Save the Elephants said Monday. But now, the group says, conditions have gone from bad to worse, and they are living ""on the margin of what is ecologically viable."" Save the Elephants distributed new pictures Monday that depict the devastating drought and the struggle for survival in Mali, one of the poorest nations in the world. ""Six elephants have already been found dead,"" the group wrote in a news release accompanying the photos. ""Four others, including three calves, were recently extracted from a shallow well into which they had fallen when searching for water. Only the largest survived."" The youngest are in the most danger, since their smaller trunks can't reach deep into the few remaining wells, the group said. The worst drought in 26 years is threatening the existence of the ""last desert elephants in West Africa,"" the northernmost herds in the continent, Save the Elephants said. The animals, now numbering only about 350 to 450, have been called ""the last elephants of Timbuktu,"" said Jake Wall, a scientist with Save the Elephants. But they're south of Timbuktu, Wall told CNN in a phone interview from Bamako, Mali. ""We tend to refer to them as 'the last Sahelian elephants.' ""  See a map of Mali » . Each year, the elephants trek farther on the fringes of the Sahara to find water. They have the longest migration route of any in the continent, traveling ""in a counterclockwise circle"" of about 700 kilometers (435 miles), Save the Elephants said. The images are signs of the crisis gripping the northwest African nation. The U.N. Development Programme ranks Mali near the bottom of its Human Development Index. It cites a 56 percent poverty rate in the country, with nearly a third of the population unlikely to live past age 40, and an illiteracy rate of 77 percent. The World Food Programme says the majority of infant deaths in Mali are due to malnutrition. The drought, combined with soaring temperatures, has also led to deaths of cattle, Save the Elephants said. ""The stench of rotting corpses fills the air, and what little water remains is putrid and undrinkable by all standards."" In areas where the elephants live and search for water, ""the normal peaceful coexistence between the elephants and herdsmen is starting to break down and giving way to conflict over access to water,"" Wall said. There is some hope for the weeks and months ahead. ""We're hoping the rains start in June, and that will allow the elephants to start drinking out of shallow ponds until the really heavy rains begin"" in July or August, Wall said. But ""urgent action"" is needed in the interim ""to secure water for the elephants,"" Wall's group said in its news release. Save the Elephants, which focuses on helping elephant populations worldwide, said it has partnered with a foundation and the Mali government in its fundraising appeal.",0.643583,3872
50,"(CNN) -- A polar bear falls through thin Arctic ice while searching for food for his family. A humpback whale guides her calf on a perilous 4,000-mile journey. A herd of African elephants in search of water battles a sandstorm in the Kalahari Desert. ""Earth,"" a documentary in theaters Wednesday, follows families of polar bears and other animals. These dramatic scenes await viewers in ""Earth,"" a feature-length documentary hitting theaters Wednesday for Earth Day. For British filmmakers Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, surveying the whole planet for Earth's most exotic species and magnificent landscapes was a daunting task. ""We wanted to tell an epic story about the whole planet,"" co-director Fothergill told CNN in an interview. ""We spent a record 2,000 days in the field. We filmed in 46 countries worldwide, on every continent.""

See photos from ""Planet Earth"" » . But the filmmakers say ""Earth"" is not just a remix of the previous project. ""The movie has over 40 percent original footage. It has a very distinctly different story line than the TV series,"" said Fothergill, who believes small TV screens don't do justice to the images he and Linfield captured.  Watch directors give behind-the-scenes look at 'Earth' » . ""It's very hard [on TV] to give people a true sense of what it's like to be there,"" he said. ""What we think is very special about the movie is its surround sound. When the lions roar, you get a real feeling for being there."" ""Earth"" is the first of a series of movies set to be released under the newly branded Disneynature label -- a spin-off of ""True-Life Adventure,"" Disney's first nature documentary series of the '40s and '50s. Nature movies have made a big impression on national and international audiences in recent years. The 2005 documentary ""March of the Penguins"" cost roughly $3 million to make and sold over $127.4 million in tickets worldwide. Disney plans to release one feature-length film a year. The next one is ""Oceans"" in 2010 followed by ""Big Cats"" and ""Chimpanzees."" In honor of Earth Day 2009, Disney promised to plant a tree for each person who goes to see the movie on its opening weekend. ""Earth"" examines the resilience of life in the face of ever-present danger through three stories of mothers and their young: polar bears in the Arctic, elephants in Africa's Kalahari Desert and humpback whales in the tropical oceans. Thirty-nine other exotic species from all corners of the world get supporting roles. The film is narrated by James Earl Jones, and George Fenton composed the score, which is performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. iReport.com: Tell us about nature and environmental issues near you . Over the course of five years, the filmmakers collected video footage from some of the most remote places on the planet, including the Aurora Australis in Antarctica, the peaks of the Himalayas, and the tropical birds of Papua New Guinea, to reveal the earth's intrinsic beauty and harsh realities. Central to the movie's storyline is the constant tug-of-war between the animal ""actors"" and their ever-changing environment.  See iReporters' photos and video of local ecological issues » . ""Although the elephants and the humpback whales and polar bears are the animal stars, the other big star of the movie is the earth -- the planet itself,"" said Fothergill. ""Really the one thing that unites all of our planet and all the animals that live on it is the seasonality of it."" Without the earth's 23.5-degree tilt to the sun there would be no seasons, no variation in daylight and darkness, said Fothergill. Fothergill and Linfield used state-of-the-art camera technology to capture nature's predator-prey interplay from great distances without disrupting the hunt. Aerial shots of the elephant herd, for example, were shot using a gyro-stabilized Cineflex aerial camera system mounted to the bottom of a helicopter. ""A lot of the breathtaking cinematography in the movie was only achieved through this special camera system,"" Fothergill said. ""We were ... almost a mile away from our action and we could still get all the close-ups we needed."" The filmmakers used this technology to film a sequence of a wolf chasing a herd of caribou. ""Wolves are very shy animals and they run very fast. If you are on the ground, you can never keep up with the action. We filmed the whole hunt from our helicopters and because we were flying so high, the wolves could hardly hear us,"" added Fothergill. The filmmakers also used infrared cameras to film a dramatic nighttime sequence of 30 lions in Botswana joining forces to attack an elephant. Fothergill and Linfield couldn't use lights or normal cameras because they would have frightened away the animals. ""Probably the most dangerous single situation was filming the lions at night attacking the elephant,"" Fothergill said. ""Apart from the woman who was looking through an infrared sensitive camera, nobody else could see anything. We were right in the middle of the action and there was a constant concern that the elephants would come charging through our vehicle. That was pretty hairy."" Another high-speed, high-definition camera, originally developed to film car crash tests, was used to capture an eye-popping scene of a Great White shark leaping out of the water to devour a seal in midair. The camera was able to film shots at 1,000 frames per second, slowing shots by as much as 40 times their original speed. The images were captured directly onto a computer allowing for an endless stream of video while maintaining the detail and clarity of the shot. ""In normal speeds it's gone in seconds, but in slow motion, when you see it lasting 40 seconds to a minute, you get a real sense of the beauty, the scale and the size and power of that shot which is exactly what we wanted,"" Fothergill said. Not a single image in the film was computer generated, Fothergill said. Time-lapse camera technology allowed the filmmakers to condense a year's worth of seasonal changes into a seamless 30-second shot. Fothergill says his formula for movie-making success is simple: ""A lot of waiting around, a lot of patience and a lot of failure."" The filmmaker believes those failures -- missed opportunities, days of waiting for animals to appear -- paid off in the end. He hopes audiences will be entertained while escaping into the wonders of a world they don't often see. ""We wanted to give people this wonderful journey and say, 'Look, it's a really beautiful planet and it's still ... worth preserving.""",0.6434033,3182
51,"(CNN) -- Forget lawn mowers. Maryland officials have found a natural way to combat brush while protecting a threatened species. Maryland officials wanted an eco-friendly solution that wouldn't hurt the area's bog turtles. Forty bearded goats have been dispatched by the State Highway Administration to control plant growth in the area. They have been munching in an enclosed area for a week; they will stay until September, but will be put back to work next spring. The project is part of Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's ""Smart, Green and Growing"" legislative package, aimed at reducing the state's greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020. The pilot program will be evaluated at the end of two years, and officials will determine whether to send goats to other grazing projects on state highways, according to David Buck, a spokesman for the highway administration. The goats are reducing the state's carbon footprint and protecting the area's bog turtles, listed as threatened. In addition, he said, the animals are much cheaper than a mowing program: State costs are about $10,000 for two years, most of that for delivery and veterinary services. But the decision to utilize goats was not an easy one. Other herbivorous (plant-eating) animals were considered. Cows were ruled out because they are too heavy, and their hooves could stomp the small, colorful-shelled bog turtles. Sheep? Well, they just aren't goats. ""Goats were just a viable solution,"" Buck said. ""They do not eat moving things. They will not crush [the turtles] out there."" Maryland is not the first to launch such an initiative. Officials in Hempstead, New York, bought natural grass cutters for a 50-acre park and preserve this year, said Mike Deery, town spokesman. The goats -- Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, Happy and Doc -- were named after dwarves in the fairy tale ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" In Vail, Colorado, officials have introduced 500 weed-eating goats in public areas after residents asked for an alternative to pesticides and chemicals. The initiative costs the town about $500 a day, the National League of Cities said. In Denver, signs touting ""Goats at Work"" alert passers-by to the animals' presence on vacant lots managed by the park system. The goats cost the city about $200 an acre, according to the National League of Cities. Environmental activists hail the measure, calling it innovative and worth implementing. ""Most times you can replace small engines that are sources of greenhouse gases with more natural systems, that's a good thing,"" said Bill Brower of GlobalGiving, a Washington nonprofit organization that describes itself as an online marketplace of grass-roots green projects.",0.64263344,6349
52,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With every click of his camera, Japanese photographer and activist Shuuichi Endou hopes to draw attention to the plight of Tuvalu, a remote nation of people whose home is slowly disappearing. Tuvalu is the world's fourth smallest country behind Vatican City, Monaco and Pacific Ocean neighbor Nauru. He's taking 10,000 photos, one of each person who lives there, to show the world the human face of climate change. ""Tuvaluans do not ask much, neither goods nor money,"" he says. ""In Japan, people sacrifice their time and life to get more goods and money. I hope the viewers see the contrast by looking at the photos. We're sacrificing peaceful Tuvalu."" At first glance, Tuvalu is an island paradise, 26 square kilometers of white sand and lush foliage in the Pacific Ocean, north of Fiji. But the sea level is rising, so much so that the nation's water has become too salty to drink and to grow vegetables, especially taro, a vegetable that was once the island's staple food. ""As they don't have water and food, they began to import food from overseas, says Endou, who set up the NGO Tuvalu Overview to highlight their cause. ""As they began to import, their consumption has been increasing. As a result, more and more products began to be imported. This changed Tuvaluans' diet and increased the amount of waste."" A global appeal . Tuvalu's government considers the situation so urgent it has allocated some of the nation's meager budget to pay for its own permanent ambassador to the United Nations in New York. Afelee Pita took up the job in December 2006 and within months had given perhaps the most important speech ever made by a Tuvaluan: an address to a Special Session of the United Nations Security Council on Energy, Climate and Security. ""That was my very first statement that I issued and it was also a challenging one because it had never been done before, particularly at that level at the Security Council,"" Pita says. He told the assembled dignitaries: ""The world has moved from a global threat once called the Cold War, to what now should be considered the 'Warming War'. Our conflict is not with guns and missiles but with weapons from everyday lives -- chimney stacks and exhaust pipes."" click here for the full speech . New York is a long way from home for the native Tuvaluan. Back on the island he'd be more likely to go for an early morning canoe ride than negotiate thousands of commuters on the subway. ""Living in New York is totally different compared to where we come from. Life is not that easy of course. You have so many strangers. At home, you know everybody [and] whatever you do everybody knows,"" he laughs. Securing a future . While he'd much rather be at home -- ""Definitely there's nothing like home"" -- Pita feels that his time in New York is vital in helping to secure the future of the islands. ""My ultimate objective is to contribute as much as I can in terms of trying to establish relations with as many member states in the UN as possible, and more importantly to secure some sort of commitment from the international community in terms of development projects and any kind of assistance they can provide to us."" The Tuvalu nation wants to invest in renewable energy projects, to reduce the island's own reliance on fossil fuels for energy. ""Sometimes you have to clean your own house first before you look outside,"" Pita says. In English, Tuvalu means ""eight standing together"". On the issue of climate change, Tuvalu hopes the world will stand together with them. ""To me it's not an easy issue to solve, particularly in terms of trying to get the commitment of rich countries,"" Pita says. ""I can, of course, understand their reasoning and how they look at the issue but I think what we need to do is to continue raising our concerns and hopefully one day the community will listen and try to commit something.""",0.64147115,9101
53,"(CNN) -- Around 200 new species of frogs have been found in Madagascar, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. A study has found nearly 200 new species of frogs in Madagascar. A study identified between 129 and 221 new species of frogs on the island. The Spanish Scientific Research Council (CSIC), who carried out the study, believe the find could practically double the number of amphibians known in the world if the results are extrapolated at a global scale. The study, published in the journal ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA,"" suggests that the number of amphibian species in Madagascar has been significantly underestimated. ""The diversity of species in Madagascar is far from being known and there is still a lot of scientific research to be done. Our data suggest that the number of new species of amphibians not only has been underestimated but it is spatially widespread, even in well studied areas,"" said Professor David R. Vieites, CSIC researcher to the press at the Spanish National Natural Sciences Museum in Madrid. ""For example, two of the most visited and studied national parks, Ranomafana and Mantadía/Analamazaotra, harbor 31 and 10 new species respectively."" Dr. Frank Glaw, curator of herpetology at the Zoologische Staatssammlung from Munich was part of the research team: ""During the past 15 years, we discovered and described over 100 new frog species from Madagascar, which led us to believe that our species inventory is almost complete. But as our new surveys show, there are many more species than we suspected,"" he said in a press statement. The paper suggests that the total biodiversity on the island could be much higher in other species as well, so the actual destruction of natural habitats may be affecting more animals than previously thought. This has important consequences for conservation planning, as the rate of destruction of rainforests in Madagascar has been one of the highest in the planet, with more than 80 percent of the historic surface of rainforest already lost, according to the study's authors. Almost a quarter of the new species discovered have not been found yet in protected areas, but the unstable political situation in Madagascar has also been cited as hampering conservation efforts. ""Although a lot of reserves and national parks have been created in Madagascar during the last decade, the actual situation of politic instability is allowing the cut of the forest within national parks, generating a lot of uncertainty about the future of the planned network of protected areas"", said Vieites. Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and one of the most biodiverse areas globally, with a high degree of endemic species. ""To get an idea of its biodiversity --while in the Iberian Peninsula [there] are about 30 species of amphibians and in Germany about 20, in a single locality in Madagascar we can find around 100 species of frogs,"" said Vieites. Dr. Miguel Vences, professor at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, who was also part of the study team, and believes that a century of new species discovery is just beginning: ""People think that we know which plant and animal species live on this planet. But the majority of life forms on Earth is still awaiting scientific recognition.""",0.63932675,3707
55,"(CNN) -- Some 220 square miles of ice has collapsed in Antarctica and an ice shelf about seven times the size of Manhattan is ""hanging by a thread,"" the British Antarctic Survey said Tuesday, blaming global warming. Scientists say the size of the threatened shelf is about 5,282 square miles. ""We are in for a lot more events like this,"" said professor Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Scambos alerted the British Antarctic Survey after he noticed part of the Wilkins ice shelf disintegrating on February 28, when he was looking at NASA satellite images. Late February marks the end of summer at the South Pole and is the time when such events are most likely, he said.  Watch aerial footage of the area » . ""The amazing thing was, we saw it within hours of it beginning, in between the morning and the afternoon pictures of that day,"" Scambos said of the large chunk that broke away on February 28. The Wilkins ice shelf lost about 6 percent of its surface a decade ago, the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on its Web site . Another 220 square miles -- including the chunk that Scambos spotted -- had splintered from the ice shelf as of March 8, the group said. ""As of mid-March, only a narrow strip of shelf ice was protecting several thousand kilometers of potential further breakup,"" the group said. Scambos' center put the size of the threatened shelf at about 5,282 square miles, comparable to the state of Connecticut, or about half the area of Scotland.  See a map and photos as the collapse progressed » . Once Scambos called the British Antarctic Survey, the group sent an aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to examine the extent of the breakout. ""We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage,"" said Jim Elliott, according to the group's Web site. ""Big hefty chunks of ice, the size of small houses, look as though they've been thrown around like rubble -- it's like an explosion,"" he said. ""Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened,"" David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey said, according to the Web site. ""I didn't expect to see things happen this quickly. The ice shelf is hanging by a thread -- we'll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be."" But with Antarctica's summer ending, Scambos said the ""unusual show is over for this season."" Ice shelves are floating ice sheets attached to the coast. Because they are already floating, their collapse does not have any effect on sea levels, according to the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey. Scambos said the ice shelf is not currently on the path of the increasingly popular tourist ships that travel from South America to Antarctica. But some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse. ""Wildlife will be impacted, but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world,"" he said. ""The ecosystem is pretty resilient."" Several ice shelves -- Prince Gustav Channel, Larsen Inlet, Larsen A, Larsen B, Wordie, Muller and Jones -- have collapsed in the past three decades, the British Antarctic Survey said. Larsen B, a 1,254-square-mile ice shelf, comparable in size to the U.S. state of Rhode Island, collapsed in 2002, the group said. Scientists say the western Antarctic peninsula -- the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America -- has warmed more than any other place on Earth over the past 50 years, rising by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit each decade. Scambos said the poles will be the leading edge of what's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues. ""Even though they seem far away, changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres, with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns,"" he said. News of the Wilkins ice shelf's impending breakup came less than two weeks after the United Nations Environment Program reported that the world's glaciers are melting away and that they show ""record"" losses. ""Data from close to 30 reference glaciers in nine mountain ranges indicate that between the years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 the average rate of melting and thinning more than doubled,"" the UNEP said March 16. The most severe glacial shrinking occurred in Europe, with Norway's Breidalblikkbrea glacier, UNEP said. That glacier thinned by about 10 feet in 2006, compared with less than a foot the year before, it said. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Marsha Walton contributed to this report.",0.63773483,575
56,"(CNN) -- Changing winter conditions are causing Scotland's wild Soay sheep to get smaller, according to a study that suggests climate change can trump natural selection. Can't see me now: Climate change could be shrinking Soay sheep in Scotland. The authors of the study published in ""Science"" believe that it highlights how wide-ranging the effects of global climate change can be, adding further complexity to the changes we might expect to see in animal populations in future. ""It's only in the last few years that we've realized that evolution can influence species' physical traits as quickly as ecological changes can. This study addresses one of the major goals of population biology, namely to untangle the ways in which evolutionary and environmental changes influence a species' traits,"" said Andrew Sugden, deputy and international managing editor at Science. The researchers analyzed body-weight measurements and life-history data for the female members of a population of Soay sheep. The sheep live on the island of Hirta in the St. Kilda archipelago of Scotland and have been studied closely since 1985. They selected body size because it is a heritable trait, and because the sheep have, on average, been decreasing in size for the last 25 years. According to the findings lambs are not growing as quickly as they once did as winters have become shorter so do not need to put on as much as weight in the first months of life to survive. The results suggest that the decrease is primarily an ecological response to environmental variation over the last 25 years. Evolutionary change, the report says, has contributed relatively little. ""Sheep are getting smaller. Well, at least the wild Soay sheep living on a remote Scottish island are. But according to classic evolutionary theory, they should have been getting bigger, because larger sheep tend to be more likely to survive and reproduce than smaller ones, and offspring tend to resemble their parents,"" said study author Tim Coulson of Imperial College London. ""Our findings have solved a paradox that has tormented biologists for years -- why predictions did not match observation. Biologists have realized that ecological and evolutionary processes are intricately intertwined, and they now have a way of dissecting out the contribution of each. Unfortunately it is too early to tell whether a warming world will lead to pocket-sized sheep,"" said Coulson.",0.6355898,6784
58,"(CNN) -- I asked a knowledgeable environmentalist earlier this week: ""How big a story is the CRU scandal in your community?"" ""The what?"" ""The e-mails hacked at the Climate Research Unit at [the British] East Anglia University?"" ""Ah."" He smiled. ""It says something that I didn't immediately recognize what you were talking about. I suppose on my side we'd take the same view that the Pentagon took of Abu Ghraib: a few bad apples on the night shift."" Meanwhile, on the right, the story is the biggest scandal since the leak of the Pentagon Papers. Seemingly unperturbed by the CRU embarrassment, President Obama will shortly jet to Copenhagen to pledge reductions in U.S. carbon emissions. The Democratic majority in Congress continues to work on a cap-and-trade bill. At the same time, Gallup has recorded an amazing 20 point drop since summer 2008 in the number of Republicans who believe that global warming is occurring. Among Republican conservatives, the drop is slightly smaller -- 13 points -- but that's because so few of them believed in the reality of global warming in the first place. It used to be said that we were all entitled to our own opinions, but not entitled to our own facts. No more. In modern America, we choose our facts to fit our opinions. Michael Barone drove this point home in a 2008 column for the magazine of the American Enterprise Institute: . Americans' views of the economy are increasingly a function of voting behavior or party loyalty, rather than the other way around. In early 2006, a time of vibrant economic growth, 56 percent of Republicans said the economy was excellent or good, while only 28 percent of independents and 23 percent of Democrats agreed. Maybe Republicans were just doing better than Democrats? No -- the partisan divergence held true among Republicans and Democrats even of the same income level. The same effect showed up in reverse in the 1990s. Under President Clinton, Democrats were more likely to assess the economy positively than were Republicans of the same income level. Media critics often blame cable, talk radio and blogs for isolating the public into self-satisfied information communities. And for sure, Fox News, MSNBC, Rush Limbaugh and the Daily Show have done good business serving niche markets. But it's a real question: What is cause and what is effect? Maybe customers always wanted to have their pre-existing opinions confirmed. Notice how often 19th century newspapers had names like the ""Clay County Whig"" or the ""Jacksonville Democrat."" What were these old county papers if not the Fox News and MSNBC of their day? The whole global warming debate has been distorted from the start by intellectual self-ghettoization. Suffused by self-righteousness, the East Anglian scientists felt entitled to twist the evidence and delete the counter-evidence.   iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change . But it also helped that they felt sure they would not be caught. They had defined their community in a way that excluded skepticism, that defined skeptics as the enemy, as liars, as Holocaust deniers. Private e-mails and documents allegedly from the servers at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, a world-renowned center on the study of climate change, are thought to have been leaked by hackers. Everything important about global warming remains disputed: . How fast is it happening? How much of it is attributable to human activity? How dangerous is it? How much should we pay to avert or mitigate it? Who should do the paying? How are to begin to reach conclusions if we cannot even agree on the rules of discussion? The most famous public document on global warming calls itself ""An Inconvenient Truth"" -- and yet that document itself is filled with untruths, on every subject from sea levels to polar bears. (The bears are doing fine, populations at record levels in the Canadian Arctic.) In his first book, ""Earth in the Balance,"" former Vice President Al Gore wrote that human consciousness itself may be the most important obstacle to environmental improvement. He spoke more accurately than he knew. The global warming controversy has been pervaded from the start by the human instinct to divide the world into ""us"" and ""them"" -- and then believe only the news we hear from ""us."" Global warming advocates can see this weakness in their opponents. It was the same weakness in themselves that led the advocates themselves to cheat and twist and betray scientific standards and public trust.

63,"L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- Leaders of both industrialized powers and emerging economies have agreed to work together on setting a goal to limit global warming to levels recommended by scientists, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the G-8 summit. G-8 leaders wait for an aide to remove toe markers as they pose for a family photo in L'Aquila, Italy, on July 8. The G-8 countries -- comprising the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia -- agreed to a target of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050 to try to prevent the Earth's atmosphere from warming by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), Obama said. Thursday's meeting with emerging economies including China also secured a commitment from the developing countries to work for limiting global warming to the 2 degree Celsius threshold, Obama said. ""Developing countries among us will promptly undertake actions whose projected effects on emissions represent a meaningful deviation from business as usual in the midterm, in the context of sustainable development, supported by financing, technology, and capacity-building,"" said the declaration from Thursday's Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. The declaration stopped short of setting targets for the developing nations. Obama said the emerging economies agreed to work toward setting specific targets.  Watch report from CNN's Ed Henry » . He called the commitment of the emerging economies ""an important stride forward"" in minimizing climate change, but acknowledged that the issue he called one of the most challenging of our times would be difficult to confront. Environment groups gave the announcement a cautious welcome. Joanne Green, head of policy at Cafod, told the Press Association: ""Agreeing that average global temperatures should not rise by more than two degrees is forward movement but it is woefully inadequate compared to what was needed."" And Oxfam spokesman Antonio Hill said: ""Today 17 countries, responsible for more than 80 percent of the world's emissions, agreed for the first time that it'd be nice to take the road which stops the planet heating up by more than 2 degrees. ""While G-8 countries continue to speed in the opposite direction, towards a cooked planet and climate catastrophe, poor people want to know whether rich coutries will now actually turn around before it's too late."" The vast majority of climate change scientists warn that warming above the 2 degree Celsius threshold would mean potentially catastrophic impacts on Earth. U.N.-led negotiations on a new global climate change treaty are aiming to conclude with an agreement among 192 nations in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. Obama said the G-8 targets and work with developing countries are intended to support the international climate change treaty that will succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. In the United States, Congress is debating a new energy policy that could codify the G-8 target for emissions reductions in law. A House bill that recently passed has the same target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050, but Senate passage of a measure remains uncertain.  Watch as leaders tour quake zone » . Republican opponents contend the United States would put itself at a competitive disadvantage by setting firm targets when China and other emerging economies would be free to pollute without limits. Some Democratic senators also fear harmful effects on fossil fuel industries in their states. The Major Economies Forum led by Obama included the G-8 countries along with Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Australia, South Africa and others. The Forum nations account for 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Its declaration Thursday outlined a range of actions including funding mechanisms for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping nations and ecosystems adapt to global warming, along with more money to pursue alternative energy sources. The declaration said the world's emissions should peak as soon as possible and then start going down. It acknowledged that industrial powers have emitted most of the pollution causing climate change and therefore have a greater responsibility in responding. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the creation of an institute to study and advance so-called clean coal technology intended to reduce the harmful pollution from coal-fired energy. In addition, the declaration recognized ""that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in developing countries, bearing in mind that social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities in developing countries and that low-carbon development is indispensable to sustainable development.""  Watch what's on agenda at G-8 summit » . Todd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change, noted that China and other emerging economies had never previously acknowledged the 2-degree Celsius threshold or committed to reducing emissions from current levels. He called those steps ""significant,"" but conceded they fell short of binding commitments to meet specific reductions goals. However, Stern said the 2-degree threshold was the ""underpinning"" of the global goal for an overall 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the 80 percent cuts targeted by the G-8 countries. Obama acknowledged the United States has previously failed to meet its responsibilities regarding climate change, and he pledged a renewed commitment and leadership. In his remarks, Rudd made a point of welcoming the new leadership role by Obama and the United States. Obama will meet Friday with Pope Benedict XVI, who launched a verbal assault on global capitalism ahead of the G-8 meeting, lambasting ""grave deviations and failures"" and calling for a ""profoundly new way of understanding business enterprise.""

64,"(CNN) -- Scientists in Colombia have unearthed the remains of a true prehistoric monster believed to be the biggest snake ever to have lived on Earth. An artist's impression of what Titanoboa cerrejonensis would have looked like. Named Titanoboa cerrejonensis, the snake would have weighed 1,140 kilograms (2,500 pounds) and measured 13 meters (42.7 feet) nose to tail tip -- dwarfing the largest modern pythons and anacondas which can grow to 6 meters (19.5 feet). Scientists believe it slithered around the planet between 58 and 60 million years ago. Geologist David Polly, who identified the position of the fossil vertebrae which made a size estimate possible, said in a statement Wednesday: ""At its greatest width, the snake would have come up to about your hips. The size is pretty amazing. ""But our team went a step further and asked, how warm would the Earth have to be to support a body of this size?"" Titanoboa's fossilized remains were discovered at a coal mine in the tropical Cerrejon region of northern Colombia by an international team of scientists. ""Truly enormous snakes really spark people's imagination, but reality has exceeded the fantasies of Hollywood,"" paleontologist Jonathan Bloch, who co-led the expedition, told reporters. ""The snake that tried to eat Jennifer Lopez in the movie 'Anaconda' was not as big as the one we found."" Based on the snake's size, the team was able to calculate that the mean annual temperature in equatorial South America 60 million years ago would have been about 91 degrees Fahrenheit, about 10 degrees warmer than today, Bloch said. ""Tropical ecosystems of South America were surprisingly different 60 million years ago,"" said Bloch. ""It was a rainforest, like today, but it was even hotter and the cold-blooded reptiles were all substantially larger. ""The result was, among other things, the largest snakes the world has ever seen...and hopefully ever will."" According to Nature.com, snakes are poikilotherms (cold-blooded) that, unlike humans, need heat from their environment to power their metabolism. Therefore research suggests that at the time the region would have had to be no less than 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit for the snake to have survived. Most large snakes today live in the tropical regions of South America and south-east Asia, where the high temperatures allow them to grow to impressive sizes. Meanwhile, Carlos Jaramillo -- who was also part of the expedition -- said the tropical rainforest at Cerrejon appeared to have thrived at these temperatures. ""This data challenges the view that tropical vegetation lives near its climatic optimum, and it has profound implications in understanding the effect of current global warming on tropical plants,"" he said.",0.6303277,3245
65,"(CNN) -- There are several definitions of where the Northwest Passage begins and ends, but using the Arctic Circle is certainly the most encompassing, so we've been holding our breath until we crossed this line. The crew has negotiated some stunning and treacherous waters to sail the Northwest Passage. The Arctic Circle (66 30N) marks the lowest latitude at which the midnight sun is ever seen. We've had some stormy weather along the Baffin Island coast. We had waves up to 8m high and winds over 40 knots. Silent Sound was being tossed around a lot, and I was thrown clear across the cabin on one occasion, suffering a minor concussion that kept me in my bunk for several days. Now that we're out of the Arctic Archipelago and into the open sea, we are seeing more icebergs, instead of ice floes. Ice floes are frozen seawater while icebergs are chunks of ice broken off glaciers in the High Arctic. Bergs begin as snow falling on land, which is then compressed into ice. Even though the icebergs we see are easily 20 or 30 meters high, most of their volume is below water. Only about one third of their entire volume is visible above water. This means you have to stay well clear of them because they may spread out under water, like an upside down mushroom. We've also started thinking about what we've experienced and learned this summer. By far the most impressive feature of the Arctic has been its people. In every town we visited we met complete strangers who offered us help, welcomed us into their homes and provided us with hot showers and food. So many people showed genuine interest in our journey and generously told us about their lives, and we left nearly every town with a few fish or other wild game in our fridge. Our mission when we left Victoria, British Columbia in June was to find out how climate change is impacting Arctic communities. We saw and heard about the impacts, from slumping land due to the melting of permafrost to hunter stories about the northward migration of species and the challenge that early ice break up poses for transportation. But more importantly, I'm leaving the Arctic with a sense that its communities are at a crossroads. They underwent a rapid change in the 1950s and 60s when people moved off the land and into settlements. Now, those settlements are bracing themselves for unprecedented change due to resource exploration, economic development, political wrangling and an influx of new wealth, people and social forces. They're all tied to climate change in one way or another, and they leave Arctic community leaders with a big job ahead of them. Climate change is turning the spotlight on the Arctic, and hopefully that will mean federal government help where it is needed to aid the Inuit in making wise choices for their future. I've been struck by how although the Arctic is very different place than the urban habitat most of us occupy, it is not in a different time. To maintain a romantic notion of the Arctic as a place time has forgotten where life is simple and basic would be an insult to the people that call it home and be a mistake. Many of the challenges brought to the Arctic by climate change and economic development are the same as those faced around the world. It's just a little colder, and a little more remote. While we've begun mulling over our experiences this summer, it's too soon for the crew of Silent Sound to relax. We are still about three weeks from our final port. And the sailing is getting cold and tiring. The nights are very dark at sea, and temperatures are hovering just above zero degrees Celsius. On many days we are sailing in snow, rain and sleet. Our onboard heater has broken down, so we have to wear extra layers in our sleeping bags to keep warm. This also means that the condensation builds up in the boat and it gets pretty damp, making it hard to dry our socks and gloves. But Halifax is in sight, and we can get some comfort from our accomplishment of completing the Northwest Passage.",0.6297295,6778
66,"(CNN) -- China's giant pandas are believed to be safe after Monday's earthquake, but concern is growing over how they will get their next meals. Questions remain about whether infrastructure damage will harm the giant pandas' supply of bamboo. Authorities confirmed Tuesday that captive animals in two of China's major panda reserves were alive, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency. The Wolong Giant Panda Reserve Center in southwest Sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas, who were reported safe Tuesday. Staff and critters at neighboring Chengdu Panda Breeding and Research Center were also reported safe, according to a spokesperson for the Atlanta Zoo, which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve. Concern arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals' habitat, as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the Sichuan province. The mountainous, densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild, making it an obvious location for research bases like Wolong and Chengdu. Giant pandas roam the forest in ""open cages"" that are meant to provide them with a safe, natural environment that will prepare them for release. With the safety of the pandas confirmed, the animals' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases, which contain breeding facilities and triage centers. Bamboo, the pandas' primary source of food, is a major agricultural product in the region, but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question. ""Wolong is hard to access under normal conditions, so the heavy road damage makes it even harder,"" said Kerry Zobor, spokeswoman for the World Wildlife Fund. Zobor said the WWF had confirmed the safety of staff members based in Beijing but had not received word on the conditions in Wolong. She said the WWF was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck. The group has not been located. Scientists in the United States are hopeful that Chinese researchers will adapt to the situation facing them. David Wildt with the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park in Washington says scientists in Wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before. In the late 1990s, the captive giant panda population was in decline, with more animals dying than were born, Wildt said. Thanks to a collaborative effort with American scientists, the Wolong staff was able to reverse the trend. ""Our Chinese colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems,"" said Wildt, who has visited Wolong many times as part of the Smithsonian's affiliation with the research base. ""Because of their efforts, the population is on the rise today."" Wildt said that Chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources. ""Artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas. They're not a complete substitute, but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet,"" said Wildt, who has worked with two pandas that the Smithsonian has on loan from Wolong. ""Right now, we're mostly concerned about the staff. If the staff is fine, then the animals will be fine,"" Wildt said.",0.6293484,489
67,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former President Carter warned members of Congress on Tuesday that America's failure to achieve energy independence is threatening the country's national security, undermining its long-term potential for economic growth and contributing to global warming. Former President Carter said Tuesday that the United States must end its energy-based vulnerability. ""Collectively, nothing could be more important than this question of energy,"" Carter said during a rare presidential appearance before a congressional committee. ""I would guess that our entire status as a leading nation in the world will depend on the role that we play in energy and environment in the future."" Carter, who in 1977 famously declared the fight for energy independence to be ""the moral equivalent of war,"" told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that reaching that goal is crucial to ending the country's ""vulnerability to possible pressures and blackmail."" Right now, he noted, ""whether we admit it or not, we are very careful not to aggravate our major oil suppliers.""  Watch Carter talk about energy and security » . He also asserted that more jobs will be gained than lost by transitioning the country away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner, renewable energy sources. Carter's testimony came as Congress continues its consideration of broad-reaching energy legislation with the potential to dramatically tighten emissions controls while reshaping America's environmental standards. Among other things, the American Clean Energy and Security Act would create a controversial ""cap-and-trade"" system establishing steadily declining limits on greenhouse gas emissions over the next four decades. Under the bill, polluters would be able to buy and sell emissions credits while utilities would be required to generate an increasing amount of power from renewable sources. Congressional attention to the issue is being driven by President Obama, who, like Carter, has placed energy near the top of his domestic agenda. Carter suggested that energy reform advocates craft an omnibus proposal that could be considered collectively by Congress in order to minimize ""adverse influence of special interest groups"" opposed to any major changes. Powerful entrenched interests ultimately helped derail his administration's energy agenda, he said. Carter noted that his administration nevertheless succeeded in reducing net oil imports by 50 percent, from 8.6 to 4.3 million barrels per day. But after ""a long period of energy complacency,"" he said, daily imports to the United States are now almost 13 million barrels. America consumes 2.5 times more oil than China and 7.5 times more than India, he noted. On a per capita basis, the United States consumes 12 times more oil than China and 28 times more than India. ""Although our rich nation can afford these daily purchases, there is little doubt that, in general terms, we are constrained not to alienate our major oil suppliers, which puts a restraint on our nation's foreign policy,"" Carter said. The former president reminded committee members that, as part of his drive for renewable energy, he had ordered 32 solar panels to be placed on the roof of the White House in 1979. But the panels were removed ""almost instantaneously after [Ronald Reagan] moved into the White House, with assurances to the American people that such drastic action would no longer be necessary."" Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, opened the hearing by noting that the price of a barrel of oil has fallen $90 below the record high hit in summer 2008. Unfortunately, Kerry added, the ""political will to take decisive action has dissipated"" as each past energy crisis has subsided. Carter ""had the courage to tell the truth to Americans [and] set America on the right path in the 1970s,"" Kerry said. ""Regrettably, the ensuing years saw those efforts unfunded [and] stripped away."" Richard Nixon was the first president to set a goal of energy independence, Kerry noted. Nixon called for that goal to be reached by 1980.",0.6289767,8184

Staff and critters at neighboring Chengdu Panda Breeding and Research Center were also reported safe, according to a spokesperson for the Atlanta Zoo, which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve. Concern arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals' habitat, as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the Sichuan province. The mountainous, densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild, making it an obvious location for research bases like Wolong and Chengdu. Giant pandas roam the forest in ""open cages"" that are meant to provide them with a safe, natural environment that will prepare them for release. With the safety of the pandas confirmed, the animals' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases, which contain breeding facilities and triage centers. Bamboo, the pandas' primary source of food, is a major agricultural product in the region, but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question. ""Wolong is hard to access under normal conditions, so the heavy road damage makes it even harder,"" said Kerry Zobor, spokesperson for the World Wildlife Fund. Zobor said WWF had confirmed the safety of staff based in Beijing, but had not received word on the conditions in Wolong. She said the WWF was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck. So far, the group has not been located. Scientists in the United States are hopeful that Chinese researchers will adapt to the situation facing them. David Wildt with the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park in Washington says that scientists in Wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before. In the late 1990s, the captive giant panda population was in decline, with more animals dying than were born, Wildt said. Thanks to a collaborative effort with American scientists, the Wolong staff was able to reverse the trend. ""Our Chinese colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems,"" said Wildt, who has visited Wolong many times as part of the Smithsonian's affiliation with the research base. ""Because of their efforts, the population is on the rise today."" Wildt said that Chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources before. ""Artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas. They're not a complete substitute, but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet,"" said Wildt, who has worked with two pandas that the Smithsonian has on loan from Wolong. ""Right now, we're mostly concerned about the staff. If the staff is fine, then the animals will be fine,"" Wildt said.",0.62816066,483
70,"(CNN) -- Midway Atoll, a small stretch of sand and coral in the middle of the north Pacific, is home to one of the world's largest populations of Laysan albatrosses. Until 1993, U.S. Navy aircraft thundered down the runway of the military base on the island, but now ocean going birds nest and embark on their own epic cross-ocean journeys from the overgrown landing strip. Yet the impact of humans and increasing consumer waste from thousands of miles away continues to have a direct effect on the island's wildlife, as photographic artist Chris Jordan discovered when he traveled there in September. The American photographed the remains of albatross chicks that had died from consuming plastic waste found in the surrounding oceans. According to the artist, not a single piece of plastic in any of the photographs was moved, placed or altered in any way. The nesting babies had been fed the plastic by their parents, who collected what looked to them like food to bring back to their young. From cigarette lighters to bottle caps, the plastic is found in what is now known as the great Pacific garbage patch that stretches across thousands of miles of the Pacific Ocean. Fed a diet of human trash, it is thought that every year tens of thousands of albatross chicks die on Midway from starvation, toxicity and choking. Jordan has examined the environmental effects of consumer society in his previous work.

71,"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday warned participants in the climate change conference in Copenhagen that they are ""running out of time"" to reach an agreement on what to do about global warming. Critics say those attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which began December 7, have made little or no headway toward developing a plan. U.S. officials in Copenhagen and at the White House confirmed that talks broke down Wednesday after the Chinese rejected American demands that they commit to transparency regarding their emissions reductions. Without mentioning China by name, Clinton said their continued refusal would be ""kind of a deal breaker for us."" The uncertainty over whether a deal could be reached before talks end Friday led to speculation that President Barack Obama might not travel to Copenhagen as planned, but White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters he would leave Thursday evening. ""We all know there are real challenges that remain in the hours left to these negotiations,"" Clinton said. ""And it is no secret that we have lost precious time in these past days. In the time we have left here, it can no longer be about us versus them. ""We all face the same challenge together,"" she added. ""We're running out of time. It's unfortunate that there have been problems with the process, difficulties with certain parties being willing to come to the table, all kinds of discussions and disagreements, sometimes about the past rather than about the future."" Without mentioning China by name, Clinton said that nation's continued refusal to come to the table would be ""kind of a deal breaker for us."" Gibbs said the Chinese ""balked"" at the ""strong transparency requirement,"" and he ""hoped they would reconsider."" ""The president is going to travel in hopes of making progress for a strong operational agreement,"" Gibbs said. ""There are no changes in the president's plans."" The agreement Obama is hoping for out of Copenhagen would not be a treaty, nor would it be legally binding. Gibbs acknowledged it would be ""a political agreement that would lead to a treaty"" later. The last time the president traveled to Copenhagen -- in October to try to win the 2012 Olympic bid for Chicago -- he came back empty-handed. ""Coming back with an empty agreement would far worse,"" Gibbs said Thursday. Clinton said the United States is concerned about the ability of needy nations to do their part. The United States is willing to work with other countries to raise $100 billion by 2020 to address the climate-change needs of developing nations, she said. She told delegates that the United States already has joined an effort to provide more immediate funding that would reach $10 billion in 2012. ""After a year of diplomacy, we have come to Copenhagen ready to take the steps necessary to achieve a comprehensive and operational new agreement that will provide a foundation for long-term, sustainable economic growth,"" Clinton said. ""We have now reached the critical juncture in these negotiations. I understand that the talks have been difficult. I know that our team, along with many others, are working hard and around the clock to forge a deal,"" she said. ""But the time is at hand for all countries to reach for common ground and take an historic step that we can all be proud of."" Clinton's announcement was ""enormously encouraging,"" Tim Flannery, an internationally known zoologist, conservationist and explorer, said on CNN's ""Amanpour."" Clinton proposed several core elements that should be included in any plan: decisive national actions; an operational accord ""that internationalizes those actions""; technical and other assistance for needy nations that are ""the most vulnerable and least prepared to meet the effects of climate change; and standards of transparency that provide credibility to the entire process."" ""The world community should accept no less,"" she added. Kandeh Yumkella, director-general of the U.N. Industrial Development Organization, said on ""Amanpour"" he is optimistic that leaders can strike a deal before the conference ends. ""Compared to yesterday, what we have now is that the negotiators have hunkered down,"" he said. ""They're actually in drafting committees."" Flannery agreed. ""If the U.S. can commit to another couple of percent in terms of cuts (in emissions), if the Chinese can increase their efficiency gains by 5 percent, that'll probably be enough to bring the Europeans on board for a 30 percent target, and then we'll be there."" Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who suggested the initial estimate of about $100 billion a year by 2020 to reduce emissions, urged leaders Thursday to reach an agreement that would limit ""long-term, global temperature increases"" to no more than 2 degrees. According to the 10 Downing Street Web site, Brown told the conference that wealthier countries must commit to provide immediate funding for developing countries to reach such a goal. He recommended that financing start in January, with nations providing $10 billion a year by 2012. He called on developing countries to commit to ambitious mitigation actions to handle climate change. ""To the developed world I say: Environmental action is the most powerful engine of job creation in an economy urgently in need of millions of new jobs. ""To the developing world I say: The technology now exists to gain the dividends of a high-growth economy without incurring the damage of a high-carbon economy. ""And to all nations I say: It is not enough for us to do the least we can get away with when history asks that we demand the most of ourselves.""",0.6257697,7844
72,"(CNN) -- Conservationists have found a new population of orangutans in a steep, mountainous corner of Indonesia -- a discovery that significantly adds to the number of the endangered red-haired primates. The orangutans were discovered in a mountainous corner of Indonesia. About 65,000 orangutans are thought to remain in the wild, limited to rain forests on two islands in Malaysia and Indonesia: Borneo and Sumatra. The latest population was found in the eastern edge of Borneo, with conservationists counting 219 nests. Even by conservative estimates, that raises the total number of the orangutan population by at least a couple of hundred, maybe thousands. ""We rarely have something positive to report in the conservation world. Most of the stories are about declining population or animals dying. It's all pretty negative,"" said Erik Meijaard, a senior ecologist with the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy. ""So to find a substantial population of potentially several hundred to several thousand animals is very exciting."" Locals in the area had long spoken of an orangutan population in the hard-to-access limestone mountains of the Kalimantan province. A group of conservationists reached the area in December after driving for a day, taking a boat for another, and then hiking across steep mountainous terrain for two, Meijaard said. The remoteness of the area has meant that the animals have been undisturbed by development. Elsewhere, the orangutan's forest habitat has been cut down for timber extraction and palm oil, used in food and cosmetics. Orangutans, a species of great apes, with hair that is usually reddish-brown instead of the black or brown. The name is derived from the Malay and Indonesian words for ""orang"" (person) and ""hutan"" (forest). They spend most of their time on trees, subsisting on fruit and leading a solitary existence except to mate. The expedition in December found the nests crammed into just a few miles in the 2 million-acre forest.

73,"Beijing, China (CNN)  -- China and the United States, the largest producers of greenhouse gases, will team up to fight climate change and create clean energy, their leaders said Tuesday. Chinese President Hu Jintao and President Obama said their nations will cooperate to advance technologies and work toward a global agreement on reducing carbon emissions. ""As the two largest consumers and producers of energy, there can be no solution to this challenge without the efforts of both China and the United States,"" Obama said. ""That is why we've agreed to a series of important new initiatives in this area."" What would you ask Obama? Share your question for CNN's interview . After Tuesday's meeting, Hu told reporters, ""We agreed to expand our cooperation on climate change, energy and environment,"" which includes developing a China-U.S. clean energy research center. The declaration by Hu and Obama comes ahead of next month's U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and follows recent acknowledgment by the world's top economic powers, including the U.S., that there's no hope of a major breakthrough on climate change by year's end. The U.S. president said the two leaders want to accelerate the world toward a pact to cut greenhouse gases. The leaders did not offer a time frame, however. ""Our aim ... is not a partial accord or a political declaration,"" Obama said, ""but rather an accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational affect. ""This kind of comprehensive agreement would be an important step forward in the effort to rally the world around a solution to our climate challenge."" Instead of reaching a final deal in Copenhagen, a strategy dubbed ""one agreement, two steps"" was unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit over the weekend in Singapore. The aim is to produce a pact over a longer period. The first step would be to have all 191 countries involved in the Copenhagen summit signing on to a framework that includes key ingredients, such as how to finance the coordinated effort to battle climate change. The second step, a binding deal on cutting carbon emissions, would be hashed out in further negotiations. ""Opportunity is knocking. It is up to you to open the door,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Monday.

""Art can play a role in the 21st century for conservation of clean water and healthy oceans,"" he says. ""There are things we can do everyday to protect water and conserve it."" Wyland is taking his campaign for clean water across the nation. Wyland and his non-profit Wyland Foundation will visit kids at zoos, aquariums and schools showing them how they can help conserve water.  Watch Wyland paint a whale shark » . ""If we are going to keep the oceans clean we need to think about what we are doing here on land. We need to protect the rivers, the lakes, the ponds, the streams, the estuaries -- it's all connected. Every drop of water on the planet is connected,"" Wyland explained. Along with mural painting with children, Wyland's Clean Water Challenge tour includes a mobile learning truck where participants can learn about water quality. He hopes to encourage everyone to reduce water waste by 10 million gallons or more over the next year. Wyland and his team kicked off their campaign at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta on October 7. Stops along the East and West coasts as well Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; and Phoenix, Arizona, are planned over the next month. At the Georgia Aquarium, Wyland was surround by children who joined him in painting a mural that will hang inside the aquarium. ""I got to paint a whale shark with kids. That was fun,"" he said. ""We have some great artists here in Georgia."" ""Looking fantastic, everyone. Keep painting!"" Wyland shouted enthusiastically. Roxie Stricker, 8, from Atlanta, Georgia, asked Wyland if she could paint a baby right whale tail right next to his adult right whale tail. ""What a great idea,"" Wyland responded. Wyland says that when children paint their favorite animals of the sea, they become more aware and sensitive to those animals' needs. And it's this awareness that can make a difference. ""I learned that we should start saving water and stop throwing trash in it,"" said Stricker. ""I believe that this art is going to make a difference and these kids are going to change the world,"" Wyland said. ""Every drop counts.""

75,"(CNN) -- Flying penguins are unusual. Especially when they fly on a C-130 Hercules military plane. Almost 400 lost Magellanic penguins march back to the sea after being rescued by animal-welfare groups. In Brazil, 373 young Magellanic penguins were rescued, rehabilitated and released last weekend after their search for food left them stranded, hundreds of miles from their usual feeding grounds. Animal-welfare activists loaded the birds onto a Brazilian air force cargo plane and flew them 1,550 miles to the country's southern coast, where a crowd of onlookers celebrated as the penguins marched back into the sea. ""We are overjoyed to see these penguins waddle back to the ocean and have a second chance at life,"" said veterinarian Dr. Valeria Ruoppolo of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the group that oversaw the rescue.  See photo gallery of rescued penguins » . Magellanic penguins are warm-weather birds that breed in large colonies in southern Argentina and Chile. The young animals then migrate north between March and September, following their favorite fish, the anchovy. The birds are named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who first saw them in 1519. But changes in currents and water temperature apparently confused the juvenile birds, who strayed too far north to the warm beaches of Salvador, Brazil, 870 miles north of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Watch the penguins march into the sea » . Starting in mid-July, in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahía, ""It was just about raining penguins,"" Ruoppolo said. ""There was not much of a food supply. The birds were stranded and emaciated. They had lost all their muscles and body condition."" While occasionally a few birds show up so far north, the unusual sight of hundreds of wayward penguins posed a challenge for animal conservation groups. ""We had to learn how to work with them,"" said Carlos Garcia, a spokesman for IBAMA, the Brazilian Institute for Environment and Renewable Resources. ""Fewer than 20 penguins usually wash ashore, but with such a large number, we had to really understand their biology and learn how to treat them."" The Instituto Mamíferos Aquáticos (Institute for Aquatic Mammals) also fed and cared for the hungry and disoriented birds. Ruoppolo, who is also the emergency relief officer for IFAW, has a lot of experience saving penguins and other animals injured in oil spills. Last week she worked with conservation groups and volunteers to save as many of the birds as possible. ""We showed them how to stabilize the animals, to feed them and give them proper care,"" she said. Healthy Magellanic penguins grow to about 27 inches tall and weigh about 9 pounds. Ruoppolo said IBAMA -- the government's environmental authority -- and the Brazilian military were supportive throughout the unusual relocation mission. On Friday, the penguins were loaded into special crates and put onto the plane for the journey to Pelotas, in southern Brazil. After their first-ever flight, the birds went on a truck ride to the Center for Recovery of Marine Animals, where they rested for 24 hours. The birds released at Cassino Beach the next day had to meet very specific health criteria, said Ruoppolo. ""Their feathers had to be waterproof, their overall body condition had to be good, their lungs healthy, and they had to be able to catch food,"" she said. The youngsters had some adult supervision for their return to the wild. They were released with a small group of adult penguins that had been nursed back to health after surviving an oil spill. Scientists expect the older birds will help guide the little ones to nearby feeding grounds. Some penguins are still being cared for, both in the north and south of Brazil. The newly released birds have bands on their flippers so scientists can follow their progress and learn more about their migratory habits. Of more than 1,600 penguins that washed ashore in northern Brazil, about half are still alive. That is a fairly good outcome, given the fragile status of young birds on their first migration, said Ruoppolo. ""For all species you have animals that die within the first year,"" she said. And without quick human intervention, the consequences would have been much worse. At this point there is no way to know exactly why the animals became stranded. While the Magellanic penguin population is not in jeopardy because of this one event, Ruoppolo said there are other threats, primarily from overfishing.

77,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Sala saunters in the red soil, her wrinkled skin glistening in the sun as she tries to keep up with the rest of the herd. It is hard to believe the 6-week-old, dwarfed by her human keeper, will grow up to be one of nature's biggest beasts. Until then, she lives at a Nairobi orphanage that takes in baby elephants struggling to survive. There, she walks around in the lush wilderness with her peers, drinks soy milk and waves her trunk playfully as her keeper applies sunscreen on her delicate skin. A red garment tied around her back keeps it safe from the sun's glare. Sala is one of scores of animals orphaned by drought, poaching and shrinking habitats, which have decimated wildlife across Kenya. The baby elephant was found wandering, alone and confused, after her mother died of starvation, her caretaker said. Conservation groups such as the David Sheldrick Foundation, where Sala is, have seen an influx of wildlife. The foundation takes in orphaned elephants and rhinos from across the country, a popular tourist destination because of its animals. ""You know if a human child came in need of care, you wouldn't put a bullet in or turn it away,"" said Daphne Sheldrick of the foundation. ""Elephants are the same. ... Whatever comes in, we have to make space."" The facility has more than 20 elephants in Nairobi and more at another center in Tsavo National Park, where they are also rehabilitated. Kenya depends on tourism as a main source of income. Sala taps into that to help earn the $900 monthly cost for her upkeep. She slushes and slides in a mud bath for throngs of tourists and uses her trunk to nudge the only other person she dwarfs -- a squirming toddler. Sala and the other animals will be released back into the wilderness when they are old enough, which takes years. Long after they are gone, their caretakers will still worry about the fragile animals they help nurture.

""This is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now,"" Gore said, speaking to reporters in Palo Alto, California. ""It truly is a planetary emergency, and we have to respond quickly."" The former vice president said he would donate his half of the $1.5 million prize to the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization he founded to persuade people to reduce global warming by cutting pollution.

Watch Gore describe what he calls a 'planetary emergency' » . Earlier Friday, a White House spokesman said President Bush was pleased that Gore, Bush's opponent in the 2000 presidential race, had won the award. ""Of course, he's happy for Vice President Gore, happy for the International Panel on Climate Change scientists, who also shared the Peace Prize,"" White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said. ""Obviously it's an important recognition, and we're sure the vice president is thrilled."" Fratto said Bush would not be under any pressure to adopt mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions, a policy Gore has advocated. Gore's ex-boss, former President Clinton, also said he's ""thrilled by this well-deserved recognition,"" and credited Gore with ""warning and educating us about the dangers of climate change for decades. He saw this coming before others in public life."" The Nobel committee's announcement cited Gore and the IPCC ""for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."" The award ceremony will be held December 10 in Oslo, Norway. In recent weeks, Gore has been the target of a campaign to persuade him to enter the 2008 presidential race. A source involved in Gore's past political runs told CNN that he definitely has the ambition to use the peace prize as a springboard to run for president. But he will not run, because he won't take on the political machine assembled by Sen. Hillary Clinton, said the source. If the senator from New York had faltered at all, Gore would take a serious look at entering the race, the source said. But Gore has calculated that Clinton is unstoppable, according to the source. Gore repeatedly denied he has any plans to run again, but this week a group of grass-roots Democrats calling themselves ""Draft Gore"" took out a full-page ad in The New York Times in a bid to change his mind. Watch Gore discuss global warming and politics . ""Your country needs you now, as do your party, and the planet you are fighting so hard to save,"" the group said in an open letter. ""America and the Earth need a hero right now, someone who will transcend politics as usual and bring real hope to our country and to the world."" The Nobel committee praised Gore as being ""one of the world's leading environmentalist politicians."" ""He is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted,"" said Ole Danbolt Mjos, chairman of the Nobel committee. In making the announcement, Mjos said, ""Through the scientific reports it has issued over the past two decades, the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. ""Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming."" Said Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the U.N. panel: ""This is an honor that goes to all the scientists and authors who have contributed to the work of the IPCC."" Renate Christ, secretary of the panel, called the award ""the most significant recognition that the IPCC has received."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in 1988 to study climate change information. The group doesn't do independent research but instead reviews scientific literature from around the world. The U.N.-sanctioned group was formed by the World Meteorological Organization and U.N. Environment Program. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""delighted"" with the news that Gore and the IPCC will share in prize. The Nobel caps a series of prestigious awards associated with Gore, including two  Oscars this year for the 2006 documentary film, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" which followed him on a worldwide tour publicizing the dangers of climate change. Last month, he also picked up an Emmy -- the highest award in U.S. television -- for ""Current TV."" The show, which Gore co-created, describes itself as a global television network giving viewers the opportunity to create and influence its programming. Previous American recipients of the peace prize include former Presidents Carter in 2002, Wilson in 1919 and Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. In 1973, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the award with North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. received the honor in 1964.  See more on 2007 Nobel winners » .

79,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It may look like an air mattress you might see lying around next to a swimming pool but in reality its function couldn't be less trivial. The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin could play a major role in saving lives in the developing world. The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin (SWDT) -- a new portable water purifier -- could be a major step forward in the fight against disease and mortality in the Third World. Eric Olsen, a San Francisco-based architect and the inventor of the SWDT believes the product could help eradicate the scourge of polluted water which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate claims over 1.5 million lives every year. Not only does it purify water -- up to 20 liters -- it makes it more portable in large quantities -- a vital dual role in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central Asia where access to clean water is often scarce. ""There are lots of products that do one or the other,"" Olsen told CNN. ""There's a really interesting product that's been around for 10 or 12 years called the Hippo Water Roller -- a 20 gallon drum with a handle attached that allows people -- mostly women -- to transport a week's worth of water back home"". Olsen also points to another product developed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) that has successfully tackled water impurities. According to Eawag SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection Process) is already used by more than two million in over 30 countries. ""The idea of SWDT,"" he says, ""is to combine these two products and make them into something that can do both roles effectively"". Made out of a top layer of recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a bottom layer of durable rubberized nylon, the SWDT is both flexible and robust. Its design was morphologically inspired by the saguaro cactus and is adaptable to a variety of situations -- as a wrap to carry or placed on the roof of a mud hut -- and is easy to store. The SWDT uses passive solar radiation -- a water sterilizing method approved by WHO -- which disrupts the reproduction of microorganisms. Heat and UVA radiation from the sun pass through the LDPE layer and into the water cavity and are reflected back by the bottom layer of nylon. On a sunny day purification takes five hours. Olsen admits that its performance is hampered by its low density -- scratches to the surface mean it doesn't transmit the sun's rays as effectively -- but he is confident that this can be overcome with more research. Production using a Radio Frequency Welding equipment may be relatively expensive but Olsen says that the raw materials are cheap and the labor is inexpensive. ""We are trying to imagine ways that this thing can be made and repaired by people where it is most needed,"" he said. ""We are working on a sheet welding process which is much lower tech, inexpensive and also capitalizes on the handcraft skills of local people"". What started out as a solo effort a little over a year ago has gradually grown into a collaborative project. Olsen's students at the California College of Arts, where he currently teaches -- he moves to a new post at Woodbury University this fall -- have lent their enthusiasm and experts from the bioscience and textile industries are increasingly coming on board. Olsen's efforts have already been recognized. The SWDT won first prize in the 2008 Next Generation Design Competition run by Metropolis Magazine -- netting him $10,000 -- and he is waiting for conformation that the invention has been selected for Wired Magazine's Next Fest show which takes place in Chicago later this year. So what next for Olsen and his invention? The aim is to adapt the original design and turn it from a water carrying wrap into a fully fledged coat and he's also looking at ways the material might be redrawn as a tent. He's currently in the process of trying to qualify for non-profit status. And with the likes of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other institutions out there, he thinks the prospects for funding development and deployment look promising.",0.62159616,7658
80,"(CNN) -- A salty soup of seawater, microscopic pieces of plastic and marine debris. Those are the ingredients in the North Pacific Gyre, an ocean vortex estimated by Greenpeace to be the size of Texas, contaminated with the floating detritus of our modern lives. The sheer size of the ocean area affected has been enough to catch public attention, but a number of concerned groups are aiming to capture more than that. Project Kaisei plans to find a way to scoop up the plastic waste and devise a way to turn it into a future fuel source. It's a huge task, but led by innovator and environmentalist Doug Woodring, Project Kaisei has already embarked on a mission to the gyre. An August voyage onboard the New Horizon and Kaisei sailing ships was in partnership with Scripps Research Institute. The crews returned with samples of the water from various locations in the gyre and the most immediate discovery was the pervasiveness of plastic material found at regular points over 3,500 miles. The most heavily polluted areas of surface water in the gyre contained six times more plastic than plankton biomass. Derelict, or ""ghost"" nets, plastic crates and even toys were found by the crew. Some items like plastic bottles had become impromptu homes to varieties of marine mollusc. As well as posing hazards to the oceans through toxic contamination and to sealife through ingestion or being trapped in nets, unnatural transport systems could allow invasive species to be introduced to different areas and upset delicate ecosystems. The project now counts scientists, innovators, sailors and environmentalists among its ranks, galvanized around a desire to clean up the Pacific's plastic vortex. A further voyage next year hopes to gather more data and move closer to a practical solution to the ever increasing problem.",0.621333,7012
81,"(CNN) -- Marjorye Heeney knew something was wrong when she saw a bulging cloud of black dust darken the sky. Drought-like conditions dried this Kern River bed last year near Bakersfield, California. She then heard an eerie, train-like whistle as fierce winds rattled her front door and windows. When she looked outside, hordes of grasshoppers and crows swarmed over her father's barren farm. After the storm broke, her father walked outside and muttered curses as he scanned the horizon for rain clouds. ""I can remember my dad just watching the sky so closely,"" Heeney says. ""A sprinkle would excite him so much."" That's how Heeney, now 83, describes growing up on an Oklahoma farm during the Dust Bowl storms in the 1930s. For much of that decade, ""black blizzards"" -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged much of the nation. Now a new generation of Americans is again anxiously looking to the sky. Drought has returned to the United States, and some warn that more tough days are ahead. The value of water is starting to become apparent in America. Over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the country, and conflicts over water usage may become commonplace in the future, climatologists say. ""Our focus is oil, but the critical need for water is going to make water the most significant natural resource that we're going to have to worry about in the future,"" says Larry Fillmer, executive director of the Natural Resources Management & Development Institute at Auburn University in Alabama. At least 36 states expect to face water shortages within the next five years, according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, several regions in particular have been hit hard: the Southeast, Southwest and the West. Texas, Georgia and South Carolina have suffered the worst droughts this year, the agency said. Yet most people don't need scientists to tell them there's a water shortage. Plenty of cities have implemented water bans while state squabbles over water usage are common in some regions. What may surprise people, though, are the causes for the recent drought. It's not global warming, some climatologists say. The droughts are caused by rapid population growth and unwise agricultural choices. John R. Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says the last three years have been drier than usual in many parts of the United States, but overall there's been no shortage of rainfall. He says the U.S. mainland experienced worse droughts in the 12th and 16th centuries. ""The demand for water has gone up,"" Christy says. ""The demand has skyrocketed in places like California and New Mexico because they've tried to grow crops in deserts."" Even drought conditions in the Southeast can't be blamed on a shortage of rainfall, Christy says. The region's water delivery systems can't keep pace with the growth, he says. ""The rain is still falling, but you're out of water because the storage facilities are not big enough,"" Christy says. There's also a public perception that ordinary people are wasting more water, but that's not true, says Mark Svoboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center. ""Per capita use of water is down because we're learning to be more efficient,"" Svoboda says. Water shortages don't have to remain a fact of modern life, drought experts say. Many offer the same solutions: Build better water delivery systems to accommodate population growth, develop more efficient uses of irrigation, and shift agriculture from the West to the East where it's easier and cheaper to water crops. Svoboda believes a change in attitude is even more vital than changing habits. ""We take water for granted,"" he says. ""We think it's a cheap commodity that's always going to be there."" Heeney, the Dust Bowl survivor, doesn't appear to need that lesson. She remembers how precious water was in the 1930s when people fetched water in buckets. And when the rains finally ended the Dust Bowl, she vividly remembers her joyous father driving his family out into his fields just to watch the water settle into the soil. Heeney, who now lives in Topeka, Kansas, gets upset when she sees people throw away bottled water or use too much water to wash their cars. ""We don't value water and we're going to regret it,"" Heeney says. ""We forget. We're as dumb as we can be and we don't learn.""",0.6175628,8131
82,"TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- After witnessing the rapid devastation of a Cayman Island coral reef where he had been diving since childhood, Todd Barber was moved from horror to action. He gave up a six-figure salary as a marketing consultant and dedicated his life to restoring the world's ocean reef ecosystems. ""I had been following this reef since I had been 14; it was where my first dive was,"" recalls Barber. ""When that one little tiny reef was lost, that sparked something in me. If we lost one and it took that tens of thousands of years to get here, how fast is this happening?"" Barber had caught a small glimpse of a larger global issue -- the destruction of the world's coral reefs -- and it scared him. According to the Nature Conservancy, if the present rate of destruction continues, 70 percent of the world's coral reefs will be destroyed by the year 2050. Not only are they home to 25 percent of all marine fish species, but the organization states that 500 million people rely on coral reefs for their food and livelihoods. So Barber and his father, a marine biologist and fellow diver, sat down to devise a solution to ""put the reef back."" What started as a basic idea to shape concrete around a beach ball led to three years of research, testing and prototyping with the help of friends and college professors.  Watch as Barber explains his passion for saving reefs » . ""Our goal was to mimic nature, not dictate nature,"" says Barber. ""And that meant that I couldn't come up with an idea; I had to design something that would fit exactly what the reef required."" The result was what Barber calls a ""Reef Ball."" Made of concrete engineered to last more than 500 years, Reef Balls are circular structures with a hollow center that serve as a base habitat upon which a natural reef can grow. Portable, inexpensive and environmentally friendly, according to Barber, Reef Balls can be built anywhere and are used to mimic and rehabilitate all forms of oceanic reefs, such as mangrove, oyster and coral reefs. They can also help control erosion and stabilize shorelines.  Watch as an organization in Tampa tries to restore habitats for oysters » . To manufacture and place Reef Balls in marine habitats around the world, Barber established The Reef Ball Foundation in 1993. Today, the non-profit organization works with environmental agencies, universities, community groups and corporations and empowers others to build and restore their local marine ecosystems. ""[Reefs] have an incredible bearing on human life,"" says Barber. ""Without conserving these resources, they're going to be all gone before we even know what we've lost."" According to Barber, marine conservation isn't just about Reef Balls, but they're one important tool. ""It's about saving natural reefs. It's about changing our behaviors,"" says Barber. ""It's better to save the reef that you have than to build a new one."" Since its inception, the Reef Ball Foundation has placed Reef Balls in more than 59 countries. ""For me, personally, the satisfaction comes from diving on a Reef Ball and seeing that the environment has been rehabilitated; that the reef is actually there,"" says Barber. ""And that our grandkids will be able to see the same thing."" E-mail to a friend .",0.61536133,306
83,"ON PUGET SOUND, Washington (CNN) -- When commercial diver Kenny Woodside takes to the depths, he enters a world of murky low light and dangerous currents. Diver Kenny Woodside descends to the murky depths to retrieve an abandoned net. Until recently Woodside and about 100 hundred other divers searched Puget Sound for sea cucumbers and urchins to sell to buyers in Asia, where the items are considered delicacies. But demand for the fishermen's catch dried up with the worldwide economic crisis and left many of these divers without a reason to go out on the water. ""The fishing industry has slowed from a full-time job to just a couple months a year,"" said Doug Monk, the captain of the boat from which Woodside dives. ""The red sea urchin market is almost non-existent."" But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets. While many stimulus projects have come under fire as pork barrel spending, backers of the nets program say it is a model for helping those battered by the economic downturn while completing needed public works. Thousands of the large nets stretch across the floor of Puget Sound, where they create an environmental hazard. Some of the nets were lost by fishermen to the rocky coastline decades ago but continue to catch and kill. According to the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, the nets are responsible for killing tens of thousands of marine life, mammals and birds every year. The nets, some of which extend larger than a football field, can also tangle the propellers of boats and pose a danger to scuba divers. After struggling to find funding, the group received $4.6 million in stimulus funds to recover most of the nets that litter the unique Puget Sound ecosystem. The only reason the nets have remained underwater for so long, said Ginny Broadhurst, director of the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, is because the damage they are doing to the environment is invisible from the surface. ""If you had nets strung along the streets that are catching bunny rabbits and squirrels, we wouldn't be discussing whether we should be removing them. We would be pulling them. It would be immediate,"" said Broadhurst. ""When those threats are underwater it's so much harder to know what impacts they are having."" But pulling those nets is no easy task. Divers swim close to 100 feet down to an environment that is anything but friendly. Instead of using scuba equipment, they breathe through air hoses running from the boat above. When the divers find the fields of nets, they begin the labor of cutting them free piece by piece and all by hand. Removing one net can take days.  Watch the divers at work » . The nets are then pulled to the boat waiting on the surface. In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets. Inside are the bones of countless fish and birds, along with several species of protected sharks and crabs. Anything still alive is cut free and thrown back in the water. Then, biologist Jeff June notes what they have brought up. So far, he says, the group has identified 112 distinct species trapped in the nets. The fishing nets themselves are considered toxic after the years of catching so much sea life. The divers seal them in heavy duty plastic bags and, once on shore, take the nets to a landfill. But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets. Over the next 18 months the group expects to pull some 3,000 nets from Puget Sound. And in that time the fishing industry could bounce back from its slump, allowing Doug Monk and his crew to return to catching urchins and sea cucumbers. But, the boat captain said, recovering the fishing nets has greater meaning than just riding out a rough economy. ""We feel we are doing a good thing,"" he said. ""[With] harvest diving we are taking from the resources; here we are giving them back.""",0.615196,5484
84,"GREENSBURG, Kansas (CNN) -- There are still piles of bricks and rubble on countless streets in Greensburg, Kansas, a year after a tornado demolished more than 90 percent of the town. On May 4, 2007, a ferocious twister blasted Greensburg, Kansas, killing 11 people in the town of 1,400. Yet what is happening in the city's rebuilding process may not only re-invent Greensburg but provide a model for ""green"" building everywhere. Just a week after the deadly tornado hit May 4, 2007, a similar idea sparked in the mayor, a representative from the governor's office and a nonprofit expert from a nearby town. The concept: If the whole town had to be rebuilt anyway, why not be bold and build it as a global example of conservation, energy efficiency and creativity? Daniel Wallach, the nonprofit specialist, soon got the green light to help residents and businesses start over in a project known as Greensburg GreenTown. ""Kansas is known for being very conservative,"" Wallach said.  Watch how the town went green » . ""My first order of business was to listen. What I heard were a lot of concerns about politicization and being associated with 'tree huggers.' I helped frame it with the people here in such a way they saw, this is their movement,"" he said. Fifth-generation Greensburg resident Anita Hohl joined the staff of Greensburg GreenTown as a Web specialist. ""I was pretty green to begin with. I used to get teased about being a tree hugger. Now it's 'the thing!' This has really brought us so much closer together. What you can accomplish when just a few people are working toward the same goal is amazing,"" she said. Her farming grandparents instilled the virtue of being energy-efficient. ""My grandma always put her clothes on the line, did her own gardening and re-used everything,"" Hohl said. Hohl and her husband, a daughter, a son, four cats, a dog and two birds are among the Greensburg residents in ""FEMAville,"" a cluster of mobile homes set up as temporary housing. The family hopes to break ground soon for their new house and move in by Thanksgiving. Although they have made the best of the cramped quarters, she says, there are some challenges. ""It sort of feels like living in a cheap motel! But it's a lot better than it could be. It's nice to have a place to be,"" she said. From the start, the GreenTown staff knew that getting the business community on board with the green plan was vital. And in rural America, there is no business that's more of a bedrock than the John Deere dealership. In Greensburg, that dealership has been in the Estes family for four generations. Their facility was wiped out by the twister. ""The building was a total loss. And we saved only 13 pieces of machinery out of 220 on the lot,"" Kelly Estes said. ""The FEMA guy said he had never seen anything like it. Steel twisted into brick, and then the miles per hour needed to pick up combines that weigh 25,000 pounds and move them half a mile in the air,"" he said. Kelly and his brother Mike decided to rebuild in town to the highest green-building standard. The U.S. Green Building Council establishes a rating system for efficient buildings called LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. The Greensburg facility is aiming for LEED platinum, the most demanding standard. There is one wind turbine on their new property, a 100-foot structure designed to generate 5 kilowatts of electricity. It is providing power for the construction site. Although ""green"" may be viewed as trendy and new by some, Mike Estes knows that it is not for show. ""We're looking at saving money here; truthfully, we are. We're running a business. If we can't make this make sense, why would we do it?"" he asked. And he says the non-political approach of the city in encouraging energy efficiency has helped. ""I don't think it's red or blue to be green; I think green is green, and green makes sense. And green saves you green!"" he said with a laugh. Being a model for the world in energy efficiency is a major goal of Greensburg GreenTown. But there is another even more urgent aim: keeping this rural town from disappearing. The lack of jobs in many small towns means that after teenagers graduate from high school, they have to leave to find other opportunities. ""The average age of people living in rural communities is in their 50s,"" Wallach said. ""There are very few folks in the communities under that age, because there are just no jobs. Families have been split up for decades."" So in addition to the long-term goal of Greensburg's pre-tornado businesses from leaving, people hope to attract new green trade as well. The city wants to open a biodiesel facility as one of its first green newcomers. Another long-term goal is to have 100 percent renewable energy. It is probable that the greatest contribution would come from large wind turbines. ""The timing of all this is, in some ways, almost spooky,"" Wallach said. ""It's like the world was ready for this to happen, for a town to be completely re-imagined. The tragedy was terrible. But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.""

85,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientists in the United States are developing a ""synthetic tree"" capable of collecting carbon around 1,000 times faster than the real thing. A conceptual design of how the ""synthetic tree"" might look should they ever reach the stage of production. As the wind blows though plastic ""leaves,"" the carbon is trapped in a chamber, compressed and stored as liquid carbon dioxide. The technology is similar to that used to capture carbon from flue stacks at coal-fired power plants, but the difference is that the ""synthetic tree"" can catch carbon anytime, anywhere. ""Half of your emissions come from small, distributed sources where collection at the site is either impossible or impractical,"" said Professor Klaus Lackner, Ewing-Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University. ""We aim for applications like gasoline in cars or jet fuel in airplanes. We are going after CO2 that otherwise is nearly impossible to collect,"" he told CNN. While the idea of carbon-catchers may sound far-fetched, an early model has been built and Lackner is in the process of writing a proposal for consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy. He personally explained the concept in a 45-minute meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last month at a three-day symposium on climate change in London. ""He was there and I was there and he showed interest,"" Lackner told CNN. ""That's exciting, but I don't particularly want to discuss this in a public forum because I think this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to tailor my proposals to the Department of Energy in a way that makes them more palatable."" Lackner started working on the concept of an ambient carbon catcher in 1998. ""I argued back then and I still argue that the reason this can be done, from a theoretical point of view, is that the CO2 in the air is actually surprisingly concentrated, therefore the device you need to collect CO2 is quite small."" The ""synthetic tree"" looks more like a public convenience block than a hi-tech method of reducing carbon emissions, but Lackner told CNN it is highly efficient for its size when compared, for example, to a modern power-generating wind turbine. ""If you give me one of those big windmills which have those big areas through which the rotor moves -- how much CO2 can I avoid? And if I had an equally sized CO2 collector -- how much CO2 can I collect? It turns out the collector is several hundred times better than the windmill."" Is the ""synthetic tree"" an interesting alternative, or a  scientific flight of fancy that's unlikely to happen? Sound Off below. Lackner told CNN that initial concerns over the cost of the technology were focused on the ""front-end"" carbon collector, including the sorbent used to catch the carbon dioxide in the air. But after years of research, Lackner told CNN he and his colleagues have developed a sorbent that is ""close to the ideal,"" in that it uses a relatively small amount of energy to release the CO2 and is not prohibitively expensive. ""By the time we make liquid CO2 we have spent approximately 50 kilojoules [of electricity] per mole of CO2."" Compare that, Lackner said, to the average power plant in the U.S. which produces one mole of CO2 with every 230 kilojoules of electricity. ""In other words, if we simply plugged our device in to the power grid to satisfy its energy needs, for every roughly 1000 kilograms [of carbon dioxide] we collected we would re-emit 200, so 800 we can chalk up as having been successful,"" he said. Lackner told CNN the biggest cost was at the ""back-end"" of the collector, primarily the technology used to release the CO2 from the sorbent. He said for that reason, on a cost-basis, the ""synthetic tree"" could not compete with modern coal-fired power plants that are designed to release fewer carbon emissions than their older predecessors. But he said when compared to the cost of retro-fitting an existing coal plant, the ""synthetic tree"" becomes more viable. ""The bottom line is we have in this way the ability to deal with the problem at a cost which is somewhat higher than on a coal-fired power plant retro-fit, but not much higher."" Besides, he said, the technology is not being developed as an alternative to the carbon capture and storage methods currently being tested for large-scale use on coal-fired power stations. He's targeting carbon that's already in the air. The concept of the ""synethic tree"" has caught the imagination of one of the first scientists to warn the world about global warming, Lackner's colleague at Columbia University, Newberry Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Professor Wally Broecker. ""I'm extremely excited about this. I think this is something that the world's going to have to have, unfortunately,"" Broecker told CNN from Madrid where he received a BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work on the issue of climate change. Broecker told CNN most people still don't recognize the magnitude of the task the world faces in reducing global carbon emissions, and it was likely that one day urgent action would need to be taken, above and beyond the current measures being discussed. ""We're probably not going to stop CO2 rising until it's double what it was near-1800 and maybe even more than that,"" he said. ""I think we will find that the planet is too warm, ice is melting too fast... and we'll want to bring the CO2 back down again. The only way we can do that on a short timescale would be to pull it back out of the atmosphere."" Broecker told CNN the units could stand in the middle of Australia, for example, and their presence wouldn't significantly disrupt the atmospheric distribution. ""Each unit would take out a ton of CO2 a day -- which would be the amount of CO2 produced by 20 average automobiles in the U.S.A. And the cost of each unit would be about the cost of a Toyota. So that would mean if you added a five percent surcharge on automobile purchases that money could go to building units to remove the CO2 those vehicles are going to create.""",0.61367583,9180

When self-confessed ""nature nerd"" Janine Benyus coined the term ""biomimicry"" in a book she published a decade ago, little did she know it would make her into an household name, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood stars.

The natural sciences writer now gives talks on the subject to riveted crowds and is a consultant to some of world's biggest  companies. In her capacity as  ""biologist at the design table,"" Janine helps companies like Nike and Hewlett Packard to innovate and improve their designs by using what already exists in nature. She also appeared as a consultant in the apocalyptic environmental documentary ""11th Hour,"" produced by Leonardo DiCaprio last year. Janine coined the term ""biomimicry"" from the Greek ""bios,"" meaning ""life,"" and ""mimesis,"" meaning ""imitate."" ""It was a surprise to me when the phone started ringing after my book came out in 1997,"" she told CNN. ""It was companies and individual inventors, companies that were inventing everyday and they had problems to solve. They said, 'gee the book is fabulous, it's about all this science that's happening in early stage research. But we're doing innovation in real time. Can you come and be a biologist at the design table?"" So far, using nature's design genius has led to the creation of bat-inspired ultrasonic canes for the blind, synthetic sheets that collect water from mist and fog as desert beetles do, and paint that self-cleans like a lotus leaf. Scientists are also working on making solar cells like leaves and supertough ceramics that resemble the inner shells of abalone, which is twice as durable as the ceramics used in jet engines. Before Janine wrote her book, there wasn't even a word to describe the work of a few scattered scientists looking for inspiration through nature in different corners of the world. History is, of course, littered with examples of humans copying nature's design. One of the most notable was invented by the Swiss engineer George de Mestral. Whilst out walking his dog one day de Mestral became annoyed by the burrs catching and sticking to his clothes and in his dog's fur. He decided to study them under a microscope. The magnification revealed a network of tiny hooks. The product of his labors was Velcro, which was patented in 1951. At the core of Janine's beliefs is that nature has already spent 3.8 billion years on research and development. Its failures are now fossils. She believes its successes contain strategies the human race can copy in its quest for a sustainable future. Janine has cultivated a deep knowledge of the natural world, beginning with direct observation in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, continuing in habitats from Maine to West Virginia where she worked as a backcountry guide, and now, in her home wilds of Montana. She graduated summa cum laude from Rutgers University, New Jersey, with two degrees in Natural Resource Management and English Literature/Writing. Named by Time magazine as an environmental hero of 2007, she's now writing the sequel book, ""Nature's 100 Best Technologies,"" and also consults through her firm The Biomimicry Guild, which came about following the massive demand for her knowledge. ""From interiors, manufacturing everything from apparel to transportation to bath and kitchen and carpets and furniture and sneakers, and even cities,"" she told CNN. ""I'd be talking to groups of mayors and talking to the European parliament, policy makers and they all wanted to know how can we learn from nature how to design a more sustainable world."" ""They want to know if there are blue prints, and of course there are. And they said 'great, bring over your biologists."" One of the companies that Janine has worked with is Interface, Inc, the world's largest commercial carpet manufacturer . The process is particularly hard on the environment as it uses petrochemicals in every step and consumes vast amounts of energy, and produces tons of waste. But after working with Janine and the Guild, Interface  introduced Entropy, a carpet inspired by random pattern formation in nature. It was a greener product that gave customers more flexibility as they could replace individual tiles instead of the whole carpet. Entropy quickly rose to become Interface's top-selling line of carpet and still represents 40 percent of their carpet tile sales.

87,"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday urged urban leaders and policymakers they need to take the lead now in fighting climate change. Bill Clinton to urban leaders in Seoul: What will you do about climate change? ""What are you going to do and how much are you going to spend?"" Clinton asked leaders from the world's biggest cities at a climate summit being held in South Korea's capital, Seoul. Officials from the world's 40 biggest cities plus 17 affiliate municipalities are attending the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which ends on Thursday. Waiting for nations to take the lead with a new climate protocol in Copenhagen in December is not an option, said David Miller, mayor of Toronto and chairman of the C40 Cities Leadership Group. ""If governments talk about reducing CO2 (carbon dioxide), cities are the ones that show how it's done,"" Miller said. ""The point is that cities act, and working together we have a scale and a size that we dramatically increase people's ability to fight climate change. ""The challenge for national governments is that while they can sometimes reach agreement they don't know how to act collectively,"" Miller continued. ""For cities, that's easier. We all have climate strategies, but can make our actions work better and make the partnerships to do that."" The Seoul summit is the third conference by cities held to discuss responses to climate change. The C40 group was established in London in 2005. A second summit was held in New York in 2007.  Watch efforts to make New York's Empire State Building more eco-friendly » . Much of the talk at this week's conference was how major urban centers could work toward adhering to the Kyoto Protocol, the existing environmental treaty that sets targets for nations to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. Adopted in December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force in February 2005. In countries that did not sign up to the Kyoto agreement, cities took it upon themselves to reduce their carbon footprint. While the United States did not sign Kyoto, 825 U.S. cities and towns signed up to a climate protection agreement that embraced that protocol's goals. Some nations that signed Kyoto have set more ambitious environmental targets. Copenhagen, for example, aims to be the world's first carbon neutral capital by 2025. Toronto, like other cities, will be sending a city delegation to Copenhagen for the U.N. summit in December. There to lobby governments and for a parallel cities summit, Miller hopes that the actions that cities are taking now, and the partnership that he expects to be made while in Seoul this week, will serve as examples that the carbon reduction goals can be reached. ""Copenhagen is very important for all countries to agree, because we are losing the battle. Cities will be there and we're going to be very active. We'll have credibility because we are actually doing things. We'll be able to say to governments that they need to engage, empower and resource cities so we can accomplish the goals."" How to actually reduce CO2 emissions is the purpose of the Seoul summit, Clinton reminded delegates. Representing around 600 million people worldwide, mayors and policymakers in Seoul have the ability to make a difference with climate change policies, the former U.S. president added. If the methods of reducing a city's carbon footprint are known there is still the question of the means, which vary wildly between the first world urban areas such as Seoul, London and Toronto, and other attendees from cities in the developing world, such as Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Lagos, Nigeria. Miller believes that providing good examples of effective climate change policies and grasping the opportunity for cities to take the lead in planning for a low-carbon future should not be missed. He highlighted Toronto's own ""tower renewal"" project, retrofitting buildings in a run-down area of town that he hopes will be an example of a carbon-neutral urban renewal project that can be applicable elsewhere. New building projects in two areas of London and the creation of a new city in central Florida -- Destiny -- were among 16 projects announced at the summit as climate-positive initiatives and supported by the Clinton Climate Initiative. Once built, these projects will absorb more CO2 than they use, supporters claimed. Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon introduced the South Korean capital's ambitious environmental plans, including building a vast path of park land bisecting the capital. Delegates cited practical challenges they are facing. The spread of the H1N1 virus had crippled Mexico City's economy by scaring off tourists, officials from that city said at the summit. Without money, they said, even the most promising environmental plans can struggle. Luis Castaneda Lossio, the mayor of Lima, Peru, highlighted the initiatives his city is trying to pursue. Compared to Seoul's thousands of acres of parkland, he admitted they had struggled to plant 150 trees in the traffic-clogged city. ""Solidarity is essential!"" Lossio said with verve as a final remark during his address on making Lima a low-carbon city. It was a sentiment echoed by Miller, who highlighted the opportunities for cities such as Toronto to take a lead during the global economic recession. ""I've always believed in activist governments. The private sector is in retreat. The green agenda is a way to restart the economy by doing the right thing. If there are ways for the governments to create incentives, like grants for solar power, then you can kick-start the economy on the right path, but cities and government importantly have to do that now. We have a great opportunity.""",0.6129662,4050
88,"TILCARA, Argentina (CNN) -- Carmen Salva's mission may be ambitious, but her belief is simple: ""It's never too early to start caring for the land you live in and grow up in."" Carmen Salva: ""It's a great joy to know that I am preparing a new generation to respect the environment."" That's why on Saturdays, Salva and a group of 60 to 100 students, parents and teachers can be found venturing into the high altitude of their northern Argentina mountains, trash bags in hand and llamas in tow. They're part of Esperanza de Vida (Hope for Life), Salva's youth environmental group that is out to clean up the surroundings, one plastic bottle at a time. Salva, 49, was born and raised in the Jujuy province of northern Argentina, an area known for its rich culture and spectacular vistas -- ""the reason why most people fall in love with it,"" says Salva. But despite its beauty, Salva says there's no real environmental consciousness in her community. ""We have a lot of issues to work on -- the problem of water contamination; there's so much trash,"" Salva says. ""We can't just think that it will take care of itself."" Salva, who has been a teacher in Jujuy for 20 years, says the environmental issues aren't recent ones. Ten years ago, she and her students noticed a lot of trash outside the school. ""The parks surrounding the school were littered with plastic bottles and beer bottles,"" recalls Salva. They began volunteering with a government program, collecting and bagging waste in the area. But the program waned after a year, and students and teachers could no longer continue their environmental efforts. ""Our city had no formal recycling program or even knowledge of why it was important to learn about fresh water, forestation, and the importance of recycling,"" says Salva. So Salva began Esperanza de Vida in 1997 to organize and lead young participants in ""making our streets and our environment cleaner."" ""I believe that change begins with the youth,"" says Salva. ""They will teach future generations how to care for nature and everything that surrounds us."" At first, the group's activities were limited to cleaning parks near and around the school. But the organization's efforts have expanded well beyond the immediate area, and other Jujuy schools have joined in. About 150 people now take part, including about 80 children. Salva says her students are deeply impacted by the ""Pachamama"" concept, or caring for Mother Earth.  She and fellow teachers have noticed their students apply as much energy and commitment to the weekend environmental activities as they do to their general subjects. ""Some even wait by my house on Saturday for the program to begin,"" beams Salva. The group convenes early in the morning to hike together into the mountains, where they work for hours, picking up trash and separating recyclables.  Watch Salva talk about her program's impact on the students and their environment » . ""We have long days and we accomplish a lot. It gets tiring because it's a lot of walking and sometimes there are cliffs,"" says Salva. ""[But] the students enjoy it a lot. They're making changes while having fun."" On an average Saturday cleanup, it's not unusual for the group to collect roughly 60 bags of trash for recycling, clearing thousands of bottles from the mountains. The llamas help carry the heavy load down from the mountains. ""The children call them the little eco-llamas.""  Watch Salva discuss another way the llamas help her group in the mountains » . The local government has also pitched in, helping to provide transport of the collected recyclables to the drop-off center, located nearly 50 miles from Tilcara.

89,"(CNN) -- SeaWorld will resume killer whale shows while the company and two federal agencies investigate the death of a whale trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, company and federal officials announced Friday. The shows, which were suspended at all SeaWorld locations after the death Wednesday at SeaWorld Orlando, will resume Saturday with new precautionary measures in place, said Jim Atchison, president of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. Earlier Friday, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced they were looking into the death of Dawn Brancheau, 40. Brancheau was pulled underwater when a killer whale named Tilikum grabbed her ponytail. A source at SeaWorld said that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Trainers eventually had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later. WESH: Watch tourist's video just before attack . A former head of animal training said Friday that Brancheau left herself vulnerable to attack and that she may have broken the park's training protocol. ""Dawn, if she was standing here right now, would tell you that that was her mistake in allowing that to happen,"" said former SeaWorld trainer Thad Lacinak, who had worked with Brancheau in the past, on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Lacinak called Brancheau ""one the best killer whale trainers I ever worked with."" Still, he said, Brancheau should not have been lying in a slideout -- a platform covered by roughly 4 inches of water -- so close to a killer whale. ""When I was there we did have a protocol that you would not do that, you would not lie down in a slideout and get that close to his mouth. ""Now, whether she broke that protocol or not I don't know, or if the protocol changed in how they were working with him,"" Lacinak continued. ""But I'm pretty sure it was her breaking the protocol."" Atchison said Friday that it's too soon to tell if Brancheau violated protocol. ""It's far too early to get to that point,"" the SeaWorld president said. ""We're really still trying to collect information, trying to understand the nature and scope of the event."" He declined to discuss SeaWorld's training protocols, saying they are ""proprietary documents."" Atchison had high praise for Brancheau and said a charitable foundation is being formed to support causes she was interested in. He told reporters that video images in connection with the accident have been made available to the appropriate authorities. Atchison said Tilikum ""is a wonderful animal"" and ""will remain an active and contributing member of the team despite what happened."" ""He's a very special animal that requires special handling. Obviously the procedures that we've had in place are something we're revisiting at this point,"" he said. Tilikum's size and weight -- 12,000 pounds, compared with 6,000 to 9,000 pounds for the facility's other killer whales -- was one reason there were separate procedures in place for him at the Orlando facility. When the shows with killer whales resume Saturday at Orlando and other SeaWorld parks, trainers won't get into the water with the animals. ""Direct interactions"" with the animals were suspended in all three SeaWorld parks after the death. Various other improvements and changes will be enacted, Atchison said. iReport: Photo taken moments before attack . Labor Department spokesman Mike Wald said the safety and health agency is looking into whether OSHA workplace standards were violated in the incident. It will complete a report within six months, he said. If workplace infractions are found, OSHA will propose financial penalties, Wald said. If that happens, the company could accept the penalties and make any necessary workplace changes or appeal proposed penalties before an OSHA review commission. David Sacks, Agriculture Department spokesman, said inspectors are looking into the incident from the animal welfare perspective. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service wants to know if there were any violations of the Animal Welfare Act, a federal set of minimum-care standards for entities that get USDA licenses, including facilities that exhibit warm-blooded mammals to the public. Sacks said the incident will trigger a ""focused"" investigation, in which inspectors will go to SeaWorld to gather facts. If they think any welfare-act violations contributed to the incident, a formal investigation will begin. Such violations could trigger fines and even license suspensions and revocations. ""If we feel animals are suffering, we can confiscate the animal,"" Sacks said. He said SeaWorld Orlando has never been the object of a penalty enforcement. In a video posted on SeaWorld's blog, Chuck Tompkins, head of animal training for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, mourned Brancheau's death and raised the issue of safety standards. ""We need to evaluate our safety procedures and how we interact with these animals,"" he said, and he stressed that it's ""extremely important that we continue to take care of these animals the best way possible."" The same whale was linked previously to two other deaths. Tilikum and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a Victoria, British Columbia, marine park in 1991. The trainer fell into the whale tank at Sealand of the Pacific and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank. Nancy Black, a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years, said Tilikum could have been trying to play with Brancheau or get her attention or companionship. Such whales play with seals and sea lions in the wild, tossing them in the air, she said, but end up letting them go. But she said the whale could also have been frustrated for some reason. The incident raises larger questions about the captivity of wild animals. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said dolphins and other sea animals in aquariums ""routinely die prematurely of stress and other captivity-related causes,"" and human casualties also occur. The incident occurred about 2 p.m. Wednesday. Tompkins said the whale had just finished a session with Brancheau, who was leaning over and rubbing his head. They were in knee-deep water, he said. ""She had a long ponytail that brushed in front of her and apparently got in front of his nose,"" Tompkins said. ""He probably felt it."" Tilikum grabbed the ponytail and pulled Brancheau into the water, he said. Rescuers were not immediately able to reach her because the whale was too aggressive, the sheriff's office said. She was recovered by SeaWorld staff members after Tilikum was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank, authorities said. iReport: Dawn Brancheau performing at SeaWorld in June 2009 . Brancheau had wanted to be an animal trainer from the time she visited SeaWorld as a 9-year-old, her sister Diane Gross said. ""It was her dream job,"" Gross said. ""She loved the animals like they were her own children. ... She loved what she did.""",0.6116617,9448
90,"(CNN) -- A small town in Maryland is setting a precedent in eco-friendly road construction, breaking ground this week on one of the greenest streets in the nation. The tiny port town of Edmonston in Prince George's County is billing the thoroughfare as the greenest on the East Coast. The road will help clean and filter toxic storm water pollution that drains into rivers, and eventually into Chesapeake Bay. ""What we're hoping to do, from top to bottom, is build a street that is completely environmentally sustainable, "" said Edmonston Mayor Adam Ortiz. Ortiz says the blueprint incorporates native tree cover to cool off the streets, wind-powered street lights that use high-efficiency LED bulbs, and pedestrian and bicycle access . But most important, says Ortiz, is the plan for all that water that rolls down the streets when it rains. ""[It's] not going to be flushed into our local rivers. Instead it's going to be naturally filtered. And that's very important for us to save our rivers and to help save the Chesapeake Bay here in Maryland."" Storm water runoff often carries toxins and pollution from parking lots and city streets, and from farms and agricultural lands in rural areas. Most cities and towns have underground concrete drain systems that collect the runoff and dump it into rivers and streams, pollutants and all. ""What we're going to do, instead, is divert that water into natural gardens. To the naked eye it just looks like a regular garden, but actually it's very specially engineered to absorb a lot of water and naturally filter it before it gets into the water table, and to keep it from washing all those pollutants into the river,"" according to Ortiz. The storm water runoff in Edmonston drains into the nearby Anacostia River, which feeds into the Washington Channel, then empties into the Potomac River and eventually Chesapeake Bay. The eco-street project includes using porous bricks in building the road and creating bioretention cells or rain gardens. The idea is to trap the polluted runoff water, sending it through natural filter systems so that when it makes it into the Anacostia, it's a lot cleaner. Maryland Department of the Environment Deputy Secretary Robert Summers hopes this new main street in Edmonston is just the first of many. ""This kind of green infrastructure project to reduce storm water and energy consumption is exactly the kind of thing we need to do around the bay watershed to reduce pollution."" Summers says the benefits of this project are twofold: a reduction in storm water pollution and, through the energy efficiency in powering lighting, a reduction in air pollution and fallout. But how much can converting one street really help in cleaning up an area the size of the Chesapeake Bay? Summers acknowledges this is just the beginning. ""We need to grow it by leaps and bounds."" The Edmonston green street project is funded by the Environmental Protection Agency through a $1.1 million Recovery Act grant. Summers says the state of Maryland has already allocated $20 million for other green projects and that this is the first of many projects. The District of Columbia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania are also reviewing this green technology to eventually help do their part to clean up Chesapeake Bay. And in the Northwest, Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, have already taken steps to clean and control polluted storm water runoff. ""Our goal is that other towns and cities and communities will steal our ideas,"" Edmonston Mayor Ortiz said. ""We'll know we're successful when we see these technologies used in other places.""",0.61116195,8746
91,"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) -- Over the railroad tracks, near Agriculture Drive on the University of Georgia campus, sits a unique machine that may hold one of the solutions to big environmental problems like energy, food production and even global climate change. Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes. ""This machine right here is our baby,"" said UGA research engineer Brian Bibens, who is one of a handful of researchers around the world working on alternative ways to recycle carbon. Bibens' specialty is ""biochar,"" a highly porous charcoal made from organic waste. The raw material can be any forest, agricultural or animal waste. Some examples are woodchips, corn husks, peanut shells, even chicken manure. Bibens feeds the waste -- called ""biomass"" -- into an octagonally shaped metal barrel where it is cooked under intense heat, sometimes above 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the organic matter is cooked through a thermochemical process called ""pyrolysis"". In a few hours, organic trash is transformed into charcoal-like pellets farmers can turn into fertilizer.  Gasses given off during the process can be harnesed to fuel vehicles of power electric generators.  Watch how biochar is made and why it's important » . Biochar is considered by many scientists to be the ""black gold"" for agriculture. Its high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground. Biochar helps clean the air two ways: by preventing rotting biomass from releasing harmful CO2 into the atmosphere, and by allowing plants to safely store CO2 they pull out of the air during photosynthesis.  See more about how biochar works » . ""Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere,"" said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar. ""It gives us a chance to produce carbon negative energy."" Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen. Global carbon levels in the air have been steadily increasing at an alarming rate since the 1980s, according to NOAA. Since 2000, increases of 2 parts per million of CO2 have been common, according to NOAA. During the 1980s rates increased by 1.5 ppm per year. The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products. Some of the gases given off during the process can be converted to electricity, others can be condensed and converted to gasoline, and there are also some pharmaceutical applications for the by-products, said Danny Day President and CEO of Eprida, a private firm in Athens, Georgia currently exploring industry applications for the biochar process. Although scientists look to biochar to improve the future, its origin lies in the past. For centuries indigenous South Americans living in the Amazon Basin used a combination of charred animal waste and wood to make ""terra preta,"" which means black earth, in Portuguese. Thousands of years later, the terra preta soil remains fertile without need for any added fertilizer, experts say. ""These terra preta soils are older than 500 years and they are still black soil and very rich in carbon,"" said Steiner, a professor at the University of Georgia. Reducing the need for deforestation to create more cropland. By using biochar concepts, terra preta soils have been proven to remain fertile for thousands of years, preventing further harmful deforestation for agricultural purposes. But still more large-scale tests need to be conducted before biochar technology can be rolled out on a global scale. Day says biomass -- that otherwise would be thrown away --could be developed into entirely new markets for biofuels, electricity, biomass extracts and pharmaceutical applications, in addition to biochar. ""We have 3 billion people out there who are at risk for climate change and they can be making money solving our global problem,"" said Day. Industries can now begin to look at farmers around the world and pay them for their agricultural wastes, said Day. ""They can become the new affluent.""",0.61039853,5151
92,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Rare images of an African animal so elusive that it was once believed to be mythical have been released. One of the first pictures of the elusive okapi was taken by camera trap. The okapi is a shy animal related to the giraffe, with zebra-like stripes on its rear. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Africa but is now known to live only in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Okapis were last seen in the DRC 50 years ago, and the images are the first to capture the animal in the wild. ""To have captured the first-ever photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing,"" said Noelle Kumpel, manager of the Bushmeat and Forests Conservation Program at the Zoological Society of London, which took the pictures. ""Okapi are very shy and rare animals, which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence."" The okapi's face and long legs resemble those of the giraffe, their closest-living relative, but they look more like horses with long necks. The average height of their shoulders is 1.6 meters (5 feet, 3 inches), the ZSL says. They have a short, dense, velvety coat and dark prehensile tongue long enough to clean their own eyelids and ears. The new pictures show the okapi in the foliage of the DRC's Virunga National Park, where decades of economic collapse and armed conflict have threatened the diverse wildlife. In one image, an okapi looks curiously toward the camera amid the green trees and groundcover. Its large ears, dark nose, and zebra stripes are clearly visible. The next shot shows the okapi walking away from the camera, giving a clear view of its striking black-and-white stripes on its rear legs. A third image released by ZSL was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal. ""The photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear, which act like unique fingerprints,"" said Theirry Lusenge, a key member of ZSL's survey team in the DRC. ""We have already identified three individuals, and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the park, which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts."" ZSL said the images prove the okapi still thrives in the park despite threats to its survival, which include poaching, deforestation, military camps inside the park, and the influx of refugees at the park's borders. The animal's exact status is still a mystery, however, and it remains under threat, the ZSL said. Okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of Beni -- and if hunting continues at the same rate, okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years, the ZSL said. The Virunga National Park is one of only three protected areas the okapi are known to inhabit, the ZSL said. The ZSL's study of the okapi is part of a larger EU-funded conservation project in the park. Though focused on okapi, the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers, a kind of antelope, a ZSL spokeswoman said. The study involved 18 cameras set up around the park by the ZSL and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation, the spokeswoman said. The announcement comes a month after another group of researchers reported finding thousands of previously-unknown gorillas in the neighboring Republic of Congo. The U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society said in August they had found 125,000 Western lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern Congo, adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species. Okapi were well known by Africans for centuries but the animal remained elusive, thanks to its acute hearing and effective camouflage, according to The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa. Nineteenth-century explorers sometimes caught a fleeting glimpse of the okapi's striped backside as it ran through the forest, leading to speculation that it was a kind of zebra, the National Zoological Gardens says. It was known to the pygmy as a sacred animal. Still, the okapi remained unknown to the Western world until the early 20th century, when British explorer Harry Johnston went to Congo and sent a complete skin and skull back to Britain, the ZSL said.",0.60960263,928
93,"MARATHON, Florida (CNN)  -- Juan Lopez reads meters with one eye and looks for snakes with the other. Lopez is a member of the ""Python Patrol,"" a team of utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police trying to keep Burmese pythons from gaining a foothold in the Florida Keys. Members of the Python Patrol show off a giant snake that stretched more than 20 feet. Officials say the pythons -- which can grow to 20 feet long and eat large animals whole -- are being ditched by pet owners in the Florida Everglades, threatening the region's endangered species and its ecosystem. ""Right now, we have our fingers crossed that they haven't come this far yet, but if they do, we are prepared,"" Lopez said. Burmese Pythons are rarely seen in the middle Florida Keys, where Lopez works. The Nature Conservancy wants to keep it that way.  Watch huge python wrap around a CNN reporter » . The Python Patrol program was started by Alison Higgins, the Nature Conservancy's Florida Keys conservation manager. She describes it as an ""early detection, rapid response"" program made up of professionals who work outside. Eight Burmese pythons have been found in the Keys. ""If we can keep them from spreading and breeding, then we're that much more ahead of the problem,"" Higgins said. Utility workers, wildlife officials and police officers recently attended a three-hour class about capturing the enormously large snakes. Lt. Jeffrey L. Fobb of the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Venom Response Unit taught the participants how to capture pythons. ""There's no immutable laws of snake catching. It's what works,"" Fobb said as he demonstrated catching a snake with hooks, bags, blankets and his hands. ""We're doing it in the Florida Keys because we have a lot to protect,"" Higgins said. ""The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here."" Where the snakes are breeding is just north of the Keys in Everglades National Park. An estimated 30,000 Burmese pythons live in the park. The Everglades, known as the ""River of Grass,"" is a vast area with a climate perfect for these pythons to hide and breed. And breed they do: The largest clutches of eggs found in the Everglades have numbered up to 83. The snakes grow like they're on steroids. With a life span of 30 years, these pythons can weigh as much as 200 pounds. And the larger the snake, the bigger the prey. Biologists have found endangered wood rats, birds, bobcats and other animals in their stomachs. Two 5-foot-long alligators were found in the stomachs of Burmese pythons that were caught and necropsied, officials say. Officials also say Burmese pythons can travel 1.6 miles a day by land, and they can swim to reach areas outside the Everglades. This nonvenomous species was brought into the United States from Southeast Asia. Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar says biologists believe that well-intended pet owners are to blame for their introduction into the Everglades. ""These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,"" she said. Higgins says 99,000 of the popular pets were brought into the United States from 1996 to 2006, the most recent data available. She says they are an easy species to breed, and you can buy a hatchling for as little as $20. The problem with these pets, Friar says, is that they get too big for their owners to handle. Making the owner aware of what to expect when the animal becomes full-grown is a priority. ""The pet trade is pretty supportive in educating people,"" Friar said. She hopes a ""Don't let it loose"" message campaign makes an impact on pet owners. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, a supporter of restoring the Everglades, has introduced a bill that would ban importing the python species into the United States. The senator saw the need after learning about the effect these snakes were having on the park. ""Finding out many endangered species are being found in the stomach of the python,"" Nelson spokeswoman Susie Quinn said, ""we need to do a better job at protecting the resources."" In the meantime, Lopez and the Python Patrol will continue to protect the Florida Keys by capturing the snakes and turning them over to biologists to perform necropsies. The Nature Conservancy plans to expand the program to all the areas that surround the Everglades, making these predators their prey. ""I would like to find them and get rid of them,"" Lopez said.",0.60896623,3078
94,"DOUGLAS, Arizona (CNN) -- It's a tale of homeland security concerns blocking wildlife management, and the hue and cry that ensues. This photo, taken by Warner Glenn in 1996, is believed to be the first of a live jaguar in the United States. When most people think of jaguars, they think of the jungles of Central and South America, not the remote desert ranges between the United States and Mexico. That region is known as mountain lion country, and that's what rancher Warner Glenn thought he was tracking when he saddled up his mules on a summer day 12 years ago near Douglas, Arizona. Glenn has hunted mountain lions for 60 years, since he was eight years old. But Glenn was stunned when he saw what his hunting dogs had chased up to a high mountain perch. The rancher took what's believed to be the first photo of a live jaguar in the United States. But it wasn't his last. In 2006, some 40 miles away, Glenn and his hunting party again cornered a jaguar -- a different one. Jaguars, an endangered species, have a breeding population in northern Mexico. Scientists believe there are no more than 120 left in the wild there. It's believed that since 1910, the cats are only visitors north of the border. They have been virtually unstudied here until recently. But Glenn and other conservationists worry that the possible return of breeding jaguars to the United States could be stopped in its tracks. The reason: the border fence. Last month the Department of Homeland Security waived 30 environmental laws to finish 470 miles of the fence by the end of the year. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told Congress that the agency continues to talk to some 600 landowners along the border to get their input. But in order to comply with the congressional mandate, he said, there is no time to deal with ""unnecessary delays caused by administrative processes or potential litigation."" ""We are currently in a lawless situation at the border,"" says Chertoff. ""I feel an urgency to get this tactical infrastructure in. And although we're going to be respectful of the environment, we're going to be expeditious."" Two environmental groups, Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club, have filed appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming the waivers are unconstitutional and set a dangerous precedent. ""National security and environmental protection do not have to be at odds with each other,"" says Defenders of Wildlife spokesman Matt Clark. ""If we can drop this arbitrary deadline for constructing the fence and go through the proper procedures, then there are inevitably ways to minimize environmental impact, but as it is now it's throwing all of those laws out the window."" Mountain lion tracker Jack Childs also worries about the impact of the fence on local wildlife, especially the jaguar. Childs captured the first video of a live jaguar in the late summer of 1996, a few months after Warner Glenn.  Watch Childs and Glenn talk about efforts to preserve the jaguar » . ""I knew historically there had been a few jaguars sighted in Arizona but in the last hundred years never in any numbers."" His encounter sparked a passion for the big cats. Along with wife Anna and biologist Emil McCain, he created the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project.  See images of the controversy » . Childs and McCain hike into remote mountain areas where the jaguars roam and have placed more than 50 motion sensor cameras near the border. They've taken 69 photos of three different jaguars since 2001, including several of the same cat Childs first saw in 1996. He has nicknamed that cat Macho B. A jaguar's spots are like fingerprints -- each cat has a unique set. One of the spots on Macho B resembles a Pinocchio cartoon figure, and that's how they identify him. ""We spend a lot of time walking along the border during the daytime, and we actually find his tracks going through the fence, so we know for sure that he crosses back and forth,"" says Childs. ""A fence like that is going to inhibit wildlife movements and migrations back and forth. It's not going to effectively stop human traffic. They've got wire cutters and torches.""  See where the jaguars have been spotted » . Childs says the fence also has an impact on wildlife because drug runners and human traffickers have been pushed up into the mountain areas to avoid the fence in the lowland valleys. ""It's impacting the animals number one, what's going on down there. It's almost brought my wildlife study to a stop because they (the traffickers) are tearing down my cameras as fast as I'm putting them up because they think we're taking pictures of them."" The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finds itself in a unique position. Its mission is wildlife and habitat protection, but it must uphold another federal agency's mission to override environmental concerns. Bill Radke, manager of the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge, says the Border Patrol is trying to work with his agency. ""The hope is that by working with Border Patrol that we can meet the national security mandate and at the same time protect the wildlife,"" says Radke. ""Border Patrol is putting up camera towers but are putting them up on areas that are off the refuge. They're working on barriers but not barriers that would impede wildlife and large animals like jaguars."" At 6 foot 6, with steely blue eyes, dressed in leather chaps astride his mule, rancher Warner Glenn is every inch the American cowboy. And he is a man forever changed by his encounters with the jaguar. He has written a book, ""Eyes of Fire,"" about his experience. He says he'd like to ""invite Mr. Bush to come out on a mule"" so he can see ""what's going on here in these mountains."" For Glenn, the cat represents all that is wild about the Southwest. ""It would be a loss to me that maybe my granddaughter or my daughter wouldn't be able to see one like I have. It's just an animal that's a beautiful, magnificent cat and they're having a little bit of trouble surviving. But they're doing it, and I would hate to see us do anything that would cause the survival of that cat to go backwards. ""I'm a livestock rancher, but I wouldn't mind donating a few calves to that jaguar, so to speak."" Biologist Emil McCain agrees. ""They are part of our natural heritage. They are part of the American West. They are part of the American wild as much as the bald eagle or the grizzly bear, and the jaguar is really special because it is such an elusive and beautiful creature [that] it evokes a sense of imagination and curiosity about the natural world."" Though the jaguar is elusive, conservationists say the animal is caught -- in the political crossfire at the border.  E-mail to a friend .",0.6088704,983
95,"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- As Zimbabwe battles a cholera epidemic that has already killed hundreds, one company thinks it may have found a potential solution to the world water crisis. A shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. Element Four, a small Canadian firm, has applied its water technology to create the WaterMill, a novel electricity-powered machine that draws moisture from the air and purifies it into clean drinkable water. The compact WaterMill, which goes on sale in the spring, is designed for household use. More crucially for countries such as Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Element Four is also working on another device, the WaterWall, which could potentially supply an entire village in the developing world. The team at Element Four shares an ambitious goal: to quench the world's growing thirst for water. Now the 10-person company is taking on a challenge that global multinationals have struggled to meet. Rick Howard, the CEO of the company, says it was at a U.N. conference on water in New York last summer that he realized just how revolutionary Element Four's technology might be. ""There we were on the same stage as GE, Dow Chemical and Siemens, and it was a complete shock to us when we heard the solutions they were offering. We realized we had something that could effect change,"" Howard tells CNN. The WaterMill draws in air through a filter and then cools it into water droplets. This water then passes through a special filter and is exposed to ultraviolet light, which rids it of bacteria. The product Element Four is designing for the developing world is called the WaterWall and is constructed by taking several of the water-making cells of the consumer appliance and hooking them up in series on a wall. The U.N., which has declared 2005-2015 the International Decade for Water, expects 1.8 billion people to live in regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. It's no wonder then that Element Four is being closely watched by the tech world. The WaterMill is being displayed at the Wired Store in New York, a temporary store the magazine opens every holiday season that showcases the future of technology. About one in five people in the world lack access to safe drinking water, and shortages pose serious health problems for much of the developing world. Lack of clean water, coupled with poor sanitation practices, can lead to outbreaks of water-borne diseases, such as cholera and dysentery, which in turn, can cause life-threatening forms of diarrhea. More than 500 people have died in Zimbabwe. Diarrheal disease is the third leading cause of death from infectious diseases, and the majority of those deaths are among children under the age of 5, according to the WHO and UNICEF. Most of those deaths could be prevented if improvements to sanitation and drinking water were made. But can an invention like the WaterWall really help ease the world's water shortage and help prevent health disasters like the outbreak in Zimbabwe from occurring in the future? ""There are some brilliant inventions out there, but they are expensive and difficult to get hold of,"" says Paul Jawor, an emergency water and sanitation consultant with international aid organization Doctors Without Borders. The WaterMill retails for about $1,300, but Howard estimates that a pared down version -- without the bells and whistle -- for use in places like Africa would cost about $300. The biggest challenge of a product like the WaterWall, Howard says, is the power consumed by the water-making cells. To counter that, the product is designed to turn on in stages so it doesn't overload fragile power grids. In comparison to solutions like desalination, which can cost billions of dollars to develop, that's cheap. ""For about $300 we can start saving lives. Ours is a very scalable product,"" Howard says. But there are skeptics. Frank Lawson, an engineering adviser at international charity WaterAid, said the solution Element Four is devising wouldn't be appropriate for the charity's projects. For one, the technology doesn't work in very dry climates. The machine only functions at or above about 35 percent relative humidity levels. Furthermore, it requires an energy source. ""Our technologies have to be within the capacity of the benefiting community -- both technically and financially,"" Lawson says. WaterAid uses a number of low-cost and sustainable solutions, such as rainwater harvesting and hand-dug wells, to help communities in more than 17 countries access water. But those solutions depend upon the availability of water in the area, and fresh water supplies worldwide are feeling the squeeze from population growth, pollution and climate change. Howard admits the company needs to focus on growing its business first, so it may be some time before the Element Four's products make their way to the developing world. ""We quickly came to realize that if we didn't first build a business to perfect the product and application, then we weren't going to be able to get to a point where we could have a significant humanitarian impact,"" he says. But Howard and partner Jonathan Ritchey are in various stages of discussions with several humanitarian groups in the field. Howard declined to name the organizations. It's early, but the company's core principle is ""to do good as we do well,"" he says. ""That's part of truly what drives us -- knowing that at some point we will be able to do some significant good.""",0.6085852,4239
96,"HOHENWALD, Tennessee (CNN) -- A pair of African elephants tramps through lush vegetation, stopping to scoop dust with their trunks and toss it onto their backs for protection from the summer sun. Tarra, who was a year old when Buckley met her, was the inspiration for The Elephant Sanctuary. Meanwhile, two others submerge their massive forms to splash and dip in the waters of a muddy pond. It's a scene that could have been pulled from a nature documentary. But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee. It's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia. But for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived. Tarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store. Shirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show. And Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles. ""We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,"" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary. Founded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants. It's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity. But Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo. Visitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible. ""In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,"" Buckley said. ""People have their own emotions, that energy,"" Buckley said. ""If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy. For Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra. Studying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. ""I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,"" she said. ""When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them. ""And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants."" From years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born. ""We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,"" Blais said. At the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff. They share space with deer, wild turkey, raccoons, skunks and other native Tennessee animals. Life in a circus, and in most zoos, is abusive to elephants, highly intelligent and social animals who, in the wild, may roam dozens of miles in a single day, the pair said. Research has shown that elephants, like humans, can suffer post-traumatic stress disorder after living in harsh or abusive conditions.  Watch more on life at the Elephant Sanctuary. » . ""Typically, when elephants are in captivity, they're under a lot of stress,"" Blais said. ""Their entire life is abnormal; it's unnatural, and that can often lead to aggression. ""Some will resign themselves and just kind of end up in this blank space, and others will act out, just venting their frustrations, but it's because of what captivity offers or what captivity doesn't offer them."" The elephants generally arrive at the sanctuary in one of two ways: Either the government finds that an owner is abusing the animals and seizes them, or the owners approach the sanctuary on their own, wanting a better life for the animals. In their 14-year history, Blais and Buckley say, they've been able to raise enough funds to keep expanding the sanctuary and its facilities. But tough economic times are taking a toll this year, and for the first time, they are nervous they'll bring in less money than they spend. But the mission of providing a home for the elephants they love will continue, they say. ""We feel incredibly fortunate to be doing what we do,"" Buckley said. ""It's hard work, it's long days, it's long weeks, but you're not going to hear us complain about it, because we're fortunate, and we know that. ""This is the most amazing work to do in a person's lifetime.""",0.60809666,7753
97,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Van Jones defies environmentalist stereotypes. He's not the earthy-crunchy, Birkenstock-wearing type. Nor is he a contemporary and corporate version -- a hedge fund-fueled entrepreneur looking to make millions by building wind farms and solar-powered corporate headquarters. ""We want to bring green jobs to people who don't have hope,"" says Van Jones, the president's ""green jobs"" chief. The new special adviser for ""green jobs"" -- those jobs that help reduce energy consumption and lessen environmental impact -- at the White House Council on Environmental Quality is in some ways like President Obama himself: an African-American community activist and organizer who has rocketed to the highest levels of government. Jones says it was death, of all things, that set him on his current career path as a green-jobs guru. In describing his turn from social activist to environmentalist, Jones recounted his experiences with young people in Oakland, California. ""I got involved in this work because I got tired of going to funerals. I got tired of seeing young people without any hope,"" Jones told CNN. ""I wanted them to have a better future. I said, 'Why don't we get these young people trained in green jobs so they can be a part of all these companies that are getting started?' "" So Jones, a Yale Law School graduate and longtime community activist, started an organization called ""Green For All"" in Oakland. The mission was to figure out how to train underprivileged young people in green-jobs skills, such as installing solar panels and retrofitting houses to make them more energy efficient.  Watch more on Van Jones' career » . ""People talk about global warming. ... I want to cool the Earth down. I also want to calm the block down,"" said Jones. Jones' efforts earned him national recognition and grabbed the attention of Obama's advisers. Now, he is the president's pitchman for green jobs, helping to coordinate government agencies focused on delivering millions of green jobs to the ailing U.S. economy. ""I see myself as the green-jobs handyman. My job is to make sure that the president's desire that we have literally millions of green jobs in our country actually turns into reality,"" said Jones. Yet even in places like Michigan, where unemployment is a whopping 15 percent -- well above the national average of 9.5 percent -- Jones understands there's skepticism about his message. CNN followed Jones on a recent visit to Lansing, Michigan, where he told attendees at a green-jobs conference that saving the planet and saving jobs can go hand in hand. ""You say, 'Oh no, oh no -- you're gonna talk about the caulking gun. Oh no!' "" Jones joked with the crowd. Critics, though, have serious concerns about the ""green collar"" agenda. They argue that those green jobs -- retrofitting homes to make them more energy-efficient, for instance -- will be mostly low-level and low-paying. Jones dismisses that. ""You take somebody and maybe this summer they're putting up solar panels,"" Jones said. ""Well guess what, this is a growing part of our economy -- the next summer they can be a manager, the next summer, maybe they can be an owner, an investor, an inventor."" While Jones tries to spread his green message, he's also trying to practice what he preaches. That means taking public transportation, including a bus and train ride, to get to his office just across the street from the White House. He says those rides give him valuable opportunities to hear unvarnished views. Describing his work as a member of the executive branch, Jones said, ""Everybody that comes talk to us, they've already got an agenda, they've got their game face on. [On] public transportation, people are themselves."" As for who Jones is, he gave CNN a brief look at his new office at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. On the walls hang pictures of his heroes, each Jones described with a different strength. Basketball legend Michael Jordan: dedication and commitment. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali: fighting spirit. Finally, pointing to a picture above his desk, Jones' tone grew softer. ""This is Bobby Kennedy the day before he was killed. In Watts, talking to some of the poorest people in California. And look at him. I mean, he's just present,"" Jones said, his eyes focused on Kennedy's image. ""We want to bring green jobs to these kind of folks. We want to bring green jobs to people who don't have hope.""",0.60761267,7773

""Sam was a friend, a visionary, and a professional whose years of service and passionate dedication to his work have left an indelible mark on the lands and wildlife we cherish,"" Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said in a written statement. ""His forward-thinking approach to conservation - including his view that we must think beyond boundaries at the landscape-scale- will continue to shape our nation's stewardship for years to come."" Hamilton took over the leadership of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in September. He was previously the regional director of the 10-state Southeast region for the agency. He was charged with a $484 million budget and oversight over more than 350 threatened and endangered species and 128 national wildlife refuges, according to the agency's Web site. While regional director, he also supported the creation of a carbon sequestration program that helped restore about 80,000 acres of wildlife habitat. His colleague, Thomas Strickland, assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, praised Hamilton's more than 30 years of service to the agency.

99,"(CNN) -- The U.N.'s forest carbon scheme which has formed part of the negotiations at the climate talks in Copenhagen has been one of the few areas where countries are broadly in agreement. The U.N.'s REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) program is a collaboration between the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Environmental (UNEP) and Development (UNDP) programs. Yemi Katerere, head of the U.N.-REDD program explained to CNN how the REDD program proposals would work. ""In theory REDD is a system to provide incentives for countries not to cut their forests,"" Katerere said. ""The incentive system is essentially that your trees are worth more standing than they are cut. You get a reward for not cutting your forests."" The idea is straightforward; If the function of rainforests -- capturing carbon, water catchment, weather regulators and biodiversity -- is recognized their value will rise. The destruction of the world's rainforests is estimated to contribute to as much as 20 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. REDD envisages a situation whereby ""different services can be marketed and paid for, boosting the incomes of other wise marginalized communities"". Many pilot schemes are already underway. Back in 1997 when the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, the part rainforests play in carbon storage wasn't recognized. Proposals to reduce emissions from deforestation were first introduced by the governments of Papua New Guinea in December 2005 at the COP11 talks in Canada. Talks at Copenhagen are hoping to build on the progress made since. REDD say that more than 30 models of how the program should work have been put forward by countries, groups of countries and NGOs. Katerere wouldn't be drawn on the outcome of negotiations at Copenhagen when CNN spoke to him on Thursday. Critics of the REDD program argue that it allows richer countries to meet -- to buy essentially -- some of their emissions obligations without cutting them at all. Others argue trying to measure what is being preserved and how much carbon is being stored will prove incredibly hard to quantify. But Katerere said an imperfect program which can be improved is better than none at all. ""We should stop focusing on the negatives issues of REDD and start looking at the positives. In the short term, REDD offers use the greatest mitigation potential at an affordable price and is the most cost effective.""",0.60641897,8644
100,"(CNN) -- A pea-sized seahorse, the world's longest insect, a ""ghost slug"" and the world's smallest snake were among the top 10 species discovered in 2008, a committee of scientists said Friday. A tiny seahorse and the world's longest insect were among the top 10 new species discovered in 2008. These unusual critters were among thousands of species found last year, many in remote or tropical regions of the planet, that hint at the breadth of the Earth's undiscovered biodiversity. ""Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth's species is,"" said Quentin Wheeler, director of the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University, which announced the top 10 new species list. ""We are surrounded by such an exuberance of species diversity that we too often take it for granted,"" Wheeler added. The ASU institute and an international committee of taxonomists -- scientists devoted to species exploration and classification -- compile the top 10 list of new species each year. Also on the 2008 list are a caffeine-free coffee plant, a snail whose shell twists around four axes, a palm that flowers itself to death and microscopic bacteria that live in hairspray.   See photos of the new species » . Here's the complete list: . 1. Pygmy seahorse: Classified by its Latin name, Hippocampus satomiae, this species measures about half an inch long and was found near Derawan Island off Kalimantan, Indonesia. 2. A plant that kills itself: Found in a small area of northwestern Madagascar, a rare genus of palm -- Tahina spectablilis -- produces huge, spectacular flowers and then dies and collapses. Fewer than 100 have been found. 3. Decaf, please: Known as Coffea charrieriana, this plant found in Cameroon is the first record of a caffeine-free coffee species from Central Africa. 4. Spray-on species: An extremophile bacteria, Microbacterium hatanonis, was discovered in hairspray by Japanese scientists. 5. A stick that moves: The world's longest insect, with a body length of 14 inches (22.3 inches including legs), Phobaeticus chani resembles a stick and was found in Borneo, Malaysia. 6. The Barbados Threadsnake: Leptotyphlops carlae measures only 4.1 inches long and is believed to be the world's smallest snake. 7. A pale ""ghost slug"": Selenochlamys ysbryda was a surprising find in the densely populated area of Cardiff, Wales. 8. A very limber snail: This unique species, Opisthostoma vermiculum, is found on a limestone hill in Malaysia and has a shell that twists around four axes. 9. Damsel in the deep blue sea: Chromis abyssus is a beautiful species of damselfish found in deep-reef habitat off the coast of Ngemelis Island, Palau. 10. Fossil mama: A fossilized fish, Materpiscis attenboroughi, is an extremely rare find from Western Australia and shows a mother giving birth 380 million years ago. Scientists are still classifying species found around the globe in 2008, so final data for that year are not available. But on Friday, the taxonomists issued a State of Observed Species report card that states 18,516 species new to science -- about half of them insects -- were discovered and described in 2007. The vast majority of the 18,516 species named in 2007 were invertebrate animals (75.6 percent), vascular plants (11.1 percent) and vertebrates (6.7 percent). The report was compiled by ASU's International Institute for Species Exploration in partnership with other scientists. ""Charting the species of the world and their unique attributes are essential parts of understanding the history of life,"" Wheeler said. ""It is in our own self-interest as we face the challenges of living on a rapidly changing planet."" According to Wheeler, a new generation of tools is coming online that will vastly accelerate the rate at which humans can discover and describe species. The annual release of the top 10 new species list and State of Observed Species report commemorate the anniversary of the birth of Carolus Linnaeus, who initiated the modern system of plant and animal names and classifications. An estimated 1.8 million species have been described since Linnaeus initiated the modern systems for naming plants and animals in the 18th century. Scientists estimate that there are between 2 million and 100 million species on Earth, though most set the number closer to 10 million, according to ASU. ""It is estimated that the approximately 1.8 million species named since 1758 represent no more than a fraction of the world's species,"" the report states. ""Rapid environmental changes around the world highlight the urgent need to accelerate our exploration of Earth's species,"" the report says. ""Millions of species -- the majority not yet known to science -- face an uncertain future. Among these species are keys to understanding the history of the origin and diversification of life on our planet.""",0.6058812,3932
101,"(CNN) -- An estimated 125,000 Western lowland gorillas are living in a swamp in equatorial Africa, researchers reported Tuesday, double the number of the endangered primates thought to survive worldwide. Forest clearings draw large numbers of Western lowland gorillas searching for food. ""It's pretty astonishing,"" Hugo Rainey, one of the researchers who conducted the survey for the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told CNN Tuesday. The last census on the species, carried out during the 1980s, estimated that there were only 100,000 of the gorillas left worldwide. Since then, the researchers estimated, the numbers had been cut in half. WCS survey teams conducted the research in 2006 and 2007, traveling to the remote Lac Tele Community Reserve in northern Republic of Congo, a vast area of swamp forest. Acting on a tip from hunters who indicated the presence of gorillas, Rainey said that the researchers trekked on foot through mud for three days to the outskirts of Lac Tele, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the nearest road. ""When we went there, we found an astonishing amount of gorillas,"" said Rainey, speaking from the International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. Though researchers did spot some gorillas, they based their estimate on the number of gorilla nests found at the site, Rainey said. Each gorilla makes a nest to sleep in at night. ""This is the highest-known density of gorillas that's ever been found,"" Rainey said.  Watch a glimpse of gorilla life in African swamp » .

102,"YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Montana (CNN)  -- The gray wolf was officially removed from the Endangered Species Act's ""threatened"" list Friday after three decades -- a decision that has stoked controversy among environmentalists and ranchers. Federal officials estimate there are 1,500 gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park. It means the wolves can be shot and killed once they step out of Yellowstone National Park as soon as the affected states establish a hunting season. However, state Fish and Wildlife officials can shoot the animals whenever they deem the wolves to be a problem. The government delisted the wolves -- which were eliminated from Yellowstone decades ago before being reintroduced in the 1990s -- because they are now thriving in the park that is dominated by bison, elk and bighorn sheep. ""They're back here in the Northern Rockies; they're back here in Yellowstone,"" said Doug Smith, a biologist for the National Park Service in Yellowstone. ""That's something to celebrate given their history of human hatred."" But not everyone is happy about the animal being removed from the endangered list. Conservationists believe hundreds of gray wolves straying from Yellowstone in search of prey could soon be killed by hunters and ranchers.  Watch rancher say no wolf is ""sacred"" » . ""We're not ready to pop the champagne corks and have a party,"" said Doug Honnold, the managing attorney for Earthjustice, a non-profit environmental law firm based in Oakland, California, that has threatened to sue the government. ""My biggest fear is we're going to go backwards instead of forwards."" It wouldn't be the first time. In the early 20th century, wolves were the targets of a massive government extermination campaign. ""It's harder to find an animal more persecuted than wolves. ... We did wolf extermination with a vengeance,"" said Smith. But attitudes began to change in the 1980s. Elk and bison populations increased dramatically because there was no natural predator to keep their numbers in check. In 1995, Smith led a team to bring wolves back to the Rocky Mountain landscape. They transplanted dozens of wolves to Yellowstone from Canada.  See photos of Yellowstone's animals » . The project has been regarded as an overwhelming success. There are now more than 1,500 wolves across Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, according to the government. That number convinced federal wildlife officials to remove them from the endangered species list. Federal officials require each of the three states to maintain a population of 100 wolves, meaning a total of 300 wolves across all three states. The states have actually pledged to keep the population higher than that, at a rate of 150 wolves per state. ""We did a thorough analysis,"" said Ed Bangs, the wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ""The consensus [for recovery] is a population of 300 wolves and 30 breeding pairs."" He added, ""The wolf population is fully recovered. We have more wolves than we ever predicted and we have fewer problems than we ever predicted."" Earthjustice says that's not nearly enough to ensure a viable population and they want to stop the delisting. ""We're going to have hundreds of wolves die needlessly,"" said Honnold. But many ranchers in the region just don't understand the fuss about the animals. They have complained for years that the wolves eat their livestock. ""There's nothing about a wolf that's sacred,"" said Bruce Malcolm, a cattle rancher and Republican member of Montana's House of Representatives. He said he's lost nearly two dozen cows to the wolves in recent years. ""I would have preferred that they never came here,"" he said. If there's a winner with the controversy, it's Yellowstone. The wolves have pushed up attendance by more than a 100,000 visitors per year, according to a park study. Smith, who has dedicated his life to the wolves, is philosophical about the debate.

The theme in 2009 is described simply as ""Earth."" The aim is to highlight how man exploits the planet's resources and how this impacts the landscapes and communities surrounding them. In an extraordinary series of photos Canadian Christopher Anderson captures how the quest for raw materials affects Venezuela. In ""The Diminishing Present,"" Portuguese-born Edgar Martins records forest landscapes in the moments before they are engulfed by flames. In ""Curse of the Black Gold: 50 Years of Oil in the Niger Delta,"" Ed Kashi captures the impact of the oil industry on Nigeria's environment and people since it was first discovered five decades ago. Kashi, an American photojournalist, spent three years compiling his photos of the Niger Delta, making a total of five trips to the troubled region. Kashi told CNN: ""It was truly one of the most graphic examples of economic inequity that I have ever seen. Especially with the backdrop of hundreds of billions of oil wealth that has been generated over the previous 50 years."" As a result of his work, Kashi says that his photos are now being used by universities and NGOs to raise awareness to try and effect change. To him, this has been one of the most gratifying and exciting by-products of his work. One of this year's most intriguing entries is by Sammy Baloji, who superimposes colonial black and white archive photos of Belgian-run mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and places them over his color images of the decaying mines as seen today. Nadav Kander's images of China's Yangtze River depict communities adjusting to the changes caused by the re-routing of the country's largest river. And, Andreas Gursky has captured an extraordinary image of an ocean of rubbish at a landfill site in Mexico City. Darren Almond's ethereal images of China's Yellow Mountain Range are made all the more magical through the knowledge that they were shot using only the light of the Moon.

105,"(CNN) -- A large ice shelf is ""imminently"" close to breaking away from part of the Antarctic Peninsula, scientists said Friday. Scientists are investigating whether the ice breakup is caused by global climate change. Satellite images released by the European Space Agency on Friday show new cracks in the Wilkins Ice Shelf where it connects to Charcot Island, a piece of land considered part of the peninsula. The cracks are quickly expanding, the ESA said. Scientists are investigating the causes for the breakups and whether it is linked to global climate change. The Wilkins Ice Shelf -- a large mass of floating ice -- would still be connected to Latady Island, which is also part of the peninsula, and Alexander Island, which is not, said professor David Vaughan, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey. The ice shelf experienced a great amount of changes last year, the ESA said. In February 2008, the shelf dropped 164 square miles (425 square kilometers) of ice. In May it lost a 62-square-mile chunk. That meant the ""bridge"" of ice connecting Wilkins to the islands was just 984 yards wide at its narrowest location, the ESA said. Further rifts developed in October and November, said Angelika Humbert of the Institute of Geophysics at Germany's Muenster University. ""During the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 square kilometers (694 square miles), or about 14 percent of its size,"" Humbert said. Antarctica's ice sheet was formed over thousands of years by accumulated and compacted snow. Along the coast, the ice gradually floats on the sea, forming massive ledges known as ice shelves, the ESA says. Several of these ice shelves, including seven in the past 20 years, have retreated and disintegrated. The Wilkins Ice Shelf had been stable for most of the past century before it began retreating in the 1990s. ""It had been there almost unchanged since the first expeditions which mapped it back in the 1930s, so it had a very long period of real stability, and it's only in the last decade that it's started to retreat,"" Vaughan said. Wilkins is the size of the state of Connecticut, or about half the area of Scotland. It is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened. If the ice shelf breaks away from the peninsula, it will not cause a rise in sea level because it is already floating, scientists say. Some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse. The Antarctic Peninsula is the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America.",0.5955287,2325
106,"(CNN) -- For the first time in decades, the hunting of the gray wolf is legal again in the United States. And that's a good thing for ranchers like Cindy Siddoway of Terreton, Idaho, whose sheep are threatened every day by wolves. Gray wolves were taken off the endangered species list after their population rebounded. ""We have worked very hard to protect what we have, and it's not very successful,"" she said. ""It is devastating for us to put all of the money and the time and the genetics and work to produce a great product and then just have it half-eaten and left to die."" But wolf hunting isn't popular with everybody. It has become a controversy in Idaho, where the hunt began Tuesday, and in Montana, where it is scheduled to start September 15. Environmental and animal rights groups are upset by a federal decision this year to remove gray wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains from the endangered species list, a move that opened the door to permitting the hunts. They are seeking an injunction in U.S. District Court in Montana to stop the hunts. Judge Donald Molloy is reviewing the case, and it's unclear when he will rule. After their population dwindled in the Rockies last century, in part because of practices like trapping, gray wolves were put on the endangered species list. But the population has rebounded, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service delisted the animals and determined that the populations would be healthy enough for hunts to be permitted in Idaho and Montana, which manage the wolf populations. There are also gray wolves in Wyoming, but hunts are not permitted there because of the state's weak wildlife management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. Opponents of the hunt say the population is not large and healthy enough to allow hunting. Melanie Stein, a Sierra Club spokeswoman, said that the wolf populations ""are just on the cusp of recovery and that we are almost there."" But she says the hunts represent ""a step backward and away from recovery"" of the wolf populations. Defenders of Wildlife, one of several groups urging the court to stop the hunt, detailed the ecological role of the wolves on its Web site. ""In what is known as the cascade effect, wolves are exerting influence over a multitude of species within the park's ecosystem. Elk, wary of the reintroduced top predator, have altered their grazing behavior. ""With less grazing pressure from elk, streambed vegetation such as willow and aspen is regenerating after decades of overbrowsing. As the trees are restored, they create better habitat for native birds and fish, beaver and other species."" Siddoway doesn't think the hunt will make much of a difference right now because it is hard to kill the animals. But the wolf attacks take their toll. For example, the wolves will kill Great Pyrenees guard dogs used to protect the herds. When that happens, ""then we're open to prey from bears and everything else,"" Siddoway said. ""We know that it's a problem, and we want to make sure ranchers can continue on with their livelihood,"" Stein said. ""But there has to be some co-existence between wolves and other species."" Currently, ranchers and farmers can legally shoot a wolf they see attacking their livestock, said Ed Bangs, wolf recovery coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There are also tools used to counter wolf attacks without hunting, he said. They include scare tactics, like shooting firecrackers out of a shotgun, or proper fencing. ""All that stuff works for a little while in some instances for a short period of time and in some situations can be helpful. But it isn't the silver bullet for wolf depredation,"" he said. He said these techniques work ""in conjunction with killing wolves."" There are state and private programs compensating ranchers who lose livestock because of attacks, but the money represents only part of what the livestock and the time dealing with the problem is worth. ""The ranchers got the short end of the stick,"" Bangs said. Officials say that up to 330 wolves in the states of Idaho and Montana may be killed during this public hunt. In Idaho, the limit is 220 wolves, and in Montana, it would be 75. Members of the Nez Perce tribe in Idaho can kill up to 35 wolves. Ed Mitchell, spokesman for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, said three wolves have been taken in Idaho since the hunting season began. There are more than 1,600 gray wolves in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. But Siddoway says ""there will never be enough"" for environmental groups to agree to the hunts.

107,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A trendy California sushi restaurant says it's closing after being accused of serving illegal whale meat. The company that owns Santa Monica's The Hump restaurant had already apologized for the whale meat accusation earlier in the week. The restaurant's Web site said: ""After 12 years doing business in Santa Monica, The Hump will be closing its doors effective March 20, 2010. The Hump hopes that by closing its doors, it will help bring awareness to the detrimental effect that illegal whaling has on the preservation of our ocean ecosystems and species."" The investigation into the eatery began in October when two members of the team that made the documentary, ""The Cove"" visited The Hump, officials said. ""The Cove,"" which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary earlier in March. Armed with a hidden camera, two women from the documentary captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said. A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as ""whale"" and ""horse"" with a cost of $85 written next to them. The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University. He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said. The meat from whales, considered an endangered species, cannot be sold legally in the United States. The restaurant, located at the Santa Monica Airport, is known for its exotic fare. Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for ""a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced."" Prosecutors have also charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc., the parent company of the restaurant, and one of its chefs -- Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, 45 -- with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose. The misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $200,000 for the company, federal authorities said. The Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act make it illegal, except under very limited circumstances, to hunt, kill or capture whales and also prohibit trade in the animals or any part of them.

108,"(CNN) -- The United Nations is urging countries to invest in green jobs working with ""sustainable forest management"" to address the growing problem of unemployment worldwide. A deforested area appears in a rain forest in Brazil's Para state  in October. At least 10 million such jobs could be created, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization will say in a report to be released this week. The report does not mention any countries but is aimed at ""mainly regions with substantial rural unemployment and degraded land areas,"" said C.T.S. Nair, chief economist in the U.N. Forestry Department and one of the authors of the report. While all countries could benefit from investing in these green jobs, Nair said, Asia and Africa -- and to some extent Latin America -- could benefit the most. India, China and almost all countries in Africa stand to benefit, he added. The United Nations said it already is seeing indications that some countries -- such as the United States, India and South Korea -- are interested and taking action to invest in sustainable forest management by making it part of their economic stimulus plans. Sustainable forestry aims to prevent depletion of forests by managing them and making sure their use does not interfere with natural benefits or the local environment. For example, in forests where wood is being removed, the United Nations is suggesting that people be hired to monitor and manage how much wood is taken out to ensure the forest does not become depleted and can grow back fully. Managers also would make sure the wood harvest wouldn't affect biodiversity and the water supply. The report will be discussed and analyzed next week at the U.N. Committee on Forestry meeting in Rome, Italy. The Food and Agriculture Organization has designated next week as World Forest Week.",0.5923628,2160
109,"GARUT, Indonesia (CNN) -- The people of Indonesia's Java Island still follow wedding traditions passed down centuries ago by their ancestors. Cucu and his bride, Yati Supriyatna, plant two saplings during their wedding ceremony. Family members gather for an all-day ceremony that begins with the groom bringing a gift to the bride's house. On a hot and sticky morning in a village near Garut, 26-year-old Cucu carries a sapling to give to his bride. The young tree is not exactly a unique gift; it's part of a government initiative to bring back the Garut province's devastated forests. Newly married couples must plant 10 trees under the program. If they divorce, they must plant 50 others. Cucu and his bride, Yati Supriyatna -- both dressed in all white -- headed to a mosque in the foothills of West Java's mountains, where they carefully planted two saplings, a symbolic gesture. The young couple met in school three years ago and began dating last year.  Watch as Indonesia tackles deforestation » . ""We're just meant to be,"" said 18-year-old Yati, giggling in her white flower-adorned veil. They will plant the other saplings -- eucalyptus, avocado and mahogany -- at the sleepy village about an hour outside Garut where they plan to settle, for now. Indonesia's landscape has been devastated by massive deforestation. Though not a heavily industrialized nation, Indonesia is behind China and the United States as the world's third largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions. That is largely the result of the removal of its trees, which cut down the absorption of carbon dioxide. While Garut province is not the country's worst offender, a Garut forestry official said he can no longer ignore the damage. ""Most people here work in agriculture which is of course highly dependent on the fertility of the soil,"" said Eddy Muharam of Garut's forestry department. ""The fertility is decreasing now because of deforestation and intensive use of soil."" Forestry officials have identified ""critical land"" in Garut, which has been overfarmed and needs to be reforested. The overfarming leads to erosion, which can cause major flooding. Environmental officials estimate that 50 million trees are needed in Garut alone to reverse the harm done by overfarming. Indonesia's government does not have the funds to pay for such an initiative. So they hope the trend of planting saplings will catch on among other newlyweds in Indonesia. ""It's sacred and a once in a lifetime moment, so we thought that it would be a good time to encourage people's participation,"" Muharam said.

110,"LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (CNN)  -- A vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment Tuesday. The inside of one of the vaults at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean. Dubbed the ""Doomsday Vault,"" the seed bank on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world's seed collections, protecting them from a wide range of threats including war, natural disasters, lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management. Norwegian musicians performed Tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault, located 130 meters (427 feet) inside a frozen mountain. Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize, placed the first seeds inside the vault, followed by other dignitaries. The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds, with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world. In all, the shipment of seeds secured in the vault Tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons, filling 676 boxes. The shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total, ranging from major African and Asian food staples like maize, rice, and wheat to European and South American varieties of eggplant, lettuce, barley, and potato, according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds.  Watch as ""Doomsday"" seed vault opens »  Eventually the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, as it is officially known, will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world, the Global Crop Diversity Trust said. The Norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near Longyearbyen, in the remote Svalbard islands between Norway and the North Pole. Building began last year. The United Nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity, and countries and foundations provide the funding. ""The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries,"" said Cary Fowler, executive director of the trust. ""At these temperatures, seeds for important crops like wheat, barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years."" The vault's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside. ""We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility,"" said Magnus Bredeli Tveiten, project manager for the Norwegian government. The vault sits at the end of a 120-meter (131-yard) tunnel blasted inside the mountain. Workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees Celsius (just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit), and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area's natural permafrost and the mountain's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 C (25 F). The vault at Svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in Sussex, England, about an hour outside London. The British vault, called the Millennium Seed Bank, is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants, as opposed to the seeds of crops. Paul Smith, the leader of the Millennium Seed Bank project, said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops. ""We must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us,"" Smith told CNN. The idea for the Arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources came into force in 2004, the Norwegian government said. The treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity. Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world. The Norwegian government says it has paid 50 million Norwegian Kroner ($9.4 million) to build the seed vault. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Becky Anderson contributed to this report.",0.59024465,464
111,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday. The exact cause of Nico's sudden death on Saturday is inconclusive from the initial necropsy or animal autopsy. The Georgia Aquarium hopes to find out more information in the months ahead from a more detailed necropsy. ""As we work with and care for the many animals at the Georgia Aquarium, we become attached emotionally,"" said Dr. Gregory D. Bossart, chief veterinary officer at the aquarium. ""The loss is not unlike that of faithful dog or special horse that has been a part your life for years."" Nico died at Sea World in San Antonio, where he and two other beluga whales had been moved temporarily while the Georgia Aquarium is undergoing renovation. Nico was scheduled to return home to Atlanta next month with companions Maris and Natasha. Nico arrived in Atlanta with Gaspar, two whales obtained from a park in Mexico. Both animals suffered ""significant health issues"" from their times in a foreign park and were essentially ""living on borrowed time,"" said Bossart, who had been caring for the two whales as far as nine years ago, while they were still in Mexico. ""We rescued Nico knowing that he had health issues due to his prior home, but we were confident that we could provide a better quality of life for his final years,"" Bossart said. Gaspar was suffering from a bone disease contracted before arriving at the downtown Atlanta aquarium and was euthanized in January 2007. Another beluga whale, Marina, died 11 months later from complications of old age. Beluga whales or white whales, whose name is derived from a Russian word meaning white, typically live in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions including Canada, Russia, Greenland and the U.S. state of Alaska. They can live up to 35 years. The belugas are not the only high-profile deaths at the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in late 2005. A pair of whale sharks have also died at the eight-million-gallon facility, the only one outside Asia to display the giant fish. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",0.58828026,7181

113,"London, England (CNN) -- If the location is anything to go by, then the omens are promising. Denmark's capital city, Copenhagen -- host to the U.N. climate summit which starts today -- is already one of the greenest cities in Europe. With over 300 kilometers of cycle lanes it is estimated that around 40 percent of the 1.2 population travel to work on a bicycle. And visitors to the city are encouraged to join in by making use of the network of city bikes for a deposit of just 20 DKK ($4). The influence of two wheels has extended into Yuletide this year, as cyclists in City Hall Square are generating the electricity powering the lights on the Christmas tree. It's just one of hundreds of activities and events which Copenhageners have organized to coincide with the 11-day U.N. summit taking place at the Bella Center in the Orestad district in the southeast of the city. The opening of the summit marks the end of an exhaustive planning period by the city. Preparations at the Bella Center began two years ago. The finishing touches began eight weeks ago. ""It is, by far, the largest conference we have ever held and the largest political conference in Europe,"" the Bella Center press manager, Lars Lemche told CNN. ""If numbers continue to grow, it will be the biggest political meeting the U.N. has ever held,"" he said. The center has hosted big events before -- a European Union summit in 2002 and the 2006 MTV European Music Awards -- but the U.N. summit makes them look like a tea party. ""A conference is 36 hours. This is 11 days,"" Lemche said. The Bella Center has had to extend its floor space to 77,000 square meters -- the size of 11 football pitches -- to accommodate all delegates and 1000 staff will be on hand throughout. Numbers are expected to peak at around 18,000 in the second week when 100 heads of state arrive for the high-level political negotiations. This Herculean effort of planning is being backed up by a raft of green initiatives. Outside the conference center solar-powered streetlights are helping light the car parks. A wind turbine is helping power the lights indoors. Inside the conference center delegates will eat from a menu that is 65 percent organic and drink water that has come out of a tap rather than a bottle. Pens provided will be made from recycled plastic, and even the carpets are biodegradable. In a bid to offset the considerable carbon dioxide emissions - estimated to be 40,000 tons -- generated by the summit, organizers are funding the replacement of polluting brick factories in Dhaka, Bangladesh with 20 new efficient ones. Despite the disruption, Copenhageners have gone about their daily business as usual. Jason Heppenstall, Editor of The Copenhagen Post, a weekly English language newspaper told CNN: ""There hasn't been much of a build up until the last few days. Until about two weeks ago it's not been talked about a lot in the press and maybe a month ago half the people in Denmark didn't know there was going to be a conference,"" he told CNN. People are starting to notice changes now, and the mood among Copenhageners is positive, apart from the locals living near the Bella Center and whose lives have been disrupted by all the security arrangements, Heppenstall said. The concrete barriers and the perimeter fence erected to protect the Bella Center have been one of the more obvious signs of security in the city. And now that the conference has started, 6000 officers will be on duty during the conference. Niels-Otto Fisker, communications advisor to the Danish national police commissioner, told CNN: ""It is the single greatest operation that the Danish police have undertaken. Police are being drafted in from all over the country, and shifts are being extended from eight to 12-16 hours."" In all, the security operations are costing the Danish government an estimated $122 million. Last week, police unveiled a 22-ton vehicle armed with a water canon which will be used if trouble flares during the conference. The only confrontations in the buildup to the conference have been between Copenhagen's female mayor, Ritt Bjerregaard, and the city's prostitutes. A row started after city leaders requested hotels display postcards saying: ""Be sustainable: Don't buy sex."" The prostitutes -- whose are free to work under Danish law -- have responded by offering their services free of charge. ""Our office is based in the red-light district. There are prostitutes here, but it's not like Amsterdam,"" Heppenstall explained. ""I think some people coming to the conference think it might be. So the city council have been trying to pre-empt it by sending postcards saying please refrain from going to these areas. The sex workers have responded by saying that's ridiculous. They see this as their big moment."" As Copenhagen hands over to the U.N. for two weeks, the world's eyes are now turning to negotiations which precede the arrival of U.S. President Barack Obama and company. Earlier this year, Copenhagen announced the aim of being carbon neutral by 2025. Perhaps the U.N. could take a leaf out of their host's book.",0.58712274,7106
114,"ROCKWOOD, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Four generations of Saylors have worked the family's dairy farm for nearly a century, but for the past three years, the cows have been doing something besides providing milk: They've been helping power the place. ""The farm used to get a lot of complaints,"" says farmer Shawn Saylor. ""It used to stink a lot."" Growing up on the sprawling spread 90 minutes from Pittsburgh, 36-year-old farmer Shawn Saylor developed into a self-described science buff. So it was no surprise that, when faced with rising energy costs, Saylor turned to technology. He tapped into an abundant and easily accessible energy source: manure from about 600 cows.  Watch how cow poo powers the farm » . ""It's a pretty simple process. There's not really a lot to it,"" Saylor said. ""Manure comes from the cows, and there's energy left in the manure."" The process is known as anaerobic digestion, and here's how it works: . With the help of a mechanical scraper in the barn, manure drops into a 19,000-gallon tank. The slurry then moves into the digester, which is 16 feet deep and 70 feet in diameter. It's heated there for about 16 days while the bacteria break down the organic matter in order to produce methane gas. That gas is burned in two engine generators to make electricity.  See an interactive explaining the process » . Heat created by the generators keeps the digester hot, heats the buildings around the farm and helps provide hot water. The electricity is used to power this farm and a dozen neighboring homes, Saylor said. And there's still some left over, which he sells back to the grid. Overall, the poo power helps Saylor's bottom line. ""In savings, there's $200,000 a year, in either extra income from sale of electricity or cost offsets,"" he said. ""So you're talking about system project costs of over a million dollars to build the system but a payback of five years or less."" Before he installed the system, the pungent smell from the cows could linger for three to four days, Saylor said. ""The farm used to get a lot of complaints from motorists, which is understandable. It used to stink a lot."" Now, the digesters reduce 98 percent of all odor, although he admits that if the wind blows, you still ""get a whiff."" The farm's leftover solid waste is sold to the community. ""We use it for bedding for the animals,"" according to Saylor. ""A lot of people like to get it for their gardens ... because it doesn't smell much."" Farm-based digesters became popular in the United States during the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. But the technology didn't catch on, possibly because of the high operational costs and declining energy prices, according to the Department of Agriculture. Although Saylor had been interested in digesters for years, his dream didn't become reality until 2006. That's when he received a $600,000 grant from Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection. But Saylor's work isn't done. He intends to make his farm entirely self-sufficient by using waste vegetable oil to make biodiesel fuel. He said his goal is to waste nothing. ""In a biodiesel system, all the waste products can either be used or fed back into the digester to make more gas,"" he said. ""I've always looked at new technologies and believed you kind of have to work with that stuff to stay with the future.""",0.5869797,5996
115,"(CNN) -- Mourners packed into a church in Illinois Monday to remember a woman whose death made headlines worldwide. At the St. Rita of Cascia Shrine Chapel in Chicago, a funeral was held for Dawn Brancheau, a SeaWorld trainer who died last week after a killer whale dragged her underwater at Shamu Stadium in Orlando, Florida. A memorial service for the 40-year-old will take place in Orlando, Florida, at a future date, according to the Blake Lamb Funeral Home. Brancheau had wanted to be an animal trainer from the time she visited SeaWorld as a 9-year-old, her sister Diane Gross said last week. ""It was her dream job,"" Gross said. ""She loved the animals like they were her own children. ... She loved what she did."" Brancheau was pulled underwater Wednesday at SeaWorld Orlando, when a 6-ton killer whale named Tilikum grabbed her ponytail. A source at SeaWorld said the whale dove deep underwater after seizing Brancheau. Trainers had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later. The same whale was linked previously to two other human deaths. Tilikum and two other whales were involved in the 1991 drowning of a trainer at a marine park in Victoria, British Columbia. The trainer fell into the whale tank at Sealand of the Pacific and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of the whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. Labor Department spokesman Mike Wald said the safety and health agency is looking into whether Occupational Safety and Health Administration workplace standards were violated in Brancheau's death. The agency will complete a report within six months, he said. If workplace infractions are found, OSHA will propose financial penalties, Wald said. If that happens, the company could accept the penalties and make needed workplace changes or appeal the penalties before an OSHA review commission. Inspectors also are looking into the incident from an animal-welfare perspective, said David Sacks, an Agriculture Department spokesman. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service wants to know whether federal standards were violated in the exhibiting of warm-blooded mammals.

""I expect to continue development of the Pampa project, but not at the pace that I originally expected."" The Pickens Plan was an attempt to wean the United States off foreign oil and switch to wind and natural gas. The project was to be set in four Texas Panhandle counties. Pickens said he faced hurdles in routing the power from Texas to a distribution system. His plans were also stymied by a plunge in natural gas prices and a tightening credit market.

122,"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Like that other famous environmentalist, Thomas Friedman began his talk at the Asia Society in Hong Kong on December 16 with a simple PowerPoint slide. But that's where the similarities between Al Gore and The New York Times columnist end. Thomas L. Friedman has taken on a green hue with his latest book, ""Hot, Flat and Crowded"". Unlike Gore, Friedman is a distinctly different shade of green, a deeply pragmatic green that believes economic forces can usher in a revolution in environmental policy. He argues that systemic change simply requires showing the world that it needs green technology and letting pure economics do the rest. As a journalist, Friedman makes no claims to having scientific expertise in climate change. He is approaching it from a philosophical standpoint. Green capital . Friedman's new book ""Hot, Flat and Crowded"" is not a major departure from his previous books. Whether he's discussing globalization or green industry, he is writing from his deep-seated belief in the markets. He is an unabashed capitalist. For Friedman, the system works but it's not immune to bad decision-making. Green industry like globalization will come of age if given the right market environment. His faith in capitalism is equal to that in green technology -- for him, these are two things that are clearly reconcilable. So how do we do this? America as the bastion for innovation, Friedman argues, should play a big role. In fact, he confesses it really isn't a book about the environment and energy, its a book about America. For Friedman, America is slipping down the ranks of hegemonic power and climate change is its big chance to reposition itself as a global leader. The environment is merely an allegory for how the U.S. will achieve this revival. As an extension of that argument, all countries need to do the same. Right now, no country has really taken the lead in environmental technology, so what we have at the moment is an all out race to the top. Indeed Friedman's book was written before the financial meltdown but recent events have furthered his argument that environmental technology is the solution of all solutions. It's a sentiment I also came across at the recent Clinton Global Initiative meeting. Green Dream Team . Friedman seemed cautiously optimistic about Obama's ability to lead the green revolution. Given the disarray of many of America's financial institutions, it's unclear whether this new green message will get through. A glimmer of hope however is Obama's newly appointed energy secretary Steven Chu. There's been extensive chatter about him on environmental blogs in recent days with the media calling Chu the head of Obama's ""Green Dream Team."" Friedman made a ringing endorsement of Chu as did many in the audience that day. Steven Chu, Nobel Laureate and the head of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, is seen as a promising choice for many environmentalists, one perhaps that proves Obama's intention to fulfill a key campaign promise on energy policy. Chu himself underwent an interesting move from physics to environmental technology. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 but left the world of Quantum Physics to study the science of global warming. As head of Berkeley National Lab, he led projects to the tune of $650 million channeling much of it towards green technology to develop advanced biofuels and solar power.  Watch a video of Steven Chu from Berkeley University . Changing light bulbs and leaders . The audience listening to Friedman that day was clearly appreciative of his no-nonsense approach to the green issue. As Friedman puts it, ""it's not about changing light bulbs, it's about changing leaders."" He confessed to having attended too many Earth Day concerts in the past and that no matter how many celebrities you get to show up or how you offset the event, it won't be enough to set off this green revolution. So as I sat there wondering whether the fish the guests had been eating for lunch was sustainable, for Friedman, it didn't really matter. For his revolution, he had bigger fish to fry.",0.5818399,4661
123,"(CNN) -- What on Earth would drive a man to swim in Arctic waters wearing nothing but Speedos, goggles and a cap? Lewis Pugh braves the icy water off the arctic archipelogo of Svalbard. For Lewis Pugh, it was a love of the environment and a passionate desire to save the Arctic from global warming. His 1 km swim (0.62 of a mile) in 2007 made him the first person to complete a long-distance swim at the North Pole -- the purpose, to highlight the fact that it was possible to swim for a kilometer in a place that should be solid ice. Pugh, now aged 39, is a former maritime lawyer who abandoned his practice six years ago to become a full-time environmentalist and adventurer. Since then he has become the first person to complete long-distance swims in all five of the world's oceans and has become the world's leading cold water swimmer. Born in England and brought up in South Africa, Pugh sees himself in the mould of pioneering British adventurers like Sir Edmund Hillary, fearlessly braving waters no one else would dare swim. But rather than just aiming for a place in the history books, his motivation is to publicize the environmental damage he has witnessed on his swims. In 2006, to raise awareness about global warming and that year's drought in England, Pugh swam the entire length of the River Thames -- all except the first 26 miles, which had already dried up. He took a break from the 200-mile journey to call in at No. 10 Downing Street, where he discussed climate change with Tony Blair. The next year, Pugh became the first person to swim the 87 mile-width of the Maldives. The 10-day swim was Pugh's way of raising awareness of how climate change is threatening to submerge low-lying islands. But he is best known for his North Pole adventure. His Arctic swim lasted 19 minutes in temperatures of around minus 2 degrees Celsius. Were any normal person to fall into waters that cold they would be in serious trouble. Pugh's long-time coach Professor Tim Noakes told CNN, ""People usually drown very quickly on exposure to cold water because they start to hyperventilate and when you hyperventilate you can't coordinate. They inhale water and they can't coordinate their swimming. Most people can't even go 20 meters if they are exposed to ice-cold water."" But Pugh has developed a unique mechanism for overcoming freezing conditions. He is apparently able to increase his body temperature by will power alone. In a process that Noakes has dubbed ""anticipatory thermogenesis"", Pugh can raise his body temperature to a feverish 38.4 C, some 1.5 degrees above normal body temperature. Noakes first noted this extraordinary ability during a training session. Before entering the water, Pugh cast his mind back to a traumatic parachuting accident he witnessed when he was a soldier in the British army, reliving the event in detail. Noakes recorded an increase in Pugh's body temperature and over the next fortnight, as Pugh was exposed to more cold-water swims, he was able to increase his temperature even further, peaking at 38.4 C. These days, before Pugh braves sub-zero waters he listens to U.S.rapper Eminem, gets himself into an aggressive state of mind and drives up his internal temperature. Once he hits the water, it's all about mental strength. Noakes told CNN ""The moment you dive into cold water your temperature drops and the brain sends a message to get out of the water. The first thing Pugh has to do is control that response. What happens is that I become his brain, so he says 'fine, as long as Dr Noakes allows me to swim, it's safe and I must just ignore what my brain is telling me.'"" Achieving that level of willpower doesn't come easily. While Pugh does an hour of cold-water swimming a day, he devotes four hours a day to mind training. His technique is to visualize his swim from beginning to end. ""I can taste salt water in my mouth. I can hear the sounds of the engines, of Tim Noakes screaming at me. I can feel ice burning my skin, I can smell the sea air. I absolutely live that moment. I have swum the North Pole hundreds of times in my mind,"" he told CNN. If the Arctic swim was intended to highlight shrinking polar ice caps, Pugh acknowledges that there's still plenty of work to do on that front and he now speaks on environmental issues all over the world. In 2008 Pugh founded the Polar Defense Project with the aim of protecting the Arctic and of encouraging world leaders to take action to stop climate change. As well the risk of polar melting, Pugh sees an Arctic treaty as essential to prevent the exploitation of the North Pole for oil and gas. As Pugh put it after completing his Arctic swim, ""I'm relieved that it's over. Now the real work begins.""",0.5815575,3301
124,"MOUNT KENYA, Kenya (CNN) -- For as long as anyone cares to remember, the pastoralists of Kenya's Rift Valley have fled with their herds to the fertile slopes of Mount Kenya when times are tough. Hundreds of dead cattle litter the slopes of Mount Kenya, fatally weakened by long treks to the region. When the rains failed this year they set off once again in search of water and pasture -- but they found only despair. ""I could have stayed home, or I could have come here, but it is all the same. All that you find is death,"" said Peraguan Lesagut, an aging pastoralist who came five months ago with his herd. After years of persistent drought Lesagut left his two wives and 16 children and drove 200 cattle to the foothills of Mount Kenya -- Africa's second highest summit. Now, only 40 are left; the rest succumbing to cold, disease and exposure. Across the folds of this mountain everyone has the same story. Hundreds of dead cattle dot the forests, young herdsmen try to coax ailing calves onto their feet, knowing that if they don't get up, they will die. ""I am hopeless because I have seen almost all of my animals die,"" Lesagut said. ""If the rains are delayed for even another week two, then I will lose everything."" Millions of Kenyans are facing the same stark reality. The World Food Program (WFP) says that, together with the Kenyan government, they will need to feed 3.8 million people across the country. Successive years of failed crops, drought and erratic rains caused by climate change have all had an impact. Somalia, Ethiopia and Djibouti all face similar crises. Despite this, the U.N. agency says that its emergency programs are facing massive shortfalls. ""We are facing a really difficult situation. We realize that the world economic crisis has affected the amount that countries can give to us,"" says WFP spokesperson Gabrielle Menezes, ""But at the same time we are seeing an awful situation in Kenya. If we don't start feeding people now, things are only going to get worse."" For many Kenyan farmers, the situation is already bad enough. Eunice Wairimu has seen four successive crops fail. This is harvest time in Kenya but her corn plants barely reach her knees and she will have to use her meager harvest as animal feed. ""I don't even like to go to my farm because I become very upset,"" she said. ""There is nothing for me to get there for my family."" Wairimu used to sell her surplus, but now she depends on food rations. She accepts them grudgingly. ""According to our tribal culture, we aren't used to being given food. We have always been willing to work hard. If it is the will of God to bring rain, he will bring rain. But he also brings drought.""",0.57998306,8177

""It is about global action for a global climate treaty and a better future for humankind."" The campaign is a collaboration between a number of the world's largest communications companies. The strategy and creative concept for the Hopenhagen idea came from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather team; digital framework and direction were developed by MDC Partners' Colle+McVoy; and the global PR and messaging plans are spearheaded by Omnicom Group's Ketchum. Michael Lee, executive director of the International Advertising Association called the coalition of media companies involved ""unprecedented,"" adding that it was ""testament to the significance the industry places on the need for action to address climate change."" According to the campaign brief, the aim is to change from the idea that we are just ""coping"" with global climate challenges to ""hoping"" and ultimately acting to combat the perils of climate change. The Hopenhagen Web site will be the center of an open source campaign where the public can send messages to the delegates of the UN summit meeting as well as raise awareness and debate issues. While the Web site will be developed as the months go by, the IAA also hopes that businesses, governments and NGOs engage in the campaign as well to create a broad global community with shared goals.

126,"THE EVERGLADES, Florida (CNN) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida's Everglades. The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular. Reptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades. ""The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,"" he said. Wasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed. And breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs. They are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say. The travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading. ""It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,"" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python. Volunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons. A ""Python Patrol"" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find. ""The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,"" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys. It is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners. ""These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,"" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle. The state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski. Twenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure. What Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move. When he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed. On one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him. Finally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. ""Yeah, baby! Hee ha! Look at the size of this one,"" he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck. He got out and picked up the brownish-green snake, which immediately coiled around his arm. ""This isn't a big one,"" he said, but as he got a closer look, he did not deny that it was a good one: ""At least 12 [feet.]"" Wasilewski has a soft spot for these species, and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them. He says it is not the snakes' fault that they ended up in the Everglades, but he acknowledges the problems they are causing on the Florida ecosystem and the need to do something. ""One down, 100,000 to go,"" he said.",0.5788245,6275
128,"(CNN) -- Environmental saviors can turn up in the most unexpected places. For the answer to our global waste management crisis, we need only look as far as our back gardens, for example. Forty million manure worms are being put to use in Sydney to treat its sewage. That's what proponents of vermicomposting will tell us, anyway. Vermicomposting is the art of composting using worms -- and it is worms, apparently, who could save us yet. Worms are nature's waste disposal units. Or rather, it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units, as they don't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful: nutrient-rich compost. Earthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly, in this context: The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus, which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting, according to CityFarmer.org. Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day, but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process, according to The Ecologist. There are a lot of them, too. You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land, according to NatureWatch, their population doubling in size every one-two months. And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves, stems and dead roots in one year, ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process. What they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients. According to NatureWatch, earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen, seven times as much phosphorous, 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more ""beneficial bacteria"" than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place. Literally speaking, what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out. Utilizing 'black gold' It is no surprise why these worms' byproducts are often referred to as ""black gold,"" this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world's agricultural soil has become ""seriously degraded,"" according to the UK Soil Association. Worm compost: . Just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days, according to ScienceDaily. And plants love it. Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting, by as much as 40 percent for broccoli, 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots, according to The Ecologist. According to the World Waste Survey, compiled by Veolia Environmental Services, we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004. And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted. Around 32 percent of the European Union's annual municipal waste (around 120 million tons) is food and garden waste, according to Waste Management World. And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill, emitting methane into the atmosphere. As local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste, vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places. In Hong Kong, none other than fast-food chain McDonald's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day, according to the Reuters news service. McDonald's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to Hong Kong's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent, Reuters reports. Other companies to have experimented with worm composting include Ikea in the U.S. state of Illinois, where, according to Treehugger.com, it is conducting vermicomposting trials. If all goes well, it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent, the site says. As it happens, we have had this knowledge for centuries. Aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the ""intestines of the soil,"" according to The New York Times, which also points out that Cleopatra was another devotee, bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected. Charles Darwin admired their land-tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them. ""It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures,"" he mused, according to The New York Times. Greenhouse gas emitters . What Darwin, Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however, is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste. Scientists in India have found that worms' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure. According to the Indian newspaper, India Together, researchers in Gujarat have found that worms can ""detox"" the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste. The method is ideal for industries -- such as paper, food processing, oil, textiles, dairy, distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge, Indian researchers say. But even with vermicomposting, something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around, there's a downside -- and it's a rather large one. It turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size, reports the UK's Telegraph newspaper. ""The emissions that come from these worms can actually be 290 times more potent than carbon dioxide and 20 times more potent than methane,"" the Telegraph quotes Jim Frederickson, an Open University research fellow.

129,"(CNN) -- Hidden under a quaint resort 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, lies a treasure trove of potential energy that's free and available 24/7. ""Imagineer"" Bernie Karl and his wife, Connie, own Chena Hot Springs Resort near Fairbanks, Alaska. Alaskan entrepreneur Bernie Karl has pioneered modern technology to tap into one of Earth's oldest energy resources: hot water. Karl, 56, likes to call himself an ""imagineer."" Using imagination to fuel his engineering ambitions, this tenacious thinker and self-starter has figured out a way to generate electricity using water that's the temperature of a cup of coffee -- about 165 degrees Fahrenheit. ""There's more opportunity now than there has ever been in the history of man, but we have to reinvent ourselves,"" Karl said. Karl was determined to reinvent the way he consumed energy after he and his wife, Connie, purchased the Chena Hot Springs Resort from the state of Alaska in 1998. ""After we purchased the hot spring, I couldn't believe it, the swimming pool and the hot spring were being heated by diesel fuel, 1,000 gallons every month!"" Karl said. To slash costs and to use resources that were right under his nose, Karl invented a portable geothermal power plant. In a little more than three years, Karl and his wife have severed the facility's dependence on diesel fuel and have saved $625,000, he said. Karl's partnered with the Department of Energy to fund half of a $1.4 million exploration project to find and characterize the geothermal resources at Chena Hot Springs. ""It's a model for what you can do,"" said Karl. Karl developed his tenacity from growing up as the sixth child of 16 siblings on a farm outside of Peoria, Illinois. He said his parents taught him hard work, how to recycle his clothes and shoes, and how to compost food and farm wastes. In the late 1970s, Karl was active in gold mining in Alaska's Central District, and he established the state's largest recycling facility in 1984, he said. Many of  his ideas stem from finding alternative ways to use and reuse resources he already has at his fingertips. After acquiring the 400-acre resort, Karl began trapping water from the underground hot springs, which produce enough power to heat the facility's greenhouses year-round. Most recently, Karl has turned his invention into a separate business by contracting with Peppermill hotel and casino in Reno, Nevada, to build a similar system there. His portable geothermal generator units cost from $350,000 to $375,000, each with the potential to generate enough power for 250 average American homes per year. 'Hot taps' His energy-generating machine lies on a flatbed truck and can be hooked up to oil and gas wells or other heat-emitting sources to generate electricity. Karl adds a branch connection to an oil or gas pipeline, and the process begins when he ""hot taps"" into waste water coming through the pipes. The hot water enters the tubes of an evaporator encased in a common refrigerant found in many air conditioning systems. As the hot water passes through the evaporator, it begins to boil the refrigerant in the casing surrounding the tubes. The heat given off by the boiling refrigerant then causes an attached turbine to spin, which jump-starts a generator, producing electrical power. Next, cooling water enters from another source, recondensing the vapor refrigerant into a liquid. A pump pushes the liquid refrigerant back to the evaporator, so the cycle can start again. The difference in temperatures drives the entire ""binary system."" This setup works exactly the opposite of a refrigerator. ""Chena Hot Springs is home to the lowest-temperature geothermal resource to be used for commercial power production in the world,"" Karl said. ""Oil companies don't drill wells for water, but they have some 5,000 kilowatts of geothermal power at their disposal in unused oil wells. Let's pick the low-hanging fruit and use the wells we have for oil for geothermal power,"" he said. Citing a 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, Karl said harnessing just 2 percent of Earth's internal energy could provide 2,000 times more energy than the entire planet currently consumes -- all free of polluting greenhouse gas emissions. ""Everything goes back, there is no pollution, no smokestack,"" he said. ""We are going to go recycle oil wells and recycle water and put it back in the ground."" Sizzle from the center of the Earth . Though Karl's lower-temperature approach is new, for more than a century, people have been trying to generate electricity from the heat that sizzles from the center of the Earth -- using it to cook, bathe and for electricity. In fact, the word ""geothermal"" comes from the Greek words geo (Earth) and therme (heat). ""We've determined that heat mining can be economical in the short term, based on a global analysis of existing geothermal systems, an assessment of the total U.S. resource and continuing improvements in deep-drilling and reservoir stimulation technology,"" said MIT professor Jefferson W. Tester. In a 2007 study, professors at MIT found that mining the huge amounts of heat that reside as stored thermal energy in the Earth's hard rock crust could supply a substantial portion of the electricity the United States will need in the future, probably at competitive prices and with minimal environmental impact. ""... if we just drill deep enough, most of the U.S. can be transformed into a huge geothermal power zone while drastically reducing the nation's carbon footprint,"" the MIT report said. Widespread geothermal power fuels electricity in a couple dozen countries, with the small island nation of Iceland leading the pack. An unusual abundance of geothermal sources creates 30 percent of Iceland's energy, according to its National Energy Authority. ""Imagination is so important,"" said Karl, whose resort houses 65 employees and can house 210 guests at maximum capacity. ""If Bernie Karl, one of the smallest mom-and-pop operators in the world, can do these things, then why can't all of us?""",0.5780905,7697
130,"(CNN) -- Clouds of black smoke from burning plastic hang over the sites of Nigeria's vast dumps, as tiny figures pick their way through slicks of oily water, past cracked PC monitors and television screens. Toxins from dumped electronics in developing countries has been seen as a growing problem. But it isn't just a cut from broken glass these mainly young scavengers are risking. Much of the discarded electronic kit contains tiny -- but valuable -- quantities of aluminum, copper, cadmium and other minerals, all of which can be sold on, if they can be recovered. However they also contain highly toxic materials, which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers. ""People living and working on and around the dump sites, many of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health, including cancer, damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children,"" Kim Schoppink, Toxics Campaigner at Greenpeace, told CNN. ""The open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins."" No studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in Nigeria, but in 2008 a Greenpeace report on similar dumps in nearby Ghana confirmed that high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon. A Chinese academic report published in ""Environmental Health Perspectives"" in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby. There is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for ""e-waste"" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics. Some of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market. According to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year. In 2008 a Greenpeace study, ""Not in My Backyard"", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent. Extrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites. But much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped. It's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading. The volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste. Each one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years. There seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market. ""Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,"" said Schoppink. ""It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem. ""The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it. The export of e-waste from the EU is illegal under the Basel Convention and the Waste Shipment Directive, but the laws are not being sufficiently implemented. In the U.S., there is no such law banning this practice. ""In Nigeria the government is talking about stopping imports, but there has been no progress on this to date."" Signs of progress . There are calls from environmental groups likes Greenpeace for electronics producers to do more to phase out their use of hazardous substances, and there are some signs of progress. Several electronics companies already make products using fewer hazardous substances, and others, including Nokia, Philips and Samsung are setting up voluntary collection and recycling systems in countries where they are not legally obliged to. Apple claims its products are now almost entirely free of the worst toxic chemicals. ""If producers continue to use hazardous chemicals in their electronics and to fail to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products, e-waste will continue to be dumped in developing countries,"" said Schoppink. ""The pollution and related health problems in countries where e-waste is dumped will increase massively as the amount of electronics used worldwide is growing exponentially and the number of countries used as dump sites will grow."" But while the developing world needs the U.S. and EU to take responsibility for their waste, it also needs their discarded computers to train and build a 21st century workforce. ""Nobody is arguing that Africa should be denied access to computers,"" said Tony Roberts, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Computer Aid International, a charity licensed by the UK Environment Agency, which provides recycled computers to developing countries to improve education and healthcare. ""Technical colleges and universities are always short of resources. It is, of course, essential to developing economies escaping poverty to have access to affordable modern technology."" Computer Aid works to close the digital divide between the north and southern hemispheres and offers corporations, including Coca Cola, as well as individuals, a positive way of disposing of electronics. They also believe learning about responsibility for that technology is a crucial part of the exchange. ""Computer Aid argues that, in addition to the PCs, it is essential to also build the skills, knowledge and operating capacity in every country to manage responsible re-use programs and environmentally sound end-of-life recycling."" In the end, this is about everyone involved -- particularly the developed nations -- taking responsibility for their waste. ""It is clear that companies have a moral obligation to treat Africa in exactly the same way that they do, say, Germany,"" said Roberts. Until then, toxic black smoke will continue to cast a shadow over lives across the developing world.",0.57808286,7516
132,"(CNN) -- The earthquake in Sichuan, southwestern China, last May left around 69,000 people dead and 15 million people displaced. Now ecologists have assessed the earthquake's impact on biodiversity and the habitat for some of the last existing wild giant pandas. Giant pandas are more endangered than ever since the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. According to the report published in ""Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment"", 23 percent of the pandas' habitat in the study area was destroyed, and fragmentation of the remaining habitat could hinder panda reproduction. The Sichuan region is designated as a global hotspot for biodiversity, according to Conservation International. Home to more than 12,000 species of plants and 1,122 species of vertebrates, the area includes more than half of the habitat for the Earth's wild giant panda population, said study lead author Weihua Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. ""We estimate that above 60 percent of the wild giant panda population was affected to some extent by the earthquake,"" said Xu in the report. In an effort to develop conservation strategies for the panda's remaining habitat, Xu and his colleagues used satellite imagery to determine the pandas' habitat loss and fragmentation in the South Minshan region, which is adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter. Since forests are the main vegetation type used by the pandas, the authors compared forested areas in satellite images from September 2007, before the earthquake, to images after the earthquake and its aftershocks, in July 2008. The authors then combined results based on these satellite data with criteria that make forests suitable for pandas, including elevation, slope incline and presence of bamboo. Their analyses revealed that more than 354 square kilometers, or about 23 percent, of the pandas' habitat was converted to bare land. Of the remaining habitat, the researchers found that large habitat areas had been fragmented into smaller, disconnected patches, which Xu says can be just as harmful as habitat destruction. ""It is probable that habitat fragmentation has separated the giant panda population inhabiting this region, which could be as low as 35 individuals,"" said Xu. ""This kind of isolation increases their risk of extinction in the wild, due in part to a higher likelihood of inbreeding."" Xu and his colleagues proposed a plan to encourage pandas to move between patches using specially protected corridors. They also recommend areas to be protected outside of nature reserves and that post-earthquake relocation of affected towns takes panda habitat into consideration. ""It is vital to the survival of this species that measures are taken to protect panda habitat outside nature reserves,"" said Xu. ""Giant pandas in this region are more vulnerable than ever to human disturbance, including post-earthquake reconstruction and tourism. When coupled with these increasing human activities, natural disasters create unprecedented challenges for biodiversity conservation.""",0.57677627,6606
133,"(CNN) -- Philanthropist and billionaire businessman Ted Turner will receive 88 disease-free bison from Yellowstone National Park, Montana's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks confirmed Tuesday. The bison, which were facing slaughter, will be transferred for breeding to Turner's ""Green Ranch,"" west of Bozeman, Montana, from a quarantine facility. ""The Green Ranch emerged as the best option we have for these bison right now,"" said Ken McDonald, said the state agency's wildlife bureau chief in Helena, Montana. ""It gives us time to evaluate the social and biological factors that will come into play as we begin to plan for the future of bison management in Montana."" For several years, the bison were quarantined and spared from slaughter after concerns about brucellosis disease, an infectious disease caused by contact with animals carrying the bacteria called brucella. All quarantined bison delivered to Turner's property, along with 25 percent of their offspring, will be returned to the state wildlife agency at the conclusion of the agreement, which will last up to five years, the release said. Turner Enterprises' Green Ranch proposal describes 12,000 acres of suitable habitat, excellent handling facilities, years of experience with bison and secure living space for the animals. The ranch also will participate in continued disease testing and monitoring conducted by state and federal officials, the release said. According to the Turner Enterprises Inc.

134,"Vero Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Louis Schacht's family has been growing citrus in Vero Beach, Florida, for 60 years, contributing to a multibillion-dollar industry. But this year, he's worried. The winter weather blasting much of the country has made it to Florida, and the cold front now moving through is expected to last longer than usual. That could prove disastrous for Schacht and his fellow growers at the peak of the picking season. A chill can enhance the taste of the oranges and grapefruit that the Schacht family business grows and ships around the world. But if the temperature drops to 28 degrees Fahrenheit or below and stays there for four hours, fruit across Florida could be frozen and the crop destroyed. ""If it stays just above freezing, it can really help sweeten the fruit, but it's a fine line to walk. If it gets too cold, you can definitely have some damage,"" Schacht said. He has flooded his 280-acre grove in a bid to protect his fruit, as have larger growers across the state. ""What that does is create a little layer of warmth, usually about 20 to 25 feet from the surface, which is all we really need,"" Schacht said. And Schacht said that's just about all he can do. He said the fate of his fruit is now out of his hands. ""We've basically done what we can do,"" he said. ""You say a prayer and go to bed."" CNNMoney.com: Will prices rise for orange juice?

135,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The renewable energy sector has received a boost with the inauguration of the world's first commercial wave power project off the Portuguese coast. It is hoped that the Pelamis Wave Energy Converters will provide energy for 15,000 homes. Developed by a Scottish engineering company, Pelamis Wave Power Limited, the Pelamis Wave Energy Converters (PWEC) have been towed into position three miles off the coast of Agucadoura in north Portugal. The first phase of the project is using three PWEC to generate 2.25 megawatts of power at a cost of nine million euros. If successful, a second phase will see energy generation rise to 21 megawatts from a further 25 machines providing electricity for 15,000 Portuguese homes. The project is a joint venture between Pelamis Wave Power Limited, Babcock and Brown Ltd -- a global specialist asset manager, Energias de Portugal (EDP) and Portuguese energy group EFACEC. Named after the sea snake Pelamis, each machine measures 140 meters in length, is 3.5 meters wide and sits partially submerged in the sea. Babcock and Brown's Anthony Kennaway explained to CNN how the PWEC work. ""Effectively what you have is four long sections making up one machine. Between those sections are three small generating motors,"" he said. ""The four sections are all joined by hydraulic rams. As the waves run through the machine it pushes the rams in and out. The action of the rams going to and fro pushes hydraulic fluid into a high-pressure reservoir. That high-pressure reservoir then releases the fluid at a steady rate through a generating motor."" This power is fed down to a cable on the sea bed which then links back to a sub-station on shore where it is converted into useable electricity. The PWEC are, of course, reliant on the weather. Depending on the wave resource, Pelamis predict that the machines will on average produce 25-40 percent of their full power output over the course of a year. When the full array of 25 machines are in place it is calculated that around 60,000 tons of CO2 will be displaced. If wave power was fully exploited, the British Wind Energy Association estimates that one-two billion tons of CO2 could be displaced every year. Ian Fells, emeritus professor of energy conversion at Newcastle University in England, gave this latest development in wave power a cautious welcome. ""It's extraordinarily difficult to design a machine that will cope with the extreme violence of waves. Some wave machines are under the surface all the time -- but they are not as well developed as yet. Pelamis lies in the surface and it remains to be seen how successful it will be,"" he told CNN. ""But good luck to them. We'll just have to see how it operates over time and how it copes with serious weather conditions."" Professor Fells, a founding chairman of the New and Renewable Energy Center (NaREC) at Blyth, Northumberland, is convinced of the potential of wave power engineering but says it is still in its infancy. ""A few years ago when I was talking about a 500-kilowatt Wavegen machine, I was asked by a reporter how many of these we would need to replace the two nuclear power stations in Scotland, and the answer is 10,000. That puts things into perspective.""",0.5756541,6678
136,"TAIJI, Japan (CNN) -- Mention a dolphin to someone in the United States and they'll think about a trip to Sea World or the 1960s-era TV program ""Flipper."" Residents in Taiji, Japan, have been hunting dolphins for hundreds of years. Talk about a dolphin in rural Japan and some people think of dinner. Fishermen hunt dolphins about every day in Taiji, a town of about 3,000 in southwestern Japan that juts into the Pacific Ocean. Locals know they offend Western sensibilities by eating dolphins, but they say it's a tradition hundreds of years old. And they say outsiders have no more right to tell them to stop eating dolphins than they would have to demand that Westerners stop slaughtering, say, chickens or cows.  Watch fishermen catch dolphins » . ""I know there are many different ways of thinking in different societies, but for us who've been eating this for a long time ... it's an awkward thing to be criticized for,"" says Kayoko Tanaka, a retired middle school teacher. ""I either fry dolphin meat or turn it into a stew."" That disgusts Ric O'Barry, a 68-year-old retired dolphin trainer from Miami who makes a second home in Taiji, where he goes to unusual lengths to fight against the tide of local tradition. O'Barry sometimes dresses as a woman or wears a large surgical mask to disguise his Western identity on trips to spots overlooking the ocean. He prowls the cliffs with a video camera, hoping to catch fishermen in the act with footage that could stir emotions and raise awareness in the West. ""This here is ground zero for the largest slaughter of dolphins on planet Earth,"" says O'Barry, who trained five dolphins to play ""Flipper"" on the TV series of that name. ""It's absolutely barbaric and it needs to stop."" He says the dolphins face a cruel fate. ""It takes a very long time to die. They bleed to death. And some of them are dragged in the boats with hooks while they're still alive,"" he says. ""Many of them are gutted while they're still alive."" Looming beyond questions of whether the slaughter is humane, however, are larger and more complex questions of culture and perspective. To some puzzled people in rural Japan, the question comes down to this: What's the difference between killing and eating a dolphin and killing and eating a fish? Or a chicken? Or a cow? Most Japanese do not eat dolphins -- it's common in a few small fishing villages -- but the government respects the rights of people in towns like Taiji, says Joji Morishita, the international negotiator for Japan's Fisheries Agency. Many Japanese consider the deer a sacred messenger from the gods, he says, but they would never suggest that people in other parts of the world stop venturing into the woods on a quest for venison, Morishita says. ""We don't like to play God to say this animal is just for food and this is not,"" he says. ""Because we know nation to nation we have totally different ideas."" That's obvious in the growing clash between Australia and Japan over whale hunting. Japanese ships crisscross the Antarctic Ocean each winter to capture and kill up to 1,000 whales. Whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts. Legal justifications aside, however, the whale hunts offend many people in Australia, where new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has turned up the political pressure on Japan. His government has dispatched a customs ship to monitor and videotape the whalers. And Rudd says Australia could even file charges against Japan in an international court to try to stop the whaling. Back in Taiji, the fishermen are well aware of the Western sentiment that motivates whaling opponents. They realize the danger to their way of life that can come with prying cameras from other countries. When CNN trained its cameras on fishermen gutting some freshly killed dolphins, the fishermen erected some tarps to obstruct the view. Representatives of the Taiji Fishermen's Union declined CNN requests for an on-camera interview. So did the town's mayor and several others. And O'Barry says he's gotten into a few shouting matches with fishermen, who resent him and his camera. So what does O'Barry say to their claim that he has no right to tell them to abandon a tradition that has flourished in their small corner of the world for more than 400 years? ""If someone came to my hometown and told me what to do, what to eat, I'd be outraged,"" he says. ""But that's not going to stop me from doing it. I mean, tradition? It used to be traditional for women not to vote. So do we keep that going because it's traditional and cultural? Of course not."" Complicating the debate are findings suggesting that eating dolphins may not be good for one's health. The Japanese government said in 2005 that bottlenose dolphin meat contains 12 times more mercury than blue fin tuna -- high levels of mercury in fish can cause health problems in pregnant women and young children. A city councilman in Taiji, Junichiro Yamashita, grew so concerned about mercury levels that he persuaded locals schools to stop serving dolphin meat at lunch. He even plucked some of his hair, sent it off for testing and discovered that it contained seven times as much mercury as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. The mercury findings have not swayed Masaru Matsushita, a Taiji fish dealer. He says that dolphin activists like O'Barry only see their needs without understanding the culture in his town. ""I understand that they think the dolphin in a cute animal, and I agree they're cute doing performances,"" he says, ""but it is our culture to eat dolphins."" E-mail to a friend .",0.57488066,2693
138,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Layoffs for sea lions? Furloughs for frogs? Is there no job security, anywhere? State budget cuts mean New York's 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums will lose $9.1 million in funding. The recession may be coming to a zoo near you. State budget cuts mean many zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose crucial state funding for their exhibits. New York's 76 zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose $9.1 million in state funds next year. ""We're faced with this very difficult problem of firing the animals, as it were,"" said Steve Sanderson, the CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium. They will lose $3 million to budget cuts. The Bronx Zoo has made a short video posted on its Web site www.bronxzoo.com/ to draw attention to the cuts. In the video, the zoo director fires a porcupine and a frog. ""I am sure you have heard that Gov. [David] Paterson's proposed budget will mean severe cuts here at the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium,"" the zoo director says. ""Next year, all 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums in the state will lose all of their state funding. There is no easy way to say this: Even though you bring record numbers of people to New York and help the economy, we are going to have to let you go."" Firing a porcupine and a frog may be a cute way to get publicity for their budget woes, but it's a serious matter and zoo officials say the recession will certainly affect the animals. Zoo officials say some collections with ""short life cycles"" will not be replaced when they die, and other animals could be sent to other zoos or wildlife sanctuaries. The state of New York funds just 2.7 percent of the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium's budget, but zoo officials say it will be difficult to make up. Between the state budget cuts, the loss in the value of their endowment and fewer people renewing memberships -- times are so tough for the zoo and aquarium -- they say they may lay off 120 to 130 people. ""Two-thirds of our budget is people, and so two-thirds of the cuts will come in cutting positions,"" Sanderson said. ""And we'll also cut back what we provide in the way of education and entertainment and nature experiences for people. So it affects everything."" Zoo officials questioned the state's priorities. But just about everybody getting taxpayer funds has to cut back. Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the New York State Budget Office told CNN the cuts are regrettable but necessary considering the state's current financial crisis. Citing a ""dramatic reduction in revenue,"" Gordon said, ""Every entity that receives state funds must do what the state has done, which is to review its operations and identify ways to operate at lower costs."" The Bronx Zoo isn't the only one affected; cutbacks are happening everywhere. The Los Angeles Zoo in California stopped work on its $42 million elephant exhibit last year, and there are big budget cuts for zoos in Maryland, Missouri and North Carolina.

140,"(CNN) -- It is midday and Geoff Lawton is hard at work at Zaytuna Farms in New South Wales, Australia. But the real work, he says, is going on inside the center of the compost. Geoff Lawton says that permaculture ""revs up"" systems of soil creation. ""There's lots of things breeding in there,"" Lawton says. Compost may not seem a sexy subject, but within this steaming pile, life is being created. ""There's organisms breathing and dying and reproducing very quickly,"" he says. ""It's all very hot and steamy."" That rich soil lays the groundwork for Lawton's revolutionary method of food production. It's called permaculture. Lawton's friend and mentor, Bill Mollison, developed the process back in the 1970s. Since then he and Lawton have traveled the globe preaching the value of permaculture and its aim to create harmony between the landscape and the people who live on it. ""Nature exists in an incredibly rich form, and enriching form and does so without any energy inputs from mankind,"" Lawton explains. ""Permaculture does the same thing."" ""We've taken the systems of soil creation and soil life and we've revved them up. We've speeded up nature itself and we've improved the system.""  Watch Geoff Lawton at work » . So what does it take to improve the system? Lawton says it's about rehabilitating areas that have been damaged by pollution or overuse by recycling nutrients and energy back into the soils. Permaculture also takes all the things we need -- our housing, energy sources, food and water supplies -- and tailors them to fit into the natural rhythms of the ecosystem. The idea is to work with, not against, nature. Lawton says that during the first few weeks and months you don't see the real benefits, but after a year to 18 months you really start to see the difference. ""Within two or three years you can see a system that is really something that's got great opportunities and possibilities,"" he said. The gardens at Zaytuna Farms bear fruit and vegetables of all that hard work. The real measure though isn't how it works, but where. Lawton claims this permaculture method can work anywhere in the world, including the desert. ""Almost all the deserts on earth at one point were forested,"" he said. ""They all have different types of oasis systems. What you're doing is picking different points in the desert and turning them into a rich oasis."" On a DVD created by the Permaculture Research Institute of Australia, Lawton shows us what happened when he took this method to places like Morocco and Jordan -- just 80 kilometers from the Dead Sea. ""People were amazed to see an area that was salty, sandy ground, turn into a lush green forest, that had mushrooms growing from the soil,"" Lawton said. The ability to ""green"" the desert is not only having an impact on the communities where these gardens are grown. Interest is also sprouting among young people. Dozens come to Zaytuna Farms every year to learn about the permaculture method. ""I've only been doing it a year and once you hit upon the principles it's basically observations,"" said intern Jonathan Chan. ""You have to look at the land and which way the wind is blowing and see where the sun angles are and design around that and it does seem quite simple."" For Chan it's as much about cultivating a new way of life as it is about cultivating the land. ""I think people are getting to the point where they have to make change and permaculture is a good direction to go,"" he said. Still, permaculture isn't without its critics. They argue the method is time-consuming in the early stages and that makes the system hard to get off the ground in many places. It can be made even more difficult if the people living around the site aren't familiar with the process. But Lawton argues the time and energy expended in a permaculture garden is offset by the quality of the experience, and the richness of the end result. ""A good organic farmer works a thousand hours a year. The industrial mankind works two thousand to three thousand hours a year. What do we have to show for it? Gadgets. ""We don't have community, we don't have clean water, clean air or sensible housing. As negative as we currently are, we can be equally positive,"" Lawton said. ""It's not just self-reliance or self-sufficiency, it's absolute abundance.""",0.57033736,6792
141,"(WIRED) -- The wind blowing through the streets of Manhattan couldn't power the city, but wind machines placed thousands of feet above the city theoretically could. A prototype of a high-altitude wind turbine made by Magenn Power. The first rigorous, worldwide study of high-altitude wind power estimates that there is enough wind energy at altitudes of about 1,600 to 40,000 feet to meet global electricity demand a hundred times over. The very best ground-based wind sites have a wind-power density of less than 1 kilowatt per square meter of area swept. Up near the jet stream above New York, the wind power density can reach 16 kilowatts per square meter. The air up there is a vast potential reservoir of energy, if its intermittency can be overcome. Even better, the best high-altitude wind-power resources match up with highly populated areas including North America's Eastern Seaboard and China's coastline. ""The resource is really, really phenomenal,"" said Christine Archer of Cal State University-Chico, who co-authored a paper on the work published in the open-access journal Energies.""There is a lot of energy up there, but it's not as steady as we thought. It's not going to be the silver bullet that will solve all of our energy problems, but it will have a role."" For centuries, we've been using high-density fossil fuels, but peaking oil supplies and climate concerns have given new life to green technologies. Unfortunately, renewable energy is generally diffuse, meaning you need to cover a lot of area to get the energy you want. So engineers look for renewable resources that are as dense as possible. On that score, high-altitude wind looks very promising. Wind's power -- energy which can be used to do work like spinning magnets to generate electricity -- varies with the cube of its speed. So, a small increase in wind speed can lead to a big increase in the amount of mechanical energy you can harvest. High-altitude wind blows fast, is spread nicely across the globe, and is easier to predict than terrestrial wind. These properties have led inventors and scientists to cast their hopes upward, where strong winds have long been known to blow, as Etzler's dreamy quote shows. During the energy shocks of the 1970s, when new energy ideas of all kinds were bursting forth, engineers and schemers patented several designs for harnessing wind thousands of feet in the air. The two main design frameworks they came up with are still with us today. The first is essentially a power plant in the sky, generating electricity aloft and sending it down to Earth via a conductive tether. The second is more like a kite, transmitting mechanical energy to the ground, where generators turn it into electricity. Theoretically, both approaches could work, but nothing approaching a rigorous evaluation of the technologies has been conducted. The Department of Energy had a very small high-altitude wind program, which produced some of the first good data about the qualities of the wind up there, but it got axed as energy prices dropped in the 1980s and Reagan-era DOE officials directed funds elsewhere. The program hasn't been restarted, despite growing attention to renewables, but that's not because it's considered a bad idea. Rather, it is seen as just a little too far out on the horizon. ""We're very much aimed these days at things that we can fairly quickly commercialize, like in the next 10 years or so,"" said National Renewable Energy Laboratory spokesperson George Douglas. Startups like KiteGen, Sky Windpower, Magenn, and Makani (Google's secretive fundee) have come into the space over the last several years, and they seem to be working on much shorter timelines. ""We are not that far from working prototypes,"" Archer said, though she noted that the companies are all incredibly secretive about the data from their testing. Magenn CFO Barry Monette said he expects ""first revenue"" next year when they sell ""two to four"" working prototypes of their blimpy machine, which will operate at much lower altitudes. ""We do think that we're going to be first [to market], unless something happens,"" Monette said. In the long term, trying to power entire cities with machines like this would be difficult, largely because even in the best locations, the wind will fail at least 5 percent of the time. ""This means that you either need backup power, massive amounts of energy storage, or a continental- or even global-scale electricity grid to assure power availability,"" said co-author Ken Caldeira, an ecologist at Stanford University. ""So, while high-altitude wind may ultimately prove to be a major energy source, it requires substantial infrastructure."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

143,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Are circus elephants abused? Or are the elephants under the big top healthy and thriving in a caring environment? Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey elephants pass the U.S. Capitol in a parade this week in Washington. That's the issue a federal judge must decide in a 9-year-old legal dispute pitting four animal rights groups against the nation's most famous circus, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. Closing arguments will be heard Wednesday in the case in which the circus is accused of mistreating its 54 Asian elephants, which are protected under the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Under the law, endangered species cannot be ""harmed, harassed, wounded, injured or killed."" The circus ""is in fact in violation of the federal Endangered Species Act as a result of their routine practices that they use on the elephants,"" according to Tracy Silverman, general counsel for the Animal Welfare Institute. Silverman alleges that the circus uses ""bull hooks"" and electrical prods called ""hot shots"" to train and manage the elephants and that handlers chain the elephants for extended periods of time. These practices violate federal law, Silverman says. But the circus says that no evidence was presented at the six-week trial that such tools as bull hooks and hot shots are used on elephants. ""Ringling Bros.' practices are well known to the federal government who regulates their business,"" says Ringling Bros. attorney Michelle Pardo. The tools the circus uses to handle animals ""are time-tested, approved and commonly used,"" she added. Pardo insists the trial evidence ""showed the elephants are healthy, well cared for and they're thriving in Ringling Bros. care."" Besides the Animal Welfare Institute, other groups involved in the suit are the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Fund for Animals and Born Free USA, acting with the Animal Protection Institute. While the animal rights groups allege the circus ""severely mistreats and abuses"" elephants, the circus says the animals are not only healthy but ""really do benefit from the enrichment that the circus provides."" No immediate ruling is expected from the judge.",0.5689032,4825
144,"(CNN) -- Meat is murder? Well, perhaps not for much longer. Artist Banksy has satirized modern farming and meat production; could in-vitro meat be a better option? A pioneering group of scientists are working to grow real animal protein in the laboratory, which they not only claim is better for animal welfare, but actually healthier, both for people and the planet. It may sound like science fiction, but this technology to create in-vitro meat could be changing global diets within ten years. ""Cultured meat would have a lot of advantages,"" said Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest. ""We could precisely control the amount of fat in meat. We could make ground beef with an ideal fatty acid ratio -- a hamburger that prevents heart attacks instead of causing them."" But it isn't just the possibility of creating designer ground beef with the fat profile of salmon that drives Matheny's work. Meat and livestock farming is also the source of many human diseases, which he claims would be far less common when the product is raised in laboratory conditions. ""We could reduce the risks of diseases like swine flu, avian flu, 'mad cow disease', or contamination from Salmonella,"" he told CNN. ""We could produce meat in sterile conditions that are impossible in conventional animal farms and slaughterhouses. And when we grow only the meat we can eat, it's more efficient. There's no need to grow the whole animal and lose 75 to 95 percent of what we feed it."" Conventional meat production is also hard on the environment. The contribution of livestock to climate change was recently highlighted by the United Nations' report, ""Livestock's Long Shadow"", while groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have demonstrated how soy farming for animal feed contributes to the destruction of the Amazon. In this context Matheny believes his project could significantly cut the environmental impact of meat production -- using much less water and producing far fewer greenhouse gases. ""We could reduce the environmental footprint of meat, which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector,"" says Matheny. Preliminary results from a study by Hanna Tuomisto, at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford, suggest that cultured meat would reduce the carbon emissions of meat production by more than 80 percent. Making cultured meat . In-vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered. For example, ""pork"" is made from pig ovaries retrieved from slaughterhouses, which are fertilized with pig semen, transforming them into embryos. They are then placed in a nutrient solution, where they grow and develop. It's a long way from the popular image of animals wandering round the farmyard in the sunshine, but then so is modern intensive farming. The factor that could take the research from the lab to the store and into refrigerators around the world is its remarkable commercial potential. According to New Harvest, meat is already estimated to be a $1 trillion global market, and demand is expected to double by 2050. With concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment growing the appeal of in vitro meat is obvious. Matheny told CNN that venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers have shown an interest in his technology, while Stegman, a sausage subsidiary of food giant Sara Lee, is a partner. The Netherlands' Government has also invested around $4 million in Dutch research into in-vitro meat production. But it isn't just the suits who are circling with their checkbooks out -- campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have announced a $1 million prize for the first commercially viable in vitro chicken product. The Humane Society of the United States has also been supportive. ""We think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers, sausages, nuggets, and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years,"" said Matheny. ""As with most technologies, successive generations should improve in price, quality, and acceptance. We don't think that matching the taste and texture of ground meats will be very difficult. Both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue. And conventional ground meat is typically highly processed. Chicken nuggets for instance, are made of something called 'meat slurry' -- it would be hard not to do better!"" Public attitude . But the public doesn't always blindly buy what companies believe they should, and acceptance of what is a very radical proposition certainly isn't a foregone conclusion. There are bound to be claims of ""Frankenfoods,"" and reaction against the work. ""Social acceptance isn't guaranteed, but we all want meat that's safer and healthier,"" he said. ""If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high. The more we learn about the health and environmental impact of conventional meat, the more cultured meat looks like a good alternative."" One obvious touchstone for how in-vitro-meat will be received by the public is perhaps the way GM crops were -- or were not - accepted around the world, something that Matheny draws encouragement from. ""What's interesting about the GM issue is that it has been controversial in some places, but is a non-issue for most consumers,"" he said. ""Most Americans are regularly eating GM foods. In any case, it's not necessarily the case that cultured meat would involve GM foods. ""We all want meat that's safer and healthier. If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm? ""Take hydroponic vegetables. We like the idea that they're produced in sterile water instead of dirt and manure. It's true that in-vitro meat isn't natural. Nor for that matter are hydroponic vegetables, or bread, or cheese, or wine. Raising 10,000 chickens indoors and pumping them full of drugs isn't natural, either, and it isn't healthy or safe. The more we learn about how meat is produced now, the more in-vitro meat looks like a better alternative."" Lab-produced meat also raises some ethical considerations. Kate McMahon, Friends of the Earth Energy and Transport campaigner, believes more attention should be paid to improving livestock conditions rather than developing in-vitro meat. ""At a time when hundreds of small-scale, sustainable farming operations are filing for bankruptcy every day, it is unethical to consider purchasing petri dish meat. Rather, we should be making it easier and more affordable to raise livestock in a safe, humane and ecologically sensitive manner,"" she told CNN. Gillian Madill, Genetics Technologies spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, thinks that clear parameters for in-vitro development need to put in place: ""If we can successfully develop these products, what is the defining line between lab-grown meat and natural animals?"" she told CNN. ""That is an especially important question since a high level of differentiation and tissue complexity is required to replicate muscle tissue that we use as meat. We need to draw clear lines in order to prevent the commodification of all life."" Ultimately the success of in-vitro meat may be less about consumer sensibilities and more about the hard realities of feeding a growing global population in a finite world. ""With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade, there's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology,"" said Matheny. ""Cultured meat offers one solution. Improved plant-based meat substitutes offer another. I expect both will be needed."" Test tube burgers? It seems you could be eating them sooner than you might expect. What do you think of in-vitro meat? Do you think it could be a solution to the problems connected to meat production and climate change? Let us know in the Sound Off box below.",0.568671,5581
145,"Remember the days when a washing machine lasted for decades? If it broke down it could be fixed. But now it seems it is cheaper to discard our broken products and buy new ones. The side effects of our throwaway society are ever-larger waste mountains festering with toxic chemicals and the depletion of natural resources such as rare metals. Europe produced 8.3 to 9.1 millions tons of waste from electrical projects in 2005. Product makers are responding by designing goods that have a reduced carbon footprint at their point of manufacture, but leading thinkers in the field of sustainable design believe that a radical re-think in the way we consume products is required if we want to halt the growing mountain of toxic waste piling up on the world's rubbish dumps. Figures recently announced by the U.N. University suggest the production of electronic and electrical products is running neck-and-neck with their disposal: An estimated 10.3 million tons of electronic products were put on the market in the European Union in 2005, while 8.3 to 9.1 million tons of waste from electrical products found their way into Europe's rubbish bins. Electronic and electrical products account for four percent of Europe's waste and the rate is growing at three times the speed of any other form of waste. What is sustainable design? Sustainable design is a reaction to the global environmental crisis. It aims to produce products, buildings and services, which have a low impact on climate change and the depletion of the world's resources. In industrial design this includes the use of recycled and recyclable materials; reducing pollution through cutting down the need for transportation, such as by using locally-sourced materials; making products which can be taken apart once they are discarded so that their parts that can be used again; and designing goods which use as little energy as possible while they are being made. While many companies are beginning to think of ways in which they can reduce their environmental impact during the manufacture of their products, many sustainable design experts believe that these measures are not enough to reduce the damage the constant manufacture of products is doing to the world's eco-system. A change in culture . ""Daily life is becoming increasingly mediated by electronic artifacts,"" says Jonathan Chapman, editor of Designers, Visionaries and Other Stories, a book which seeks to bring together new thinking on sustainable design. ""These products are great but it seems that as their popularity grows, their impermanence grows with it."" Chapman believes that true sustainability can only be achieved if we moderate our inclination to strive for the newest product, and he argues that the onus is on designers to initiate a shift away from a disposable culture. He proposes a model for consumer behavior based on a service economy -- that products are designed to last longer and to be fixed when they break; brands can make their profits by providing the services to ensure that this can be done. ""It's quite conceivable to make objects that don't necessarily make a profit at the point-of-sale but that, because their life-spans are extended and are punctuated with service and upgrade options, can generate turnover over long periods of time that is greater than making a small profit and having to remanufacture,"" he explains. He believes that consumers would be prepared to pay more for their electronic goods if they knew they would last longer. It is an economic model that would make most manufacturers choke, but it is an unfounded fear, says economist Andrew Charlton, author of Ozonomics: Inside the Myth of Australia's Economic Superheroes. ""The key thing to remember is that human desires know no bounds -- we are never satiated,"" he says. ""If we replace an expensive disposable product with a permanent one, that just frees up income to spend on other things. ""Ballpoint pens last longer than quills, tarred roads last longer than cobblestones -- and the economy moves on. Every time we satisfy one demand, another one comes along to take its place."" ""A quarter-inch hole"" But it's not enough to expect consumers to sign up to a longer-life model just because it is 'green', says Steve Bishop, head of sustainability at design firm IDEO. Consumers concerned with the sustainability of the products they buy still only make up a small fraction of the market and designers must incorporate energy-saving measures into mainstream thinking, with sustainability as a by-product. Marketing a product as environmentally friendly is ""really addressing a niche market,"" he argues. ""It's putting the responsibility on people and it's effectively guilting people into buying these things. It shouldn't be about guilt or sacrifice. It should be about connecting to people's values and what really matters to them."" Often what really matters to people is saving money. He cites as an example of sustainability-achieved-by-stealth some research IDEO made into the effectiveness of hybrid electric cars. They found that the single feature of the cars that maximized their energy-efficiency was not the variable transmission, the regenerative brakes or the electric motor but a small widget on the dashboard that measures fuel consumption and tells you when you are driving the car most efficiently. ""It's not so much that they are trying to be green as much as they are trying to get high score,"" Bishop concludes. Sustainability must understand and adapt to human behavior, not vice versa, is his verdict. ""People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole,"" Theodore Levitt, former marketing professor at Harvard Business School and author of Marketing Myopia, used to tell his students. Apple's iTunes software, a service which allows music fans to download audio files directly onto their computers, is an example of Levitt's analogy in action. While its main aim was to make listening to music easier, it has inadvertently become a sustainable design model by canceling the need for the compact disc. People still get their end-product -- listening to music -- but without the waste and unnecessary energy consumption that goes into manufacturing a physical item on which to store it. His point is that businesses will have to shift their goal posts and might even have to change the mentality that says that producing more products is the only way to make money. Making a real impact . Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important to the public and manufacturers may have to combine 'green' production techniques with a dramatic change in how consumers relate to the products they buy. ""The real impact happens when you integrate both those things - when you look at the scientific basis and reduce the energy footprint during production but you also look at the psychological and emotional factors during use,"" says Chapman. ""When you start to integrate like that, that's when you start to achieve sustainable design."" E-mail to a friend .",0.56865937,4651
146,"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- Moments after marine explorer Sylvia Earle finished her passionate plea to preserve vast stretches of the world's oceans at last year's TED conference, a foundation executive walked up to her and pledged a million dollars for the cause. It was one of nearly 400 offers of support Earle received after revealing the wish she wanted to be granted as a winner of the TED Prize, given by the nonprofit organization whose motto is ""Ideas worth spreading."" It grants the winners $100,000 and organizational support but the impact of the prize is typically magnified by the backing of the influential audience attending the conferences. On Wednesday, British celebrity chef and nutrition advocate Jamie Oliver will reveal his wish as the winner of the 2010 prize. ""Every year we're looking around for someone who can inspire the world to do something big and interesting,"" says Chris Anderson, who runs  TED with the title of curator. ""The issue of obesity, both in the US and worldwide, is a big deal, a shocking problem in a world where you've got a lot of people starving and a lot of people killing themselves by overeating... or eating the wrong things. We were interested in finding an inspirational figure who could address that."" Past TED prizes have gone to former President Bill Clinton, rock star and philanthropist Bono and biologist E.O. Wilson. Since 2005, TED has granted wishes to three people a year and continues to work with past winners on achieving their wishes. But this year, the only winner will be Oliver, who has built an empire of cooking shows, cookbooks and restaurants. Oliver, the 34-year-old son of the owners of a pub/restaurant in Essex, England, came to public attention when he starred in a BBC television series, ""The Naked Chef."" He has followed that up with many other series, including one on nutrition in America due to launch this spring on ABC. The chef branched out into advocacy with a ""Feed Me Better"" campaign for improved school lunches in the U.K. He presented a petition with more than 270,000 signatures to the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in 2005, and officials promised to spend an added 280 million pounds ($437 million) to improve school food quality. TED Prize winners typically keep their wishes secret until the conference. Anderson told CNN last week that he did not know what Oliver's wish is. ""The whole idea is that the winner can actually wish for anything. We're taking a bit of a gamble here, for all we know he could wish for a hot tub full of models."" The suspense is ""part of the magical nature of the prize ... that moment of unveiling is special and it excites people."" Oliver's not tipping his hand about his wish, saying  -- through a spokesman -- ""I humbly but passionately hope that my wish and my speech will inspire everyone in the room -- and watching on the Internet -- to take action on an issue that affects the whole world."" TED began in the 1980s as a conference in California focusing on technology, entertainment and design but has since expanded to include virtually any subject and conferences in other locations. Speakers, dressed informally, prowl a big stage -- there's no lectern -- and present their views as a clock ticks away the 18 minutes each is allotted. This year's conference in Long Beach, California, with 1,500 people attending in person and 500 watching a simulcast at the TEDActive conference in Palm Springs, features Bill Gates, Sheryl Crow, Sarah Silverman, James Cameron, David Byrne and Eve Ensler, among a roster of speakers in fields such as technology, science, philosophy, art, music and design. Anderson, who built and eventually sold a magazine publishing empire in the 1980s and 1990s, first attended a TED conference in 1998 and was intrigued that many people said it was the highlight of their year. He acquired TED in 2001 and hosted his first conference in 2003. Three years later, TED began posting videos of its talks on the Web. They have been viewed more than 200 million times and many have now been given subtitles in 70 languages, through the work of volunteer translators. With the TED Prize, the organization goes beyond simply spreading ideas. ""Whenever I've been to TED, I've been struck by how towards the end of the conference, you had a room full of influential connected people absolutely burning with the possibility of inspiration, and it felt like something could be done with that,"" Anderson said. After a brainstorming session with participants, the idea of a TED Prize emerged, ""a prize that instead of looking back, it looked forward. You brought someone to the conference and instead of just honoring them, you granted them a wish, a chance to make a difference in the world, a wish without restrictions."" Amy Novogratz, director of the TED Prize, said the year after biologist E.O. Wilson wished for a database to document every species on earth, the organization helped launch the ""Encyclopedia of Life."" ""Bono, the humanitarian rock star, won in 2005,"" Novogratz said, ""and wished for a million Americans to sign up to say that they care about poverty in Africa. With Bono and his organization we launched one.org, and he delivered a petition to the G8 that summer with almost 2 million signatures."" Sylvia Earle, the marine biologist, has led dozens of expeditions, including an all-female team that lived for weeks underwater in 1970. She also walked on the sea floor untethered at a lower depth than any other woman. In her talk last year, she pointed out that in the past 50 years, 90 percent of the big fish in the oceans have been consumed and nearly half of the ocean's coral reefs have disappeared. Less than one percent of the ocean is protected from destructive fishing, and Earle believes the seas will go into irreversible decline unless a much larger portion - some experts say as much as 30 percent - is protected. Earle said the world needs to act swiftly to protect what she calls ""the blue heart of the planet that basically keeps us alive."" She told CNN in an interview that a major public awareness campaign will be launched this year and that plans are underway for a conference at sea to get ""influential people to use their talents and intellect to come up with new ways to address these problems."" Earle attributes these initiatives to the involvement of TED. ""It allows us to tap into individuals and organizations all over the world that I wouldn't be able to do as an individual,"" she said. ""They create this awareness and they frame the issues in such a way that people get it and they're inspired to help. And that is a true gift. That's the real prize.""",0.5657407,9295
147,"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- A team of experts gathered Friday on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula to decide how to deal with marauding bears that reportedly have killed two people recently. As many as 12,000 bears live on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The bears are blamed for the deaths of two guards at a geological station near a platinum mine on the peninsula in far eastern Russia. Russian media reports cite local law enforcement officials as saying the remains of the two men had been ""gnawed on."" Groups of bears have been reported in the region since the deaths, and many people have refused to work at the mine, saying they are afraid. Three hunters and a representative of Koryakgeoldobycha, employer of around 400 people at the mine, will evaluate the danger and decide whether killing a few animals is necessary, said Vladimir Rudeyev of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry in Kamchatka. ""All decisions are made locally,"" he told CNN. ""No licenses [for shooting bears] have been issued yet. Reports came out that they were, but that's incorrect."" Hunters might need to kill only the most aggressive bears, he said. Generally, bears are timid animals and need only to be scared off. Exterminating wild bears that are not afraid of humans is relatively common in Canada and the United States. Trouble in northeastern Kamchatka began when the two unarmed geological station guards were found dead July 17. More than 93 miles (150 kilometers) away, about 20 bears came into another station several days later. Then, dozens more wild bears were seen 25 to 50 miles (40 to 80 kilometers) away, around various stations and villages in the area. ""Bears came out to where they used to live before,"" Rudeyev said. ""It constantly happens on the Kamchatka Peninsula, on various rivers, places where people work."" Humans are to blame because they attract the animals by leaving out trash or they frighten bear cubs, turning them into aggressive grown-ups, he said. Laura Williams, senior adviser for the World Wildlife Fund in Russia, also said it's the search for food that probably drives bears close to human camps. Kamchatka bears are used to feeding on salmon in the summer, but there have been fewer of the fish in local rivers this year because of overfishing, contamination or natural causes. ""When [bears] don't have salmon, they go into some of the settlements, creating bad situations both for themselves and people,"" Williams said.

148,"MATURA, Trinidad (CNN) -- With its white sand and clear, blue water, Trinidad's Matura Beach looks like a postcard. It's a far cry from its recent past, when leatherback sea turtle carcasses littered the ground and kept tourists away. Suzan Lakhan Baptiste's efforts have turned a beach from a leatherback turtle graveyard to a nesting colony. ""Twenty years ago, this was a graveyard,"" Suzan Lakhan Baptiste said of the six-mile stretch of beach near her home. ""The stench was horrendous. You could smell it for miles,"" she said. Saddened and frustrated, Baptiste launched a crusade to help end the slaughter of the gentle giants. Today, she and her group are succeeding: What was once a turtle graveyard is now a maternity ward -- one of the largest leatherback nesting colonies in the world. It hasn't been an easy fight for Baptiste or the turtles. For 100 million years, the creatures have traveled the world's oceans, outliving the dinosaurs. Over the last 30 years, they have become critically endangered worldwide because of fishing, pollution and hunting. For centuries, they've been hunted throughout the Caribbean for their meat and fins, and also for their eggs, which some people prize as aphrodisiacs. ""Turtles are in serious trouble,"" Baptiste said. Every year, female leatherbacks make their way onto the beach, laying their eggs deep in the sand. It is a long, complicated ritual during which the enormous, slow-moving animals are easy prey for poachers. ""Leatherbacks [are] very vulnerable,"" Baptiste said. ""They cannot pull their head and flippers back into the shell. They have no sense of defense to actually protect themselves."" By the 1980s, nearly one in three turtles that nested on Matura Beach were killed. When the government asked for volunteers to help protect the endangered creatures, Baptiste and several others answered the call. In 1990, they started Nature Seekers, one of Trinidad's first environmental groups. 'Crazy Turtle Woman' For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season. She often walked alone until sunrise. Locals mocked her efforts, calling her the ""Turtle Police"" or ""Crazy Turtle Woman,"" yet her dedication to the unpaid work was fierce; when it conflicted with her day job, she quit and found a new job. Leatherbacks were a vital source of income for some members of her village, and the poachers who prowled the beaches with machetes could be threatening. When Baptiste's then-husband was injured during a patrol, she became more determined to stand her ground. ""I was very vigilant,"" she said, adding that at times, she even got into physical fights. But Baptiste persisted, and a prestigious award from the United Nations Environment Program helped validate her efforts. She and her group also worked hard to convince the villagers that using the turtles for eco-tourism could create a more sustainable income. ""I wanted to show that a turtle is [worth] so much more to us alive than dead,"" Baptiste said. Gradually, her message of conservation turned the tide of public opinion, and after nearly two decades under Baptiste's leadership, Nature Seekers has largely won its battle. Today, the leatherbacks' survival rate on Matura Beach is virtually 100 percent. ""Here, turtle slaughter is a thing of the past,"" Baptiste proclaimed. Even ""Papa George,"" a village elder who used to hunt leatherbacks with his father, can attest to the cultural shift. ""Suzan brought around the change,"" he said. ""They don't kill the turtles anymore ... because of the visitors."" Nearly 10,000 tourists a year, most of whom are Trinidadian, now visit Matura Beach, and many locals make a living by providing them with accommodations, food and souvenirs. Since the beach is a prohibited area during the nesting season, Nature Seekers' members act as guides, explaining the turtles' ancient rituals to visitors. In addition, Baptiste and her colleagues gather data on the enormous creatures, tagging and weighing as many leatherbacks as they can.  Watch Baptiste and her group weigh a leatherback turtle at night » . During peak season, they might see between 250 or 300 turtles a night. More than 5,000 leatherbacks nest in the area each year. The group's work is often cited as one of the most successful eco-tourism efforts in the Caribbean. Still, turtle slaughter persists throughout the region, and Baptiste is working to help other groups learn from her success, most recently on the island of Dominica. She finds joy in sharing her hard-earned knowledge. ""The passion that I feel, it burns me up,"" she said. ""I have seen the fruits of our labor, and it can happen in every community.""  Watch how Baptiste helped end the slaughter of turtles in her community » . Her efforts -- and those of many others around the region -- are making a difference. While leatherbacks are still critically endangered worldwide, the Caribbean population has begun to rebound. ""When I got started, a lot of people thought I was crazy,"" Baptiste said, and she admits that she sometimes wondered if they were right. Reflecting on what she and her team have accomplished, she now believes it was worth it. ""I love being crazy, you know?"" she said, laughing. ""Crazy with a passion, crazy with a dream -- totally environmentally crazy."" Want to get involved? Check out Nature Seekers and see how to help.",0.5627379,5342
149,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The days are getting shorter, the nights colder, but that doesn't mean that your electricity bill needs to go through the roof. In a unique experiment, the residents of Britain's Scilly Isles are hoping to show that reducing your electricity consumption doesn't have to be difficult. The Isles of Scilly is switching off power to promote energy efficiency. As part of E-Day, homes, schools and businesses on the Scilly Isles are switching off all non-essential electrical equipment to promote energy saving. The results of the experiment are being posted online in real-time. E-Day organizer, Matt Prescott said: ""The Isles of Scilly are like a miner's canary for the rest of the UK, because of their vulnerability to sea level rise, to violent storms rolling off the Atlantic and to any major changes in the Gulf Stream."" The islands, which lie 28 miles off Land's End, the UK's most westerly point, are connected to the UK mainland by a single electricity cable which means that power usage in the experiment can be measured efficiently. All of the 2000-strong community who are spread across five islands have been encouraged to join in. The energy savings made will be compared against the previous day's usage with updates appearing online regularly. The E-Day Web site keeps track of costs and kWh usage providing up-to-the-minute information about how much electricity is being used in island-wide as well as individually monitoring Five Islands School on St Mary's Island and the electricity consumption of one family. ""We've fitted the family and the school with special energy monitors so they can accurately monitor what appliances use the most electricity,"" Prescott told CNN. Studies suggest that families who use these sorts of energy monitors can cut their electricity bills by up to 20 percent. At the time of writing, the family's consumption had dropped dramatically, down 35 percent on the previous day, which Prescott estimates is a saving of around £300 ($475) on their annual electricity bill. Sadly the figures for the school and the island as a whole weren't quite so impressive. The school was up six percent on the previous day, while the island as a whole saw a two percent rise in usage. Prescott put these small rises down to the notoriously fickle British weather. ""Yesterday was lovely and sunny,"" he said. ""So far, today it has been rainy."" The damp and gloom have meant more lights being switched on but despite these meteorological setbacks, Prescott remained upbeat about the success of the experiment. ""Before the family left home this morning they turned off everything they could, so their reduction in usage is a fantastic result,"" he said. Visitors to the the E-Day Web site can also play the""5 Things"" game to find out what all sorts of household appliances cost to run and how much they cost you and the environment. ""The E-Day experiment will hopefully prove that the small things can make a big difference, especially when we work together and try to save energy,"" Prescott said. Prescott is also the founder of ""Ban the Bulb"" -- an energy efficiency campaign which is helping phase out the use of incandescent light bulbs in 30 countries. The event has been organized as part of a four-day Earth Summit event which has seen the Isles of Scilly play host to fellow islanders from Samoa, The Galapagos Islands, Madagascar and the Carteret Islands -- whose inhabitants are some of the first people being displaced by rising sea-levels.",0.56193817,7778
150,"(CNN) -- Undercover officers rescued a baby gorilla from suspected animal traffickers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a national park in the country announced Tuesday. This baby gorilla was rescued from a suspected trafficker in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The gorilla, thought to be about two years old, was hidden at the bottom of a bag and covered with clothes when Congolese Wildlife Authority officers arrested the suspected trafficker on Sunday, Virunga National Park said. The gorilla, a female, was overheated and dehydrated after six hours in transit. She also had a puncture wound on her right leg, among other injuries, and is malnourished, but is responding to treatment, the park said in a statement. It is not clear if the young gorilla's mother is alive or dead, park spokeswoman Samantha Newport said. ""You can assume that a gorilla family was attacked in order for the traffickers to obtain a baby -- but it is impossible to know if a whole family was wiped out, just a few individuals, or none at all,"" she said. ""In most cases gorillas have to die to get a baby -- but we cannot know specifically for this case."" The animal is now being looked after by specially trained carers, Newport said. ""This is of course not an ideal replacement for a mother -- but the best option we have,"" she told CNN via e-mail. Carers often have some veterinary training, but are not fully fledged vets, she added. But gorillas do not do well in situations like this, she warned. ""Gorillas, it is worth noting, are notoriously difficult to keep alive,"" she said. ""Chimps are fighters, as are bonobos. But gorillas -- when the going gets tough -- tend to just shut down. So it really is a critical time right now to ensure she gets the veterinary attention and human warmth that she needs to get through this."" The suspect was getting off a plane from the interior of the country, near the gorillas' habitat, the park said. One person has been charged under the country's law forbidding the destruction of flora and fauna, Newport told CNN. The park did not name the suspect. Gorillas can fetch up to $20,000 on the black market, the head of Virunga National Park said. ""Investigations have yet to reveal where these animals are being sent and who is buying them, but on the ground sources tell us that a baby gorilla can fetch up to $20,000,"" said Emmanuel de Merode, the director. ""We must remember that for each trafficked baby gorilla, several gorillas have probably been killed in the wild."" He led the three-month undercover operation that netted the suspect and the gorilla, the park said. The gorilla is a lowland eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), also known as the Grauer's Gorilla, a subspecies of Eastern Gorilla only found in the forests of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the park. Virunga National Park calls itself the oldest national park in Africa, established in 1925. It lies in a region that has been badly affected by the long-running war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The gorilla section is in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. A ranger was killed earlier this year, and rangers lost control of a large part of the park to rebels for over a year. But a census earlier this year suggests mountain gorillas are surviving despite poaching and war. Officials have long said that the 250-square kilometer gorilla reserve in the southern part of Virunga National Park is where around 200 of the world's 700 mountain gorillas live.",0.56106657,5706
151,"BOULDER, Colorado (CNN) -- Blake Jones' business plan for his company, Namaste Solar Electric, was so unusual, he confounded a lot of business experts. Typical home solar systems cost about $12,000 up front, but supporters say they pay off in the long run. ""We did have a lot of skeptical, raised eyebrows at the beginning,"" Jones said of his company, which installs solar power systems in Colorado. ""We even have had business schools bring teams of MBA students to come to do a case study,"" he said. Outsiders were baffled by some of these company plans: . • Environmental concerns would be a driving force in every aspect of the company. • Six weeks of paid time off. • A concept called FOH -- frank, open and honest -- to help eliminate gossip and grudges. • Employees, no matter what their job description, have the same pay scale. • One percent of yearly revenues goes to solar systems donated to community groups. • All major decisions would be made by consensus of all company employees. Jones had done a serious turnabout in his own career that inspired some of the unusual principles of Namaste. Namaste is a Sanskrit greeting meaning ""to bow to you."" The civil engineer spent five years working in the Middle East for Brown and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, in the oil and gas industry. ""But something in me realized there is something more. I didn't like the overdependence that we have on oil and gas. I think oil and gas, even coal are always going to be a very big part of our lives. But I think what we need to do, is we need a more balanced portfolio. I had a gradual awakening to wanting passionately to work with renewable energy because I thought there was a better way,"" Jones said. He moved from the Middle East to Nepal, where he spent three years installing solar and hydroelectric systems in remote areas. Although the clients and the mission are very different in Colorado, solar power is becoming a more popular long-term investment in the state. Jones picked a place where residents are open to doing things a different way. Boulder is tree-hugger heaven by anyone's standards. The city has lots of incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. ""There is more interest in solar in Boulder then anywhere else in Colorado. That's one example of how environmentally focused our community is,"" said Sarah Vanpelt, environmental sustainability coordinator for the city. In 2004, Colorado voters approved state incentives for the use of alternative energy. ""And Boulder provides a rebate on a portion of the sales and use tax that property owners pay to purchase and install a system, and we use those funds to provide grants to nonprofits to install solar on affordable housing, low-income housing, and on nonprofit facilities,"" Vanpelt said. ""So I think we will continue to see growth in the green industry and in renewable energy, both solar and wind,"" she said. Namaste is in the process of remodeling a 15,000-square-foot warehouse for its offices.  Watch more about the unique project » . And it is doing it to the highest of green building standards, the LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification. That involves everything from the use of natural light to the recycling of building materials to the access to the building by public transportation. And yes, all the building's electricity will be provided by a solar system Namaste installs. Most of the panels will be on the roof, but there will also be a solar awning. Construction manager Marc Smerekanicz did some of his own head-scratching with some of the requests to meet LEED standards. ""Thinking in a different way than what I was brought up to think of as the construction process, that's the way of the future,"" Smerekanicz said. For some customers, it is rising energy prices as much as concern for the environment that is prompting them to consider solar power for their homes and businesses. Namaste just installed solar panels on the home of Hal Stuber. ""It's become more reasonably priced, and on top of that there are the incentives from the utility company, also the federal tax credits. So, all in all, the economics really look excellent,"" Stuber said. ""For every $3 of cost, from rebates and tax credits I'm getting about $2 back, and yeah, that's a big incentive. I doubt that I would have done this had it not been for the rebates and tax incentives,"" he said. Stuber plans to use some of his solar power for a plug-in motorbike. And when his system produces more power than he uses, his electric meter runs backward. At the end of the year, he may get money back from the utility. Even with rebates, Jones said, a typical solar system costs a homeowner about $12,000 up front. But he said that as a long-term investment, it pays off. He said that's why the company's community involvement comes in the form of solar installations, not cash. ""We consider a solar system to be a gift that keeps on giving. If we give them a solar system, then it will save their electricity bills each year for the next 30 years, compared to if we just give them money, it will contribute to their budget for that one year only,"" Jones said. So how's that crazy business plan working? In the past 3½ years, Namaste has installed more solar systems than any other company in Colorado. Three original employees have grown to 45. And the company has been growing by triple-digit percentages every year. ""Whatever perspective you look at, we're being profitable, and it's exactly what we need to do to prove that our business experiment, that our company model is going to work,"" Jones said.",0.55918825,2123

153,"(CNN) -- Just west of Seville in Spain, a sea of giant mirrors is reflecting the sun's energy to provide ""concentrated solar power"" (CSP) while illuminating the path to a new wave of green energy projects. Shining beacon: The concentrated solar power plant in Sanlucar, Spain is the first of its kind. The 624 carefully positioned mirrors reflect the sun's heat towards a 50 meter-tall central tower where it is concentrated and used to boil water into steam. The superheated steam is then used to turn a turbine that can produce up to 11 megawatts of electricity -- enough power for 6,000 homes -- according Solucar, the Spanish company that has built the power plant. While traditional solar panels, photovoltaic cells, convert the sun's power directly into electricity, CSP focuses power from a wide area and uses the vast heat generated to make electricity in a similar way to that produced from coal or oil. The Spanish tower, known as PS10, is the first phase of an ambitious development. By 2013 it is hoped that additional towers will create a ""solar farm"" with an output of 300 megawatts, which would be enough power for 180,000 homes, or equivalent to the entire population of nearby Seville. This $1.5 billion project is the largest commercial CSP station in the world -- so far. But many believe the technology will soon take off in areas of continuous hot sun and clear skies, offering a cheaper and more efficient alternative to photovoltaic cells, and bringing jobs and money to arid, often depressed areas. CSP also produces no greenhouses gasses and the only pollution is visual. The European Union has invested over $31 million in CSP research over the last ten years. At least 50 CSP projects have been given permission to begin construction across Spain. By 2015 the country may be producing two gigawatts of electricity from CSP, and employing thousands in the industry. One of the strengths of CSP is that it allows the construction of power stations on a scale that can match many fossil fuel based plants, and for an investment far less than that required to install the equivalent wattage of photovoltaic cells. There is also the possibility that production can keep going around the clock -- even when the sun has gone down. Solucar is currently testing technology at a plant near Granada that will pump 50 percent of the electricity generated in the day into the Spanish national grid, and use the other 50 percent to melt salt, which will then act as a kind of battery, storing the sun's power. When dusk falls, the heat stored in the molten salt can be used to generate power through the night. ""These technologies excite me,"" says Dr Jeff Hardy, Network Manager at the UK Energy Research Council. ""One of the real advantages is that you can get a decent sized power plant. ""The main challenge with the technology is working with extreme heat, but then a lot of the back-end is very similar to a traditional fossil-fuel generation; you are after all just dealing with water heated to make steam and drive a turbine."" Concentrating on promoting CSP worldwide . As America looks to increase the contribution of renewables to its overall energy mix -- a key part of the Obama plan before the recession turbocharged Government funding for such ""green"" infrastructure projects -- the potential of CSP technology is obvious. The Spanish company responsible for the Sanlucar la Mayor plant has seen the potential and created Solucar Power, Inc., a subsidiary aiming to develop the market in the USA. There is already a huge Solar Energy Generating Systems' CSP station in the Mojave Desert, California; Spanish firm Acciona has built a plant near Las Vegas. Many more are surely on their way. One bold projection estimates that a single plant 100 miles by 100 miles located in the American South West could generate enough electricity for the whole country. It would obviously be a huge undertaking -- politically, financially and scientifically -- but it's not hard to imagine such a scheme finding a home in the nation's vast, empty quarter. Other equally arid areas may also find themselves transformed, and CSP may be able to offer valuable foreign earnings for drought-stricken Africa -- while giving Europe the green energy it needs. According to Dr Hardy the technology has a ready application, given the right political, environmental and economic context. ""Concentrated Solar Power is proven to do well in countries like Spain with a favorable government policies and the right climate,"" he says. ""I can certainly see the potential for extended networks linking together, and the idea of a North African grid linking renewable resources is a real possibility."" Providing power, jobs and money . The Sahara, the world's largest desert, is fringed by some of the poorest countries in the world and the harsh environment has always been seen as a problem, with it's vast, waterless interior regularly reaching temperatures of over 45 degrees Celsius. But with large-scale CSP projects, suddenly all that empty space, with its year-round clear skies and hot sun, has a value that could transform local economies. It could potentially turn Africa into a net exporter of energy to power-hungry Europe, and perhaps even do for countries in North Africa what oil did for Saudi Arabia. The sums are dizzying. Estimates vary, but one projection from the German Aerospace Agency puts the amount of solar energy stored in just one per cent of the Sahara -- 35,000 square miles, or a piece of land slightly smaller than Portugal -- as having the potential to yield more power than all the world's existing power plants combined. Already Spanish firms are exporting CSP technology to Morocco and Algeria, and a British consortium, the Sahara Forest Project, is testing the technology in the deserts of Oman. Costs and benefits . However, there is a problem: at the moment costs are still very high. But they are falling as plants get bigger, the technology is perfected and economies of scale kick in. Even so, any plans to power Europe from the Sahara would require a vast infrastructure of CSP plants and cables laid across the Mediterranean -- requiring billions upon billions of dollars in investment. Such sums will only be possible through international co-operation on a huge scale. But on a smaller, more local scale a simple change in the way electricity generators are paid has been hugely effective in boosting renewable power. In Spain and other European countries investment has been encouraged by Governments creating what's known as a ""feed in tariff,"" which pays companies a premium for power sold to the national grid generated by renewable means for a fixed period of time. This enables investors to pay back up front costs more quickly. Where they have been introduced they have brought about a huge increase in renewable power: Germany has 200 times as much solar energy as Britain, generates 12 percent of its electricity from renewables, and has created a quarter of a million jobs in the sector. We're a long way from a future where the Sahara becomes the world's largest source of renewable electricity, and the American South West is covered in mirrors lighting and powering cities across the continent. There are many huge issues yet to resolve, but with small steps, we may be moving towards it.",0.5583141,1826
155,"(CNN) -- A global commodities trading company says it is considering a settlement to legal claims that it is responsible for the deaths of 15 people and thousands of illnesses after 500 tons of toxic waste were dumped in the African nation of Ivory Coast. Signs such as this were still up in ""toxic zones"" around Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a year after the waste dumping. The Dutch company Trafigura said studies by 20 experts it has hired conclude that the chemicals did not harm anyone. ""In view of that expert evidence, and the fact that claims are not being made in this litigation for deaths, miscarriages, still births, birth defects and other serious injuries, the parties are exploring the possibility of compromising the claims which have been made,"" Trafigura said in a release Wednesday. ""A global settlement is being considered by the parties and it currently appears that this settlement is likely to be acceptable to most, if not all, of the claimants."" A United Nations report also released Wednesday said Trafigura did cause death and injury when the cargo ship Probo Koala dumped 500 tons of toxic waste belonging to the company at sites around Abidjan, the West African nation's largest city. The incident happened in August 2006. ""According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 people were hospitalized and over 100,000 others, complaining of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes, sought medical treatment after the incident,"" said the report by Okechukwu Ibeanu, an unpaid investigator for the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council. ""We still don't know -- and we may never know -- the full effect of the dumping. But there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste."" Ibeanu, who visited Ivory Coast and the Netherlands during his investigation, urged all parties to take steps ""to address possible long-term human health and environmental effects of the incident."" According to a U.N. statement, Ibeanu said last month that the areas where the toxic waste was dumped still have not been decontaminated and continue to threaten residents' health. Many people, he said, are still reporting headaches, skin lesions, digestive difficulties and nose, throat and lung problems. Trafigura noted in its release Wednesday that it initiated a plan two years ago that would compensate, without any admission of liability, any claimants who could demonstrate any injury caused by exposure to the waste, which the company calls ""slops."" ""The company has always maintained that the Probo Koala's slops could not possibly have caused deaths and serious or long-term injuries,"" Trafigura said. ""Independent expert witnesses firmly support Trafigura in this stance."" Trafigura also maintains it ""sought to comply with all relevant regulations and procedures concerning the offloading of the Probo Koala's slops in Abidjan."" The company denies that the ship went to Ivory Coast solely to dump the toxic waste. ""Trafigura has consistently stated that the Probo Koala was returning from a routine commercial voyage to deliver a gasoline cargo in Lagos, Nigeria, when it stopped in Abidjan,"" the company statement said. ""Consequently, any suggestion that the vessel was sent to West Africa solely for the purpose of offloading its slops is entirely inaccurate.""

157,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Researchers in the United States are buoyed by the results of a study which has determined that a giant grass could help the country to meet its steep biofuel targets. Stephen Long amid Miscanthus stalks found to outperform other biofuel sources. After successful long-term trials in Europe, a three-year field study of Miscanthus x giganteus by the University of Illinois has revealed that it outperforms traditional biofuel sources, producing more than twice the ethanol per acre than corn or switchgrass, using a quarter of the space. Crop sciences professor and study leader Dr. Stephen Long told CNN that while there probably isn't one magic bullet to fix our climate woes, Miscanthus -- also known as elephant grass -- promises to be one of five or six options that could help the U.S. to reach its target of replacing 30 percent of gasoline use with biofuels by 2030. ""I think it's important in the biofuels debate that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water. The idea we use the sun's energy to grow plants and then make fuels from those plants is essentially a good one,"" Dr. Long said. ""It's been tainted by the fact that the easy way to do it is to just use food crops, but society needs to realize there are big opportunities beyond food crops and beyond the use of crop land."" Miscanthus, for instance, is able to grow on land too marginal for crop production, so it doesn't have to compete with land for food crops. It also doesn't require major input or fertilization after planting and once established will yield for around 15 years. Yet even with the success of these trials in the U.S. and the earlier European ones, it could be years before the full potential of Miscanthus is realized. This is due in part to the fact that it's much more complex to make cellulosic ethanol -- ethanol made from non-food plants -- than it is to turn simple food starches found in corn or wheat into ethanol. In the United Kingdom, Miscanthus is recognized by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as an energy crop and it's currently being used to co-fire the Drax power station in England's Yorkshire. Even still, Dr. Geraint Evans from the UK's National Non-Food Crops Centre said rather than plants like Miscanthus, wheat grain will be used to meet the UK target of replacing five percent of fuel with renewable sources by 2010. ""Miscanthus has the potential to be more efficient, producing between 4,000 and 7,000 liters of fuel per hectare, whereas ethanol made from wheat grain makes about 1900 liters per hectare."" ""Wheat grain-derived ethanol is what we can do today with the technology we have available today. The technology to use Miscanthus is not yet commercially available,"" Dr. Evans told CNN. In addition to the technical hitch, Dr. Evans said a further downside is that even though Miscanthus is a low maintenance crop, it can be costly to plant compared to wheat or rapeseed canola and the first yield wouldn't occur for at least three years. In an effort to overcome some of the challenges, Dr. Long now intends to turn his attention to experimenting with the wild Miscanthus used in the U.S. trial. And if the sort of improvements made to corn in the last 50 years are any indication, Miscanthus could be well be used to fuel the future in a matter of years. Is Miscanthus the next big thing in biofuels? Sound off below.",0.5569789,5320

NEW YORK (CNN) --   In a recent CNN commentary entitled ""Green jobs: hope or hype?"" Samuel Sherraden argues that green job creation will be insufficient to bring America out of recession. But Sherraden narrowly defines green as a ""sector,"" and fails to see its potential as a strategy for the revitalization of the entire economy. When the public debate is focused around the precise number of green jobs created in, say, a solar panel factory, we miss the opportunity as a country to think more broadly about greening the economy -- and building a foundation for real growth and competitiveness. The aspiration to create ""green jobs"" should really be seen as shorthand for two public priorities -- immediate job creation and long-term transformation of the economy for sustainability and prosperity -- and both goals can be addressed simultaneously. However, in judging our progress, a simple tally of jobs in ""green sectors"" is only a partial indicator of the impact and thus can be misleading. A lot depends here on definitions. For example, Sherraden cites a 2008 report produced by Global Insight on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which identifies a little more than 750,000 green jobs in the United States today. A report in the same year, from the American Solar Energy Society, counts more than 9 million green jobs in the United States. This is not to say that one report is better than the other, but to point out that much difference -- in this case, more than 8 million jobs -- depends on how you count. The critical point Sherraden misses is that it's not just job creation in new green industries that matter, but also new jobs in traditional industries -- or the retooling of old jobs -- to make those industries greener. A great example is the real estate industry. Energy efficiency retrofits of buildings and homes have the potential to yield significant savings in energy costs while creating work for building engineers, electricians, contractors, manufacturers and people in a whole host of other industries that would not typically be considered ""green."" By comparison, 10 or 15 years ago anyone who used a computer was considered to have a ""tech job,"" but now nearly everyone uses a computer (and a cell phone and a PDA) and yet we don't call all jobs ""tech jobs."" We talk about how technology has changed every industry and profession. Moreover, even investments in sectors we recognize as green can have other positive economic impacts. Investing in wind power, for example, creates jobs in wind turbine manufacturing plants as well as jobs in the industries that supply the plant with parts, jobs producing the materials that make up these parts, jobs producing the electricity used in the plant, and so on. There is solid evidence that investment in green economic activity will result in more jobs than many other comparable investments because a greater proportion of funds would go toward labor and would remain in the United States. The Center for American Progress and the Political Economy Research Institute examined the impact of comparable investments in the oil and gas industry, tax refunds to stimulate household spending, and six specific energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies. They concluded that $100 billion of investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency would create approximately 2 million jobs, compared to 1.7 million jobs from stimulating household spending and about half a million jobs from investment in oil and gas. By investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency as strategies for our economy, we will create jobs in the United States, not just green jobs. More importantly, we lay the groundwork for American economic competitiveness and moral leadership in a carbon-constrained world. If we fail to support environmental innovation through investment and public policy, the United States will find itself at a disadvantage relative to other nations. America is at a crossroads. If we see green as an engine of growth, there is an unprecedented opportunity to create jobs and revitalize the economy through smart, wide-ranging investments supported by changes in public policy. In the debate over green job creation, we must not lose sight of the larger objective -- the creation of an economy that is more sustainable, in terms of employment, competitiveness and impact on the natural world. What we need to be asking is: How can we make every industry a green industry and every job a green job? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew L. Shapiro.",0.554785,6215
159,"SAN MIGUEL DEL MONTE, Argentina (CNN) -- In a small farming town 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires, farmers are struggling to nourish their crops and feed their animals. The worst drought in half a century has turned Argentina's once-fertile soil to dust and pushed the country into a state of emergency. Argentine farmers profited in years past from selling beef to the world, but some now struggle to feed their cattle. Cow carcasses litter the prairie fields and sun-scorched soy plants wither under the South American summer sun. Farmers are concerned about their livelihoods. ""I'm losing money. I can't afford to lose money all the time,"" said Juan Cahen D'Anvers, whose family has been farming in Argentina since the late 1700s. He owns 700 hectares (1,730 acres) in San Miguel del Monte, where he grows sunflowers and barley. He says this year is one of the hardest he's ever had.  Watch farmer explain how hard he's been hit » . ""Production is going to go down a minimum of 50 percent, maybe more. I don't know yet,"" he said. Argentina is one of the world's breadbaskets, providing commodities such as soy, wheat, corn and beef to countries around the globe. In recent years, record-high prices for these products reaped millions of dollars for Argentine farmers, but since the global economic crisis hit, demand and profits have dropped. Now the drought is making matters even worse. Cesar Gioia, another San Miguel del Monte farmer, said time is growing short. ""If it doesn't rain in the next 10 days, I will have to wipe out my entire corn crop, 90 hectares (220 acres),"" he said. ""The best I can do with it is feed it to my cows."" Facing pressure from farmers, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced emergency measures this week that will exempt the worst-hit farmers from paying most taxes for one year. ""This is a big boost of patriotism, and a sign of support from all Argentines,"" Kirchner said on January 26. ""All other sectors of the economy will continue to contribute, so we can help the farmers who have been affected by this drought."" Kirchner has had a contentious relationship with farmers, who staged noisy protests and strikes last year over an increase in export taxes. Those taxes eventually were reduced, but farming leaders still contend that the government is out of touch with their needs. They say the measures announced this week fall short, and are demanding a cohesive, long-term plan for dealing with emergencies such as the current drought. If not, they say, they may strike again.  Watch how farmers reacted to Kirchner's move » . ""Sure, this plan is approved now, and it helps, but we need money to feed cows, to go back to planting crops, because this drought is impacting life in every sector of society,"" said Eduardo Buzzi of the Argentine Agrarian Federation. As she yanks dead soy plant vines from a dusty field in San Miguel del Monte, Lorena del Rios of the Argentina Rural Society says she expects the drought to affect both Argentine and overseas consumers, especially when it comes to Argentina's world-famous beef. ""We will see less meat available, which means rising prices,"" she said. ""There is even the possibility that in a few years Argentina will have to import beef, which is almost unthinkable for people here.""",0.5528975,3334
160,"(CNN) -- An Indonesian fisherman has been killed by Komodo dragons after he was attacked while trespassing on a remote island in search of fruit, officials said Tuesday. Komodo dragons kill their prey with an extremely toxic bite. Muhamad Anwar, 32, bled to death on his way to hospital after being mauled by the reptiles at Loh Sriaya, in eastern Indonesia's Komodo National Park, the park's general manager Fransiskus Harum told CNN. ""The fisherman was inside the park when he went looking for sugar-apples. The area was forbidden for people to enter as there are a lot of wild dragons,"" Harum said. Other fisherman took Anwar to a clinic on nearby Flores Island, east of Bali, but he was declared dead on arrival, he added. Komodo dragons, the world's heaviest lizards, can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length and have a toxic bite that they use to kill prey such as buffalo, returning to feast when the animal succumbs to the poison. Despite their ungainly appearance, the carnivorous reptiles can run as fast as a dog in short bursts, jump up on their hind legs, and kill animals with a blow of their powerful tails. Attacks on humans are rare, but Monday's incident is the latest in a series in which the monster lizards -- which have forked tongues and fearsome claws --have killed or injured people. Last month a park ranger survived after a Komodo dragon climbed the ladder into his hut and savaged his hand and foot. In 2007 an eight-year-old boy died after being mauled. In June last year, a group of divers who were stranded on an island in the national park -- the dragons' only natural habitat -- had to fend off several attacks from the reptiles before they were rescued. Park rangers also tell the cautionary tale of a Swiss tourist who vanished leaving nothing but a pair of spectacles and a camera after an encounter with the dragons several years ago. An endangered species, Komodo are believed to number less than 4,000 in the wild. Access to their habitat is restricted, but tourists can get permits to see them in the wild within the National Park. All visitors are accompanied by rangers, about 70 of whom are deployed across the park's 60,000 hectares of vegetation and 120,000 hectares of ocean. Despite a threat of poachers, Komodo dragon numbers are believed to have stabilized in recent years, bolstered by successful breeding campaigns in captivity. On Monday, a zoo in Surabaya on the Indonesian island of Java reported the arrival of 32 newborn Komodos after the babies all hatched in the past two weeks, the Jakarta Post reported.",0.5492771,2079
161,"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (CNN) -- If you listen to inventor Dean Kamen, the biggest health problem facing the world today is not AIDS, obesity or malnutrition. It's a shortage of water. Dean Kamen hopes to tackle the world's fresh water shortage with the Slingshot, a water purifying device. Water is the most abundant resource on the planet, yet less than one percent of the Earth's freshwater supply is readily available to drink, according to the World Health Organization. Lack of accessible or clean drinking water, exacerbated by drought, is crippling communities in many developing countries. ""In your lifetime, my lifetime, we will see water be a really scarce, valuable commodity,"" Kamen says. Those are scary words from the man whose creations include the Segway personal motorized scooter and the Luke (as in Skywalker) prosthetic arm. But the forward-thinking inventor and his team at DEKA Research in Manchester, New Hampshire, aren't sitting around waiting for the world's wells to dry up. They've been working on an invention they say can tap into 97 percent of the world's undrinkable water. It's called the Slingshot, and it's a portable, low energy machine that is designed to purify water in remote villages where there's not a Wal-Mart in sight. The device takes its name from a well-known story. ""We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its Goliath of a problem in water,"" Kamen says. ""So we decided to build a small machine and give it to the little Davids."" Perhaps you've heard about the Slingshot, which Kamen has been working on for more than 10 years. Over that time it has turned dirty river water, ocean water and even raw sewage into pure drinking water. Kamen says it can turn anything that looks wet, or has water in it, into the ""stuff of life."" The magic behind the Slingshot is a ""vapor compression distiller"" that stands between what looks like two empty fish tanks connected by a couple of hoses. One tank contains the contaminated liquid, the other is for the newly clean water.  Watch Kamen demonstrate the Slingshot » . The Slingshot boils, distills and vaporizes the polluted source, in turn delivering nothing but clean water to the other side. And it does it all on less electricity than it takes to run a hair dryer. In summer 2006, Kamen delivered two Slingshots to the small community of Lerida in Honduras. They were used for a month and Kamen says everything ran as planned. ""The machine worked very well down there, taking virtually any water that the people from that village brought to us,"" he says. ""All the water that we got from the machine was absolutely pure water."" But there's a problem. Kamen says each Slingshot costs his company several hundred thousand dollars to build. He's looking to partner with companies and organizations to distribute Slingshots around the world, but says a little more engineering work needs to be done in order to lower the production costs. Kamen says the company would like to get the price down to about $2,000 per machine. ""The biggest challenge right now between this being a dream and a reality is getting committed people that really care about the state of the world's health to get involved,"" Kamen says. The world's population is quickly approaching 7 billion, making access to clean water that much more important. According to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, more than 3.5 million people die every year from water-related diseases and almost 900 million don't have access to a safe water supply. Kamen says people in developing regions of the world need the Slingshot as soon as possible. He also thinks the problem with polluted water will spread beyond small villages. He says one Slingshot machine can supply about 250 gallons of water a day, which is enough for 100 people. That's a lot of Davids. ""It is literally like turning lead into gold,"" he says. ""But I believe it's more important, because you can't drink lead or gold.""",0.5479688,6170
162,"(CNN) -- Shark attacks on humans were at the lowest levels in half a decade last year, and a Florida researcher says hard economic times may be to blame. Fewer people in the water means less chance for sharks to attack, ichthyologist George Burgess says. Sharks attacked 59 people in 2008, the lowest number of attacks since 57 in 2003, according to George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, part of the Florida Museum of Natural History on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville. There were 71 attacks in 2007. ""One can't help but think that the downturn in the economy played a part in it,"" Burgess said. Fewer people, especially outside of the United States, have the resources to go to the beach, he said. ""To have a shark attack, you have to have humans and sharks in the water at the same time,"" Burgess said. ""If you have a reduction in the number of people in the water, you're going to have a reduction in the opportunities for people and sharks to get together."" ""We noticed similar declines during the recession that followed the events of 2001, despite the fact that human populations continued to rise,"" the ichthyologist said. Sharks killed four people in 2008, Burgess said: one in California, one in Australia and two in Mexico. Forty-one of the 59 attacks worldwide came in the United States, and 32 of those occurred in Florida. Surfers accounted for 57 percent of shark attacks, swimmers and waders were the targets in 36 percent of the attacks, and divers the rest, he said. Burgess said the U.S. tends to see more attacks because of a large number of surfers, who are a favorite target of sharks. And neither the economy nor the attacks tend to keep American surfers from practicing their sport. ""All they have to do is drive to the beach with the board and get into the water, and the rest is free,"" he said. And while an attack may make them a bit more wary, he said, ""I've yet to find a surfer who says he or she won't go back into the water after a bite or a nip."" When the economy improves, shark attack numbers are likely to go up again, according to Burgess, predicting the number of attacks in the next decade will surpass those of the past 10 years. ""We're putting so many people in the water that humans are dictating the shark attack situation,"" he said.",0.5464282,2793
163,"(CNN) -- The first decade of the 21st century was the warmest ever on Earth according to data released by scientists at NASA. The U.S. space agency's data also revealed that 2009 was the second warmest year since temperature records began in 1880, and only narrowly cooler than 2005, the warmest year ever. 2008 was the coolest year of the decade but this was attributed to a strong La Nina which causes extensive cooling of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) said in a statement: ""There's substantial year-to-year variability of global temperature caused by the tropical El Nino-La Nina cycle. When we average temperature over five or ten years to minimize that variability, we find global warming is continuing unabated.""

164,"HIGHLANDS COUNTY, Florida (CNN) -- At the heart of Florida researchers' high-tech efforts to protect black bears is a rather low-tech tool: day-old doughnuts. A young bear sits next to a pine tree after being snared by one of the traps set by researchers. Researchers use the doughnuts and other stale pastries to bait traps for the bears. Once snared, the bears are tranquilized and then fitted with a GPS collar. Using cell phone technology, every 15 minutes the collar sends a text message that tells researchers where the bear is located. Tracking the bears' movements -- or lack thereof -- is important. Dr. John Cox, head of the South-Central Florida Bear Project, said the bear population, in order to stay healthy, must be able to travel to different locations throughout the state. They need to travel between different bear populations. But that mobility has been decreasing. There was a time, Cox said, when the bears were free to roam the entire state. As development increased, however, the black bear lost much of its habitat. And the habitat that remained has become more fragmented due to development, primarily roads. The result: The bears become more isolated, with inbreeding within that isolated population. ""This population of bears is actually losing genetic diversity,"" Cox said. ""You see that loss of healthy genes in the population over time. ""That is a sign of isolation."" Having the bears wear the GPS collars is ""wonderful because the bears are telling us what habitat we need to protect,"" said Tricia Martin of The Nature Conservancy. As of now, 55 black bears in the area have been fitted with collars.  Watch the researchers at work » . Researchers want to know whether the bears' travels have them crossing a road, an orange grove, or somewhere else in order to get from place to place. Collecting data on the corridors the bears need to travel will help in pinpointing what land should be sought for conservation purposes. But first the bears must be snared -- and that's where the doughnuts come in. ""The doughnuts are a good bait, they can smell and it'll bring them in,"" said Wade Ulrey, one of the researchers with the South-Central Florida Bear Project. Recently a young female bear was found in a snare trap -- lured there by the doughnuts, or perhaps the brownie with whipped cream and a cherry that also had been placed there. Ulrey and fellow University of Kentucky research scientist Joe Guthrie slowly approached the trapped bear. The animal, with a cable around its paw, tried to climb a pine tree to escape.  See photos of a snared bear » . The researchers waited for the bear to calm down, then they injected her with a tranquilizer that was at the end of an 8-foot-long pole. As they waited for the drug to take effect, Ulrey and Guthrie returned to their truck to gather the tools they needed to examine the bear. ""We have a couple of bags of ice here to help keep her cool,"" Ulrey said as he placed the bags under the legs and arms of the unconscious bear. The team scanned the 2½-year-old and realized she already had a microchip implanted under her skin. ""It's similar to an ID system used for pets,"" said Ulrey. The chip tells the researchers that this bear was caught in 2007, when she was a cub still roaming Florida with her mother. The researchers weighed and measured the bear. Then Ulrey used tweezers to pull out a bit of hair. ""We can get a DNA sample from this to see if she is related to any other bears we've captured in the area,"" Ulrey said. This young black bear, however, won't be telling researchers where she will be traveling. She is too young to be outfitted with a GPS collar. Ninety minutes later, the tranquilizer wears off. The bear is awake and appears unharmed. ""Usually the things you'll see is a little bit of an abrasion where they've rubbed some of the fur off, or maybe a cut,"" Cox said when asked about the danger of using a snare trap. As this young cub wanders off, the research team can only hope she finds a road less traveled -- and stays off the highways.",0.5454,6512
165,"(CNN) -- The ozone hole over Antarctica in 2008 is larger in both size and ozone loss than last year, but not as large as in 2006, the European Space Agency said Tuesday. Some chemical processes produce ozone-depleting gases. The hole is a thinning area in the ozone layer over Antarctica and the size of the hole varies every year depending on weather conditions. This year, the size of the thinned area reached about 27 million square kilometers (10.4 million square miles), compared to 25 million square kilometers (9.65 million square miles) in 2007. In 2006, the hole was a record 29 million square kilometers (11.2 million square miles), larger than North America, the ESA said. The ESA announced its results based on information from German and Dutch researchers who analyzed satellite data. Depletion of ozone is caused by extreme cold temperatures at high altitude and the presence of ozone-destroying gases, such as chlorine and bromine, in the atmosphere, the ESA said. Those gases originate from man-made products like chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were phased out under a global agreement two decades ago but continue to linger in the atmosphere. Ozone is a protective atmospheric layer found at an altitude of about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles). It acts as a sunlight filter, shielding life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays that put humans at greater risk of skin cancer and cataracts and harm marine life, the agency said.",0.54472506,4161
166,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Predatory mice are threatening the albatross population on a remote south Atlantic island and have caused the birds' worst nesting season on record, a British bird charity says. Baby albatross on a remote Atlantic island are threatened by killer house mice. The research from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicates bad news for the Tristan albatross, whose only home is Gough Island in the middle of the south Atlantic. House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said. The mice are also threatening the native population of bunting, one of the world's largest finches, the RSPB said. ""Without removal of the mice, both the albatross and the bunting that live there are doomed to extinction,"" Grahame Madge, a conservation spokesman for the RSPB, told CNN. The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said. This makes it especially difficult for the albatross population to survive because the birds lay eggs only once every two years -- a very low reproductive rate compared to other birds, Madge said. ""What [the mice] are affecting is the ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population,"" he said. Adult Tristan albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea, a practice in which boats put up numerous 100-meter long fishing lines baited with squid or fish. The albatrosses are attracted to the bait and while some manage to steal it successfully, many more get snagged and drown, Madge said. Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction. Gough Island, a British territory almost midway between Argentina and South Africa, is a place of stunning natural beauty. The island is not inhabited by humans. Gough Island and nearby Inaccessible Island are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said. A later survey revealed only 246 chicks had survived to fledgling. ""We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers,"" said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem. ""However, we now know that the albatrosses have suffered their worst year on record."" The bunting suffer because the mice eat their eggs and chicks, and may also compete with them for food in the winter, Cuthbert said. ""The decline in bunting numbers is alarming,"" said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town, who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s. ""Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice, both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time."" The RSPB has been studying whether it is possible to remove the mice. It said trials so far look promising, but it urged the British government to step up funding for the project. It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species. The RSPB said it had been working with New Zealand conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters. Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world. Albatrosses principally live in the southern Atlantic but some also live in the Pacific, the RSPB says. Albatrosses are among the largest flying birds, weighing up to 25 pounds (22.5 kilograms). One species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet, the RSPB says. The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.",0.5437274,1909
168,"During CNN's ""Going Green: Green Light for Business"" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline. LONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions. Jet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside. The sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue. This is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency. There is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky. Practically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change. The reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues. Aviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating. Punitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development. Meeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake. We identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet. The 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing. Aircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of ""over flights"" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum. We wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create. With the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about their carbon footprint when using air travel. While the overwhelming majority have not changed the amount they travel because of it, it is certainly becoming a more important consideration and people are asking more questions before traveling. We have found that our attitude towards mitigating the effect our business has on the environment has actually become a business benefit. Our competitive pricing structure includes a carbon offset charge, which is passed on, in its entirety, to ClimateCare. By acknowledging our responsibilities in the area of climate control and putting tangible measures in place, we have received considerable positive feedback from clients and business partners. We believe that Jet Republic is at the forefront of modern European business. If every company in Europe could run 100 percent carbon neutral, as Jet Republic does, the world would be a better place.",0.5414584,5104
169,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If your neighbor mentions their green roof you might think they have a moss problem. Maybe they are simply referring to the color. But you're unlikely to think that they have just had a mini ecosystem installed. Majora Carter says green roofs can help alleviate the problems caused by storm water . Simply put, green roofs are gardens on your roof. They come in all shapes and sizes and range from a simple layer of turf to bite-sized hanging gardens of Babylon. But green roofs are not just aesthetic. They have important environmental benefits: they absorb storm water, reduce noise pollution, absorb heat (thus lessening the urban heat-island effect) and add an extra layer of insulation to buildings. That's why they are increasingly being used on new builds as the construction industry looks to make use of greener technologies.. The concept of a green roof goes back centuries: The turf roofed dwellings of the Vikings are early examples, but the modern green roof we know today was developed in Germany 50 years ago. Since then, they have become increasingly popular, yet the industry still struggles against skeptics, who believe green roofs to be expensive and liable to leaking. The exception to the rule has been Germany, where the industry is now annually worth $77 million. Even by the end of the 1990s, 50 million square meters of German roofs, the equivalent of 10 percent of flat roofs, were recorded to be green. The industry is not faring so well in other parts of the world. While the UK has seen a steady increase in interest since the 1960s, a lack of input from the industry and policy-makers has left Britain far behind Germany's booming market. In North America, green roofs have taken even longer to catch on. Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, a Canadian non-profit industry association, conducted a survey in 2005 which indicated that only 233,000 square meters of green roofs existed in North America. But this was up 80 percent from the previous year, and the market continues to grow. Majora Carter, who set up Sustainable South Bronx to help lift the area out of poverty by creating green-collar jobs, is frustrated by this difference between the European and American industries. ""In Germany they are down to $20 per square meter, which is way cheaper than a regular roof here,"" she told CNN. ""There are mandates over there because of the storm water they retain,"" she continued, ""Which is a huge drain on their resources, as it is on ours. What we are trying to do is champion the policies behind storm water."" Storm water is a growing problem in cities. The lack of permeable surfaces are loading drainage systems and increasing the risk of flooding. It's green roofs' ability to retain high levels of precipitation that are seen as way to control and slow the water run-off. The mandates Carter refers to are part of Germany's Green Area and Biotope Area Federal Law. They are not a legal requirement, but through incentives set up at a city level, the mandates have helped to encourage cheaper prices. Dusty Gedge, co-founder of Livingroof.org, a UK Web site promoting the green roof industry, believes it is the government's responsibility to help the industry grow. ""We need government bodies to accept certain civil engineering benefits, such as storm water amelioration, like the Germans, Austrians and Swiss do,"" he told CNN. ""This will encourage uptake."" In many countries, the green roof industry is vulnerable to non-acceptance and a lack of understanding. Gedge says, ""There are problems with the construction industry viewing vegetation as a problem and not a benefit."" Green roofs also struggle against better-known technologies such as solar panels, but Gedge points out, ""Solar panels can work better on green roofs than on gray roofs."" Despite this lack of support, the green roof industry is growing. In London alone, there are approximately 1 million square meters of green roofs planned, with about 200,000 square meters already installed. And as climate change stays in the headlines, the popularity of green roofs is growing. According to Gedge, ""Over the last eight years, green roofs [in the UK] have gone from being a very marginal approach to a mainstream approach. Cities such as London and Sheffield are now asking for them as part of planning applications."" But Gedge also believes that support from local government, as opposed to a centrally driven policy, is key to the industry's growth. ""In Switzerland, green roofs are federal law, but again this is interpreted at a cantonal and city level,"" he told CNN. ""This is a much better approach than driven by the center."" Managing the industry through federal laws offers a general framework which can then be interpreted as needed. In an industry that varies from project to project, this flexibility is a valuable asset. So the green roof industry continues to grow -- but there's a feeling that government support could be better. With a little more encouragement, what once was an eccentric way to roof your home could soon become the universal standard, turning our cities into lush, green metropolises. But then, it's not easy being green. ................................... Would you put a green roof on your home? Do green roofs really help the environment -- or are they an expensive indulgence?

170,"(CNN) -- The number of people worldwide without access to a toilet -- no public restroom, no outhouse, no latrine, no smallest room -- is a whopping 2.6 billion. That's four out of ten people. The bucket toilet is the only thing on offer for millions of black South Africans. According to the World Toilet Organization, 2.2 million people, predominantly children, die every year from diarrhea -- more than from malaria, from AIDS, from TB. That number dwarfs any casualties related to violent conflict. These figures are intrinsically related. The underestimation of fecal contamination is staggering, sobering -- and unfortunately, silencing. Singaporean social-entrepreneur Jack Sim founded the non-profit World Toilet Organization (""the other WTO"") in 2001, as a support network for all existing organizations. It now includes 151 members from 53 countries, which meet once a year to network, discuss sanitation issues and work together toward ""eliminating the toilet taboo and delivering sustainable sanitation."" Goal number one: Making sanitation speakable. ""What we don't discuss, we can't improve,"" insists Sim. This year, the World Toilet Summit & Expo 2008 was held from November 4-6 in Macau under the theme ""Driving Sustainable Sanitation through Market-Based Initiatives."" Indeed, not only is sanitation a good idea, it's a good investment. Biosolids can be composted into fertilizer, sewage can be processed into methane biogas, and even simple latrines in India are producing compost and fertilizer. ""Globally, if universal sanitation were achieved by 2015, it would cost $95 billion, but it would save $660 billion,"" writes Rose George in her newly released book ""The Big Necessity."" Real-world examples follow: ""When Peru had a cholera outbreak in 1991, it cost $1 billion to contain but could have been prevented with $100 million of better sanitation measures."" Or even more alarming: ""Pakistan, for example, spends 47 times more on its military budget than on water and sanitation, though it loses 120,000 people to diarrhea a year."" So while 2.6 billion people have no toilet, how many millions of us simply ""flush and forget""? Eco-sanitation, or the problem of dealing efficiently and ecologically with sewer systems, wastewater, treatment and purification, is no less a serious one. In the UK alone, the sewage system emits some 28.8 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. As sewers become overloaded with urban development, drought strikes various regions of the earth, and potable water becomes increasingly scarce, even the flush toilet is now put into question. Today, those who care are looking at innovative toilet and waste-disposal solutions from India, China and other parts of the developing world, where attitudes and habits are still evolving and open to change.

171,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Charles has converted his 38-year-old Aston Martin to run on biofuel made from surplus wine, his office revealed Tuesday. Prince Charles with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, on a visit to a whiskey distillery in Northern Ireland last month. The car was a 21st birthday present from Queen Elizabeth, and the prince has converted it to run on 100 percent bioethanol as a way to reduce his carbon emissions, his office, Clarence House, said. The prince has also converted his other cars -- several Jaguars, an Audi and a Range Rover -- to run on 100 percent biodiesel fuel made from used cooking oil, his office added. Details of the prince's biofuel use were made public Monday in his household's 2008 Annual Review, which details the prince's income and activities over the past year. The report says Charles and his household reduced their carbon footprint by 18 percent last year after switching to green electricity supplies and reducing their travel-related emissions. Charles, 59, has a strong interest in environmental issues and rural affairs. He is active in environmental charities, and his food company, Duchy Originals, uses ingredients produced at his organic farm in Cornwall, southwestern England. The biofuels are converted and provided by Green Fuels Limited, a British company that previously provided biodiesel to power the royal train, Clarence House said. The wine used for the bioethanol comes from current vintage that remains after English wine producers reach the EU limit for annual wine production, a spokesman for Green Fuels said.

172,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As familiar and reassuring as the map of the world is, there is only so much that physical geography can tell us about the state of the planet. Forest loss: This cartogram shows areas where the worst deforestation occured from 1990 to 2000. A new book, The Atlas of the Real World, has redrawn the map giving vivid new insights and bringing economic, social and environmental data to life. Not since the German meteorologist, Alfred Wegener, sketched out the first detailed theories of continental drift has the world appeared so misshapen, so otherworldly. The 366 cartograms (statistical maps) which make up the book twist, shrink and distend countries and continents into all sorts of shapes and sizes. The book and the accompanying Web site were devised by Daniel Dorling, professor of human geography at the UK's University of Sheffield, Anna Barford, a research associate at Sheffield and Mark Newman, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan. Work on the project began in earnest in 2006 when Dorling teamed up with Newman, who had co-created a new software technique for creating equal area cartograms the year before. With the software in place, the painstaking task of assembling the data began. The information was drawn from a variety of organizations including the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Bank. For ease of visual comparison, territories are split into 12 geographical regions -- e.g. blue for North America, brown for Northern Africa -- and shading marks out specific countries. The range of subjects is impressive, from greenhouse gas emissions, wealth and disease to more obscure data about numbers of dentists and working tractors. John Pritchard, research assistant at University of Sheffield and part of the team working on the project, told CNN: ""I think the maps of disease are particularly shocking and bring home the scale of the problem in Africa better than a table of statistics does."" Indeed, the map of malaria deaths is striking: 94 percent of deaths from malaria occur in Africa, making the continent appear like a vast bloated blob. The rest of the world is reduced to a disparate series of veiny streaks. There are other sobering statistics to consider. In June 2008, Principal Voices spoke to Head of Research at Oxfam GB Duncan Green about strategies to eradicate poverty. Green talked about the education being crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty, particularly for girls. The new atlas's Girls not at Primary School cartogram graphically illustrates the lack of female education in many parts of the developing world. Team members are currently working on a map of languages and soon hope to be producing animated maps. ""We have a series of maps that show deaths at various stages, which would be particularly suited to an animation, and we now have a PhD student looking at extending the Web site, including ways of mapping flow."" Pritchard said.",0.53387487,3977
173,"(CNN) -- Antarctica is warming in line with the rest of the world, according to a new study on climate change in Antarctica. Temperatures across Antarctica have traditionally varied between east and west, scientists say. Rather than being the last bastion to resist global warming, U.S. research has found that for the past 50 years much of the continent of Antarctica has been getting warmer. For years common belief among scientists studying climate change was that a large part of Antarctica, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, has been getting colder while the rest of the world has warmed. However the new research from the University of Washington has found that warming in West Antarctica exceeded one-tenth of a degree Celsius per decade for the past 50 years, which more than offsets the cooling in East Antarctica. ""West Antarctica is a very different place than East Antarctica, and there is a physical barrier, the Transantarctic Mountains, that separates the two,"" said Professor Eric Steig, lead author of the research paper. The study's findings appeared in Thursday's issue of the scientific journal Nature. At 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) above sea level the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is around 4,000 feet lower than East Antarctica and subject to warm, moist storms and more snowfall. In gathering the data Steig and fellow researchers used information from satellites, which was crucial in providing new insight into patterns of temperature change across the continent. Previous research on climate in Antarctica that relied solely on Antarctic weather stations, in place since 1957, could not get as much information about conditions on the interior of the continent as most are placed within a short distance of the coast. ""Simple explanations don't capture the complexity of climate,"" Steig said. ""The thing you hear all the time is that Antarctica is cooling and that's not the case. If anything it's the reverse, but it's more complex than that. Antarctica isn't warming at the same rate everywhere, and while some areas have been cooling for a long time the evidence shows the continent as a whole is getting warmer."" A major reason most of Antarctica was thought to be cooling was because of a hole in the ozone layer that appears during the spring months in the Southern Hemisphere's polar region. Steig noted that it is well established that the ozone hole has contributed to cooling in East Antarctica. ""However, it seems to have been assumed that the ozone hole was affecting the entire continent when there wasn't any evidence to support that idea, or even any theory to support it,"" he said. ""In any case, efforts to repair the ozone layer eventually will begin taking effect and the hole could be eliminated by the middle of this century. If that happens, all of Antarctica could begin warming on a par with the rest of the world.""",0.5338308,2149
174,"(CNN) -- What green gadgets are worth splashing out for? Lucy Siegle, a British journalist specializing in ecological issues and trends, told CNN which eco gizmos get her seal of approval. Solar powered tents . Solar tent: A great green gadget for occasionaly campers. Siegle: I'm not big into camping but it's a massive thing here in the UK. During the summer barely a weekend goes by without a festival of some sort. The only thing however that gets me through the frequently rain-sodden experience is the ingenuity of a solar powered tent (I love them). Fit-PC2: Small is beautiful . Siegle: I'm acutely aware of the specter of e-waste because I make films about fly tipping in beautiful parts of Wales and come face to face with mounds of dumped monitors and keyboards. We have an issue in the UK with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive as there's a lot of crime -- see as evidence how a consignment of e-waste was found in Brazil recently. It's horrible. Anyway all this makes me technologically monogamous -- I keep my machine until the bitter end. However the bitter end is approaching for my Mac Book as half the keys have sprung off so I came across this. The Fit-PC 2.0 claiming to the world's smallest fully functioning PC and also the greenest. 115mm x 101mm x 27 mm. That's tiny! I love dematerialization of these objects.

The main board is lead free.   View a gallery of the gadgets » . Dyson Animal hand-held vacuum cleaner . Siegle: I just got one of these, and have become quite the Stepford wife. Well, as far as crumbs are concerned - my house is a zero tolerance zone. Dyson is the most celebrated UK inventor, famous for the bagless vacuum cleaner. This offspring, the handheld, chargeable vac does some spectacular stuff. It 'spins dust and dirt out of the air' using a motor that spins ten times faster than the engine of a Boeing 747 courtesy of digital switching (subject to 15 patents). Another key factor is that this alternative motor does not cause those polluting carbon particles. All of this may sound rather energy hungry, but the new digital motor is 84 percent energy efficient. The reason I've listed it here is because it has huge potential in all sorts of applications and is a physical embodiment of Dyson's insistence that 'bigger motors don't always equal better performance'. Savaplug . Siegle: This is a retro inclusion (odd for a gadget list I know). I'm into the idea of Dynamic Demand -- regulating flow of power to our homes to even out and to make the grid more efficient (in the UK two thirds of power, mostly produced by coal fired power stations is lost before it gets to our homes). The Savaplug regulates flow on a microscale when you plug in an old style fridge. I don't need mine any more -- I have a new style, energy efficient fridge these days but keep it just in case I find someone who doesn't. Ikea Sunnan solar powered desk lamp . Lucy Siegle: Very simple, but actually very effective. I was sent this as a promotion. When you buy one, another is given free to kids in the developing world who have to study at night. A slightly mawkish, marketing stunt, but one that still appeals. I was amazed how it charged up in my kitchen, without me having to do anything. It was ready when my two year old nephew came to stay, fell out of his bed (I've subsequently got a bed guard for him) and needed the light on. The Sunnan has a warm, comforting glow. Riversimple hydrogen powered car . Lucy Siegle: I recently made a film about hydrogen fuel cells and how a British scientist, Dr Tom Bacon developed fuel cells for the Apollo 11 command center. Nixon (okay, not a president known for his probity) told Bacon that there would have been no mission without Bacon and his fuel cells. Anyway, it made me consider this technology more seriously. At Cranfield University (there are other partners too) they are perfecting a hydrogen fuel cell car. If it was funded like electric -- an easier option for the automotive industry -- it would have taken off by now (to pun from the Apollo connection). Hugo Spowers who is masterminding the project is an ethical visionary. He used to work in Formula One racing -- hardly known for its ethical outlook -- then did a Schumacher course at Dartington, famed for its deep green economics. He also has an MBA from Cranfield and is running this project as a shared commons program. Extraordinarily enlightened.

176,"(CNN) -- Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world. Taken from a small airplane, the photos show men outside thatched communal huts, necks craned upward, pointing bows toward the air in a remote corner of the Amazonian rainforest. The National Indian Foundation, a government agency in Brazil, published the photos Thursday on its Web site. It tracks ""uncontacted tribes"" -- indigenous groups that are thought to have had no contact with outsiders -- and seeks to protect them from encroachment. More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, near the recently photographed tribe, according to Survival International, a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of indigenous people. ""All are in grave danger of being forced off their land, killed or decimated by new diseases,"" the organization said Thursday. Illegal logging in Peru is threatening several uncontacted groups, pushing them over the border with Brazil and toward potential conflicts with about 500 uncontacted Indians living on the Brazilian side, Survival International said. Its director, Stephen Cory, said the new photographs highlight the need to protect uncontacted people from intrusion by the outside world. ""These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist,"" Cory said in a statement. ""The world needs to wake up to this, and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law. Otherwise, they will soon be made extinct.""

177,"Washington (CNN)  -- It feels like it went by in the blink of an eye. Tai Shan, the giant panda cub so many people have come to know and love, is about to board a flight to China. ""It's very bittersweet. We love him. We love having him here,"" said Erika Bauer, curator at the National Zoo in Washington. Tai Shan was born in the nation's capital, so you can confidently call him a Washingtonian. But he is to be sent to China, under an agreement between the two nations, to help replenish the endangered species' numbers in the wild. At 4½ years old, Tai Shan is more of a panda adolescent than a cub, but to Tai Shan fans, he will always be their baby. ""We watched him as he grew up and it's kind of sad to see him go,"" said Kathleen Ryland of Highland, Maryland. Ryland brought her two children to say their goodbyes to Tai Shan at a farewell party at the National Zoo Saturday. Despite the snow falling on the panda exhibit, there were plenty of warm and fuzzy feelings about Tai Shan. ""He's so cute. I'll miss him,"" said Claire Ryland, 7. It's often said that a visit to Washington is not complete without a stop at the zoo to see Tai Shan. Over the years, some have even gone as far to say that Tai Shan was Washington's No. 1 resident -- even getting top billing over the president. Tai Shan will leave for China on Thursday via the ""FedEx Panda Express."" He'll be joined by Mei Lan - a 3-year-old panda born at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia. Eventually, they will take part in a breeding program aimed at increasing the panda population. Giant pandas are currently on the endangered list. The National Zoo estimates that about 1,600 giant pandas are currently in the wild. Bauer says that's all the more reason to say goodbye to Tai Shan.

178,"(CNN) -- German zookeepers in Nuremberg will bottle-feed a four-week-old polar bear and rear it away from its mother after concerns the mother would eat her cub, officials said Thursday. Zookeepers fear the unnamed polar bear cub could be at risk of being eaten. The cub, which doesn't yet have a name, was being cared for at Nuremberg City Zoo, where it was resting under heat lamps and is drinking formula. ""It's gaining weight, it's very hungry, it drinks a lot of milk,"" said Alexandra Foghammar, a spokeswoman for the city. The zoo announced Thursday that the cub is female. Wednesday, the zoo said keepers decided to take the cub away from its mother, Vera, because the mother was showing signs of being upset and confused, taking her baby in and out of the animals' enclosure. ""We were 100 percent sure that the baby was going to die if we didn't take it away from her,"" Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke told Time magazine. ""This would have been a death verdict for the cub."" The zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear, Vilma, had eaten her two offspring. The zoo said it feared Vera would do the same, so it took her cub away as a precaution. Since then, the cub is thriving in the care of humans, but Vera seems to miss her cub, Foghammar said.  Watch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears. » . ""The mother is a little bit nervous,"" she said. ""She walks around and is searching for the baby, but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal. It will continue for three or four days. It's a normal situation."" The zookeepers are pondering whether to bring another adult bear, possibly the cub's father, Felix, to the zoo to help Vera overcome her loss, and are seeking another small bear to serve as a companion for the rescued cub, Time reported. The zoo said a keeper entered Vilma's enclosure Monday and noticed that her two cubs were nowhere to be found. The zoo said it assumes Vilma ate her young because she believed the cubs were sick, though zookeepers say the cubs were last seen on Sunday and appeared in good health. But Foghammar told Time that the separation of the bears was bad for the ""principle of wildlife conservation"" at the zoo: ""Now the cub will not grow up to act in a natural way, just as the mother lacked the experience to bring up a cub."" The plight of the cub follows the case last year of Knut, a cub rejected by its mother at Berlin Zoo who became the focus of a media frenzy after animal rights campaigners called for it to be killed, claiming it had become too dependent on humans.

180,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- James Bond would be lost without them -- those madcap gadgets merging two technologies that help him beat the bad guys and save the planet. The underwater watch with a built-in Geiger counter, for example; or the car that doubles as a submarine; or the exploding bagpipes and missile-launching wheelchair. An artist's impression of what a Flying Electric Generator might look like . Now a U.S. company has taken a leaf out of 007's book and developed a similarly unlikely ""combination"" technology. The ""villain"" in this case is not a psychotic, cat-stroking megalomaniac, but something both more prosaic and, potentially, more threatening -- global warming: in particular, how to meet the world's energy needs without swamping the planet with clouds of atmosphere-clogging pollutants. And the madcap gadget that might just provide a solution? A helicopter that doubles as a wind turbine. Or, to give it its technical name, a FEG (Flying Electric Generator). The brainchild of Australian engineering specialist Professor Bryan Roberts, the FEG is being developed by San Diego-based company SkyWindPower. Code-cracker turned turbine enthusiast . The latter is headed by David Shepard, who started his career cracking Japanese military ciphers during World War Two, and went on to create the Farrington B numeric font that appears on credit cards around the world. Shepard has long been convinced of the need for a new global energy source to reduce reliance on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. For the last two decades his attention has focused on the electricity-generating potential of high-altitude winds, and when he learnt of Professor Roberts' prototype ""gyromill"" -- a flying wind turbine that the Australian had been developing since 1979 -- he decided it offered the best model for realizing that potential. The two men started working together in 2002, and the FEG is the result. High-altitude winds . The guiding principle of the FEG is that wind speed and constancy are far greater at high altitude than they are on the ground, especially in the two major jet streams - the Sub-Tropical Jet and the Polar Front Jet - that exist in each hemisphere (at around 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude respectively). A turbine at great height, so the theory goes, can generate far more power than a similar turbine at or near ground level. It has been estimated that capturing just one percent of the available energy of these high altitude winds would meet the electricity needs of the entire planet. ""The winds a few miles above the mid latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are far stronger and more persistent than the winds just above us,"" Shepard told CNN. ""This results in potentially being able to generate electricity for over eighty percent of the time, as opposed to thirty percent of the time at ground-based wind turbine sites. ""The largest ground-based wind turbines currently produce about five megawatts each. We expect typical FEGs to produce about 20 megawatts each."" Helicopter technology . But how do we get a working turbine up to the necessary height -- at least 15,000 ft (4600 meters) above the earth's surface? That's where helicopter technology comes in. Taking the form of a giant H-shaped frame, the prototype FEG has four huge blades at the four points of the H, each blade 10.7 meters (35 feet) in diameter. These act like the rotors of a helicopter, lifting the FEG to the required height. Once in place, the blades not only keep the FEG air-born, providing lift like the surface area of a kite, but also act as turbines, turning dynamos within the platform that generate electricity, which is transmitted back to earth through a vast aluminum tethering cable. An in-built GPS (Global Positioning System) uses satellite technology to ensure that the FEG always remains in the same place, both vertically and horizontally. According to Shepard, development is already at an advanced stage. ""Professor Roberts demonstrated a FEG in Australia at an altitude of sixty feet over a decade ago,"" he told CNN. U.S. demonstration in three years . ""We expect to make a demonstration in the U.S. less than three years from now at high altitude in normal high altitude winds. In four years I would expect this sort of technology to be in active use."" As with ground-based wind farms, Shepard envisages whole ""sky-farms"" of FEGs hovering above the earth in restricted airspace. Forty-three such FEG ""arrays"" -- each comprising 600 FEGs -- would, he estimates, generate sufficient electricity to power the whole of the U.S. ""Our calculations show that by reserving less than one four-hundredth of U.S. air space, located at relatively remote locations not on airway routes, all of America's electrical energy needs could be met,"" he says. ""That is considerably less airspace than is already restricted for other purposes, primarily military."" Not only would the FEGs provide clean energy -- the feedback from environmental groups, according to Shepard, has been overwhelmingly positive -- but at less cost than conventional electricity generation. While each FEG would cost an estimated $2,260,000 to build, maintain and support, arrays of FEGS would, in the long term, prove extremely cost effective, generating electricity at about 2 cents per kilowatt hour, as opposed to the 3-5 cents of conventional generating methods. There are risks, of course. Even in restricted airspace there is the possibility of collision with aircraft that unwittingly -- or illegally -- stray into that airspace. Likewise, despite numerous design features aimed at ensuring the stability of the air-born FEG, the possibility of the structure malfunctioning and plummeting to earth cannot be excluded. Crashes ""inevitable"" ""Inevitably crashes will occur,"" the SkyWindPower Web site acknowledges, ""Just as airplane crashes occur. ""Statistically, however, FEGs should be just as reliable as commercial airliners, whose safety records are incredibly good. ""And FEGs don't take off or land at airports teeming with people in and around them."" Shepard and Roberts are not the only people to have considered harnessing the power of high-altitude winds. Magenn Power, a Canadian company, have been developing a helium-filled, medium altitude wind generator, while in the Netherlands Laddermill has been exploring similar ground using kite technology. SkyWindPower's FEG, however, is at the forefront of the field, with the U.S. government showing considerable interest in the prototype helicopter-cum-wind-turbine. Whether it will provide a definitive solution to the world's ever-increasing energy needs remains to be seen.

181,"(Budget Travel) -- In the lodging world, green has gone mainstream. Once chided for being wasteful, the big hotel chains are now constantly trying to one-up each other with smart eco-design upgrades and stringent water and energy conservation policies. Hyatt has begun recycling its own aluminum, plastics and paper in countries where such programs don't exist. Consider this fact: In a recent survey, 68 percent of U.S. hotels said they had energy-efficient lights, and two thirds had implemented towel- and linen-reuse programs, up from just over half five years ago. The number of properties trying to become LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified, the most recognized standard for building sustainability, is also on the rise: Applications to the U.S. Green Building Council for the award spiked by 550 percent between 2006 and 2008. More than 500 hotels could soon earn the label; until four years ago, only one had the designation. Although all the major players are making strides toward better green policies, some are doing more than others. Here's what the leaders have achieved in four earth-changing categories: . ENERGY CONSERVATION . Replacing inefficient lighting, one energy-draining bulb at a time . Accor: More than 8,600 Motel 6 locations in at least a dozen states have been retrofitted with occupancy sensors that cause the thermostat to readjust when guests go out. InterContinental: A trial program has been rolled out at 650 hotels that aims to cut energy consumption by as much as 25 percent. If successful, it could be expanded to all of the chain's 4,000 properties, including Holiday Inns. Marriott: Over the past decade, 450,000 incandescent bulbs have been replaced with compact fluorescent ones, and more than 250 hotels (including some Residence Inns) have earned an Energy Star efficiency label from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Starwood: The new Element brand's goal is for every hotel to be LEED certified. Its first property, which opened last year in Lexington, Massachusetts, is fully loaded with Energy Star appliances, LED lighting, and top-notch ventilation systems. All together, that saves enough energy annually to power 236 homes. WATER CONSERVATION . Tightening up on all the drips and drops in hotel bathrooms . Hilton: The company's aim: to reduce water use at all of its brands, such as Hilton, DoubleTree, and Embassy Suites, by 10 percent by 2014. Its nearly 90 European properties have taken the lead, installing water-saving toilets, showerheads, and faucets over the past three years. Home-turf hotels are next. Hyatt: Nearly all North American properties have ""low-flow"" showerheads (which use a maximum of 2.5 gallons of water per minute) and toilets (1.6 gallons of water per flush). The improvements helped reduce the chain's overall water consumption by 3 percent in 2007. Marriott: Over the past 10 years, the company has added some 400,000 low-flow showerheads and toilets to all of its locations worldwide. Marriott also buys 1 million towels annually that don't require prewashing, conserving 6 million gallons of water each year. Starwood: All new Element hotels will have low-flow water fixtures in rooms and water-efficient landscaping; its Lexington star has led the way, saving up to 1 million gallons of water per year. GREEN DESIGN . Thinking about the environment from the foundation up . Accor: The Motel 6 brand broke ground last year on an ultra-green building near Dallas, with laminate flooring made from recycled wood chips and a solar-powered water-heating system. Best Western: Opening this year in Golden, Colorado, the chain's first LEED-certified hotel will run partially on solar power and have a porous asphalt parking lot to reduce storm-water runoff. Hilton: The company's green gem is in Vancouver, Washington: a LEED-approved hotel with low-emission paint on the walls and special drains that funnel rainwater into wells for future use. Hyatt: Seattle's Hyatt at Olive 8, which opened in January, has an 8,000-square-foot rooftop garden, water-efficient dual-flush toilets, outlets in the parking lot for electric cars, and lighting controlled by room key cards. Marriott: In 2005, the Marriott in College Park, Maryland, was the first chain hotel in the U.S. to become LEED certified. Among the earth-friendly frills: kitchen composting, in-room recycling bins, water pitchers instead of plastic bottles, and an organic restaurant. Starwood: All eight Element locations being built across the country this year have carpets and cushions made from recycled materials, art mounted on frames constructed from old tires, and priority parking for guests with hybrids. RECYCLING . Allowing not a single can, bottle, or plastic key card to go to waste . Hyatt: Starting this year, the company will only use key cards and shampoo and lotion containers made from recycled plastics. Hyatt has also begun recycling its own aluminum, plastics, and paper in countries such as Russia and Chile where such programs don't exist. Intercontinental: As part of a pilot program started two years ago, about 140 Candlewood Suites properties donated old furniture and linens to local families following renovations -- helping to cut back on landfill. It hopes to replicate the initiative nationwide. Marriott: Each year, the chain buys 47 million pens and 24 million key cards made from recycled plastics; it has also eliminated Styrofoam and plastic utensils at all of its locations. Coming soon: bed pillows made from the polyester fibers of recycled plastic bottles. Wyndham: Debuting later this year at Super 8 motels across the country: new staff uniforms fashioned entirely from recycled plastic bottles.

182,"(CNN) -- Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world. Indigenous Brazilians are photographed during an overflight in May, reacting to the sights over their camp. Taken from a small airplane, the photos show men outside thatched communal huts, necks craned upward, pointing bows toward the air in a remote corner of the Amazonian rainforest. The National Indian Foundation, a government agency in Brazil, published the photos Thursday on its Web site. It tracks ""uncontacted tribes"" -- indigenous groups that are thought to have had no contact with outsiders -- and seeks to protect them from encroachment. More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, near the recently photographed tribe, according to Survival International, a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of indigenous people. ""All are in grave danger of being forced off their land, killed or decimated by new diseases,"" the organization said Thursday. Illegal logging in Peru is threatening several uncontacted groups, pushing them over the border with Brazil and toward potential conflicts with about 500 uncontacted Indians living on the Brazilian side, Survival International said. Its director, Stephen Cory, said the new photographs highlight the need to protect uncontacted people from intrusion by the outside world. ""These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist,"" Cory said in a statement. ""The world needs to wake up to this, and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law. Otherwise, they will soon be made extinct."" The photos released Thursday show men who look strong and healthy, the Brazilian government said. They and their relatives apparently live in six communal shelters known as malocas, according to the government, which has tracked at least four uncontacted groups in the region for the past 20 years.

183,"BETHESDA, Maryland (CNN) -- Josh Winston is a self-described problem solver. From his spacious office on the seventh floor of a high-rise building in Bethesda, Maryland, he fills out tax returns and keeps the books balanced for a number of his accounting clients. Josh Winston stands outside the 1983 RV he was converting to run on vegetable oil. ""Everything on the left always equals everything on the right. For math-oriented people and musicians like me, that's very satisfying,"" he says. Four years ago, Winston was watching a late-night news program and saw a segment about converting diesel vehicles to run on alternative fuels. That night, Winston was hooked. He ordered a conversion kit for $900 and proceeded to convert a truck to run on used vegetable oil -- just to see if he could. Soon after, he converted his 1998 Jetta and affixed a sticker to the rear bumper that said, ""This vehicle runs on straight vegetable oil."" ""For a single bumper sticker, I was surprised at how many people stopped me and said, 'Hey, how do you do that?' "" Before taking on his first conversion, he hadn't worked on a car since his 1978 Plymouth Volare -- which he drove in college. By Winston's estimate, there are fewer than 10,000 vehicles on the road that have undergone these diesel conversions. Now, he sells and installs his own kits -- and he's the only person in the Washington, D.C., area to offer the service. Though his side business, named ""Feed My Wheels dot com,"" has only converted a handful of vehicles, he recently took on his largest project by far -- a 1983 Itasca RV. ""There's a lot of trial and error,"" says Winston.  Watch the ""problem solver"" at work » . Over the course of two days, Winston ran into many a problem. First, the batteries kept dying. Later, there was an issue with the alternator. By the end of Day 2, as Winston was preparing to fill a 40-gallon veggie-oil tank in the RV with recycled oil from a Chinese food restaurant, a neighbor watching him tipped over an 80-gallon holding tank, spilling tens of gallons of brown, smelly oil down his street. ""It's OK,"" Winston quipped, ""earthworms love this stuff."" After nearly 50 hours of cutting and reattaching hoses, Winston managed to get the RV running and successfully switched over to the vegetable oil tank. He claims that veggie-oil emissions are about half of those of petroleum-based diesel fuel. ""If you're emitting half the carbon dioxide that our neighbor is, that means one of two things: Either your neighbor can drive twice as much, or you're having a significant positive impact on the environment,"" Winston says. ""In some small way, we're contributing to saving the environment. It's going to save a glacier somewhere.""",0.5239588,4313

Borlaug died from cancer complications in Dallas, Texas, a spokeswoman for Texas A&M University said. A 1970 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Borlaug was a distinguished professor of international agriculture at the university. Borlaug started at Texas A&M in 1984, after working as a scientist in a program that introduced scientific techniques for preventing famine in Mexico, according to the university. Until recently, he traveled worldwide working for improvements in agricultural science and food policy, said Kathleen Phillips, a university spokeswoman. Borlaug was known as a champion of high-yield crop varieties, and other science and agricultural innovations to help fight hunger in developing nations. iReport.com: Tour Borlaug's boyhood farm . ""We all eat at least three times a day in privileged nations, and yet we take food for granted,"" Borlaug said recently in an interview posted on the university's Web site.

185,"(CNN) -- Giant jellyfish descend on the Sea of Japan, causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind. A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005. Sounds like a great sci-fi flick. But it's not. It's real and a nightmare for Japanese fishermen. The massive sea creatures, called Nomura's jellyfish, can grow 6 feet (1.83 meters) in diameter and weigh more than 450 pounds (204 kilos). Scientists think they originate in the Yellow Sea and in Chinese waters. For the third year since 2005, ocean currents are transporting them into the Sea of Japan. Monty Graham, a marine biologist at Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents. He said they stay together in packs and as they drift northward, they get caught in fishermen's nets. The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world. But Nomura's stands out because of its enormous size. ""The sheer size of them, individually, makes them fairly spectacular,"" Graham said. Spectacular, perhaps, to scientists, but perilous to villagers along the Japanese coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past. They had giant-jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007, and because they've recently been spotted in the Sea of Japan, they're bracing for another, potentially harmful wave this summer. The jellyfish destroy fishermen's nets, getting trapped in them, tearing holes and ruining catches. Fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers. When swarms of giant jellyfish tear them, the result is devastating. ""Communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets,"" Graham said. ""When these nets get wiped out, it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community."" The good news is that previous attacks have prompted Japan to put in place a warning system for fishermen. While they still risk losing a big catch, they can, at least, save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish. It's not clear why waves of Nomura's jellyfish have made it to the Sea of Japan in recent years. Some have speculated that overfishing, pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on Nomura's jellyfish in the polyp stage. However, no one is certain, Graham said.",0.5178852,6422
186,"(CNN) -- Arctic reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia are getting a view from space to help them look after their herds as the region copes with climate change. Snow worries: Satellite maps of snow coverage and melt can help reindeer herders. Using satellite-based snow melt maps supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) backed program Polar View, herders are able to view the depth of snow and judge where the best foraging spots are to take their reindeer. ""Snow is of paramount importance for reindeer herding, because its quality determines whether reindeer are able to access the pastures that lie beneath it for much of the year,"" Anders Oskal, the Director of the International Center for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR) told the ESA. ""Detailed circumpolar snow information is, thus, becoming increasingly important following the recent changes in the Arctic climate."" Oskal is working with Sámi reindeer herders in Finnmark, Norway, to help them maintain and develop sustainable reindeer husbandry. According to Oskal, Finnmark is the area of Norway that is predicted to experience the largest temperature increases, raising concerns about whether ice layers will form over pastures preventing reindeer from foraging. Under the Polar View initiative, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) have been providing snow melt maps for Norway and Sweden, as well as snow cover maps for Eurasia, for the last 18 months. The ICR partnered with Polar View in a trial of the maps to examine how satellite observations could help by gathering information on snow change in a timely manner for such vast circumpolar regions. ""The experience so far has definitely been positive, and the reindeer herders are extremely interested in the future utilization of Polar View products that can relate important information about local snow conditions,"" said Oskal. ""These products could have important consequences for herders' decisions regarding winter pasture quality and potential migration routes."" In addition to climate change, reindeer herders also have to face a loss of pastures because of infrastructure development, such as roads, hydroelectric power dams and cabin resorts. The same technology would help the ICR to monitor the different forms of land-use change over time.",0.5158334,2287
188,"(CNN) -- A giant panda at the San Diego Zoo gave birth to a cub the size of a stick of butter on Wednesday, her fifth cub born in the zoo since 1999. The public can view live video of the cub and its mother, Bai Yun, on the zoo's Web site. The sex of the mostly hairless, pink newborn, which was born around 5 a.m., is not known yet, said Dr. Ron Swaisgood of the zoo's Institute of Conservation Research. It will take about one month for the iconic black-and-white coloration of the giant panda to become visible, Swaisgood said. Its mother, Bai Yun, will care for the newborn by herself until she starts leaving the den regularly, at which time members of the zoo's giant panda team will step in briefly to check on the cub, he said. ""She is a very experienced mother. She raised all of her other cubs until about 1.5 years, the natural age for separation,"" Swaisgood told CNN Radio. ""She's a real pro."" Weighing in around 300 pounds, Bai Yun is about 1,000 times the size of her cub, who weighs around 4 ounces., the typical size of a baby panda, Swaisgood said. ""Pandas give birth to what's called very 'altricial' cubs. That means they are very small and fragile. This cub would probably weigh about 4 ounces. It would be pink and hairless and completely dependent on the mother,"" he said. The birth is considered a success for the zoo's Institute for Conservation Research, which works with research and breeding centers around the world to boost the endangered panda population . Herself a model of that effort, Bai Yun was the first panda to be born and survive at the breeding center of the China Center for Research and Conservation of the Giant Panda in the Wolong Nature Reserve in 1991. She has given birth to four other cubs since arriving at the San Diego Zoo in 1996 from China. Two of them have since been returned to China, Swaisgood said. The newborn's father, Gao Gao, is a wild-born giant panda that arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 2003 from the Wolong Nature Reserve. He will not be involved in raising the cub. The cub will remain in the den with its mother for a few months and gradually start to come out as soon as it is able to walk, Swaisgood said. In four to five months, the cub will be ready for the public, Swaisgood said. Until then, the public can view live video of the cub and its mother on the zoo's Web site.

The surviving twin was doing well, the zoo said, but added that it was concerned the mother may not be able to care for it properly. Zookeepers watching a video feed from the bears' enclosure said they had noticed the baby bear looking thinner and weaker. They saw the bears' mother, Vera, nudging the dead bear with her nose and observing it -- and as of Wednesday, they said, the dead bear was nowhere to be seen. ""It is very, very sad,"" said zoo director Dag Encke. ""it is unfortunately frequently the case that with twins, one of the animals doesn't survive."" Zookeepers had kept their distance from Vera and her babies, watching them only on camera so as not to make the mother feel threatened. Polar bears are known to eat their young if they sense any danger or interference.

Jookie, as she is known, studies a poster of French gorilla Yeboah, who is heading for London Zoo. So when three female gorillas at London Zoo heard that they would soon be visited by a brooding French hunk -- well, they went a bit bananas. The latest development in Anglo-French relations sees Yeboah, a 20-stone 12-year-old, leave his current home at La Boissiere Du Dore Zoo, Pays de la Loire, northwest France and head for the British capital by the end of the year. There he will be greeted by gorilla trio Zaire, Effie and Mjukuu, who were given posters of their prospective boyfriend for the first time Thursday. One female gorilla shrieked in delight, while another wedged the poster in a tree to stare at it. A third, clearly overcome by emotion, held the photo close to her chest -- then ate it. Their reception was somewhat unsurprising. The zoo has been without a male gorilla since the demise of Bobby, a silverback, in December.  Tracey Lee, team leader at London Zoo, put in a good word for the hirsute lothario on the London Zoo Web site, saying Yeboah is ""a very charming, fun loving and intelligent gorilla."" But whom will Yeboah choose to charm first? Zaire, at 34, is the oldest female gorilla and has been at London Zoo since 1984.

193,"Montcoal, West Virginia (CNN) -- I am West Virginia born and raised, and I come from a long line of coal miners. My father, grandfather, brothers, husband and son-in-law either are or were coal miners. My husband spent 35 years as an underground union coal miner and he died of black lung. I live near Coal River Mountain and my community is experiencing a tragedy. The situation here, before this disaster, had already compelled me to become an environmental activist, committed to doing everything I can to stop the destructive practice of coal extraction known as mountaintop removal. I am not trying to stop all coal mining. I believe coal mining will be with us for a very long time, considering our enormous thirst for energy and our slow transition to renewable energy. Throughout Appalachia, 2,000 miles of headwater streams have been destroyed and over 500 mountains have been decapitated by mountaintop removal. I stood by and did nothing until Massey Energy brought this fight to my door. Three years ago, Massey applied for a permit to blow the top off the mountain behind my house. The company plans to level 6,600 acres of Coal River Mountain and turn it into a moonscape where no living, breathing thing can survive. I believe a higher and better use for this mountain is the Coal River Wind Project. On Monday, April 5, an enormous explosion went off at the Upper Big Branch mine at Performance Coal Co., a subsidiary of Massey Energy. Thirty-one men in our community didn't come home that day. We don't yet know the names of all of the deceased and I dread the day when the list is read and we, at last, know our connection to those who didn't make it. I felt extremely blessed when I knew that my family members who worked at this mine were home and safe. I know many friends and neighbors will be among those we lost and I grieve for all of the families involved. On April 6, many heartbroken and terrified families kissed their loved ones at the door and sent them off back to work underground. These very brave men enter these mines knowing their fate will probably be the same as their friends' on April 5 or the same as my husband's. Now, although these very proud, brave and strong men make about $70,000 a year, if they had a choice, many of them would never go underground again. The problem is that we live in a mono-economy and there are no choices. The coal industry has a death grip in the state of West Virginia and we have some of the best politicians money can buy. We also have some very honest, good and environmentally friendly politicians. Their numbers are small and it is considered to be political suicide to do anything in West Virginia that appears to be anti-coal. Many of our representatives have tunnel vision and refuse to advocate for job diversity in the coal fields. Coal is a finite resource, and no matter when you think, it will eventually run out -- someday we will have harvested all of the economically feasible coal. When that day comes, how will the people we love support their families? I live at ground zero for mountaintop removal and because of the stand that I and many other people have taken to stop it, tensions run high in the coal fields. We are all being used by an outlaw industry and corrupt politicians and we are all driven by fear. The men who work in surface mining are terrified they will lose their jobs. I am terrified that my granddaughter will not have clean drinking water when she is of child-bearing age if we don't stop this. Massey Energy's record speaks for itself. With an enormous amount of violations and previous deaths at this mine, I will leave it to you to decide if this company puts profits before the safety of its workers or views its employees as a disposable commodity. We are coping with this enormous tragedy, and sometimes tragedy brings communities together. I can only hope that something good will come out of all of this bad.

196,"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- For the past few years, Dan Redmond has been on a mission to change the way his household uses energy. Dan Redmond uses an electric bicycle with a trailer to run errands. As concerns about global warming and rising energy costs grow, many families like the Redmonds are looking for ways to change the way they use energy. Three years ago Redmond began embracing solar energy to power his suburban Washington home. And he's not alone in turning to the sun for energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates there are about 250,000 homes in the United States with some sort of solar power, although not all of them have taken the concept as far as the Redmonds. Last year, 13,000 homes installed solar power. ""We're just making different decisions about how we live our life,"" Redmond said, ""And what's important to us as well, as being able to show our two boys that when they grow up they're going to need to know to be more flexible in most parts of their life and they're going to need to be adaptable."" Redmond's excitement about solar energy has changed his family's daily routine and also saved money -- he paid $28.61 for electricity last month compared with $150 a month last year. The biggest change came when Redmond put solar panels on the roof of his 1925 bungalow, which he shares with his wife, Margaret McGilvray, and the couple's two young sons. The system, which still allows the family to use energy from the traditional power grid when the sun is not shining, uses what is known as net-metering. No electricity is stored in the house. Energy produced in excess of what is needed is fed back to the power grid, effectively making the Redmonds' electric meter run backward. Twelve panels on the roof feed power to a device in the basement called an inverter. The solar power system cost $23,000 after a $2,000 tax credit. Redmond estimates that the system will pay for itself in 10 to 15 years. ""As we know, our power rates are going up."" He said ""So it probably will take less because that number is based on what we're paying right now. ""About 80 percent of our power is used with the solar panels."" Redmond says. To get that kind of benefit, though, the family greatly cut the amount of energy they use. ""We've made a real effort to reduce how much electricity we need to use in the first place, which is much less expensive to do than to produce energy that you're wasting inside of your home."" The biggest lifestyle change is as low-tech as the solar panels are high-tech -- the family uses a clothesline to dry its laundry. ""It's OK just to simply hang your lines ... and not use your dryer,"" says Redmond, who cut his electric bill by 15 to 20 percent by ditching the dryer. ""That to me would be the very first thing anybody should do in terms of conserving electricity for their home."" Redmond cooks using a solar oven, a small appliance that uses four reflectors, to heat food in Redmond's front yard. The device uses only solar power and leaves no carbon footprint. Richmond says he can heat food to about 350 degrees in his solar oven, but the stove's manufacture says it can heat food up to 400 degrees. On the days when the sun is not shining, the family uses their traditional oven powered from electricity provided by the power grid. The family also uses a small array of solar panels to charge iPods and cell phones. Whenever possible, Redmond runs errands on an electric bicycle that pulls a small trailer. Every little bit helps keep their power bill low. Redmond works from home as a photographer, and McGilvray telecommutes as a consultant for IBM. The couple decided that since they spend a lot of time in their 1,400-square-foot home, and not much time on the road, their best option for saving energy was the solar panels. ""We had several years of back and forth consternation. Should we buy the Prius? Should we get the solar panels?"" Redmond said. ""What we decided is, opposed to spending that same amount of money on a hybrid, let's offset what we're using for our home and business from our roof. ... This would make much more difference in how we live."" For Redmond, it's not just about the money. ""It was more about what we thought was important for ourselves and the decisions we're making for our family,"" he said. Yet he does look forward to many years of lower power bills. ""This system that we have on our roof is going to last 30 years, which will put me into my 70s,"" he said. ""That's a lot of free energy.""",0.50627947,4394
197,"You wanted to know more about greenwashing, and Scot Case, from environmental marketing firm TerraChoice, answered. Greenwashing expert Scot Case of TerraChoice . ""Why are green products often more expensive than ones that don't say they are green or environmentally friendly? Is it just because green has become a new form of 'premium brand'? Isn't this bad news if we want to make more people environmentally aware when they go shopping?"" Harriet Gladwell . Case: First, it should be noted that not all greener products are more expensive. The remanufactured toner cartridges I purchase at a nationwide office-supply store, for example, carry the same warranty as other cartridges at a 30-percent lower cost. This greener option is less expensive because the manufacturer avoids the cost of manufacturing the plastic and electronic components. They simply reuse the parts from recycled cartridges. There are also greener products that do not cost extra. There are cleaning products and paints, for example, that have been certified as meeting tough environmental standards by EcoLogo or Green Seal that deliver the same high-quality performance one expects without costing any extra. Other greener products might be slightly more expensive initially, but generate substantial savings for the consumer. Energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs), for example, are still four times more expensive than traditional cheap incandescent light bulbs. However, CFLs use 75 percent less electricity and last 10 times longer, so they don't have to be replaced as frequently. As a result, the typical CFL saves consumers $30 over the life of the bulb. There are now energy- or water-efficient versions of all sorts of products -- refrigerators, windows, air conditioners, televisions, dishwashers, ovens, showerheads, washing machines, etc. The more efficient versions are typically more expensive initially to reflect the higher-quality components used to make them, but they quickly pay for themselves in lower energy and water costs. Look for products that are Energy Star registered. Even better, look for products that have been independently certified as meeting the Energy Star standards. Why are other greener products still more expensive sometimes? It boils down to the simple laws of supply and demand. Any new innovative product, whether it is ""greener"" or not, costs extra initially. It costs money to research and develop the product and to build the factories and supply chains it takes to make the product. Manufacturers try to recoup those costs as quickly as possible during the initial sales of the product. As demand increases, however, additional manufacturing efficiencies -- economies of scale -- begin to emerge that permit the prices to fall. In addition, high prices attract competitors with similar products, and the additional competition helps force prices lower. Are some manufacturers attempting to earn additional revenue by presenting their greener options as a premium brand? Absolutely. Just as some clothing manufacturers charge extra to have their name brand applied to a shirt. It is also possible, however, to buy high-quality, greener products, at very good prices, at growing numbers of mainstream retail outlets. When DVD players and cell phones were first introduced, they were only available to the very wealthy. Now everyone has at least one. The same is increasingly true with greener product offerings. ""What are the most obvious signs that a company is greenwashing the public with false claims? What words and phrases should raise a red flag?"" Carla Dos Santos . The most obvious sign a company is greenwashing is if the company fails to provide proof of their environmental claims. Legitimate environmental claims can be certified by independent outside third-party auditors. Manufacturers can also provide test data and other relevant information on Web sites. Consumers should also beware of generic environmental claims that are so vague they are likely to be misunderstood. Watch out for broad claims like ""eco-friendly,"" ""earth kind,"" ""all natural,"" ""eco-safe"" or other green babble. Even phrases like ""biodegradable,"" ""recyclable"" and ""compostable"" can be misleading if they fail to clarify how the products were tested or under what circumstances the claim is true. Make sure any environmental claim is specific, backed by proof, and, preferably, verified by an independent, outside third-party. For additional greenwashing examples and recommendations on how to avoid being fooled, check out the Six Sins of Greenwashing or the accompanying wallet-size guide book. ""Is it possible to put together information about a product's greenness that has both the detail that's really needed, and is at the same time simple and clear? And how can we get governments to serve the public and advise them on green purchasing, in the way that is most fair to commercial interests?"" Rick Reibstein . There are certainly efforts underway to provide consumers with additional information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions. The traditional environmental standards such as Green Seal and EcoLogo publish standards and then certify products meeting those standards. Most consumers find the simplicity of this type of certification scheme the most useful. Some particularly savvy green consumers, however, want additional information beyond knowing that a product has been certified as meeting a standard. They are seeking information presented in a nutrition-label format that allows them to compare two certified products to determine which is greener. I think we will see the emergence of hybrid labeling systems that do provide greater detail about the environmental features of a product. Such a label would combine the traditional ""thumbs up or thumbs down"" approach of Green Seal or EcoLogo along with additional information in a standard format. The information might be available on product packaging or on an accompanying Web site. Governments are actually already pushing manufacturers to provide this level of detail using their purchasing power rather than their legislative power. Government purchasers across North America, for example, are demanding safer, more environmentally preferable cleaning products, papers, paints, vehicles, building products, office equipment and computers. Government purchasers in New York, Illinois, California, Minnesota, and other places, for example, require cleaning products to meet the Green Seal or EcoLogo cleaning-product standards. As a result, those products are becoming more widely available for consumers too. The U.S. Federal government and many state governments are also purchasing more environmentally preferable computer products. They are requiring products to meet the EPEAT green computer standard. One unique feature of the EPEAT label is that the EPEAT Web site provides additional information on the environmental features associated with the almost 1,000 products on the EPEAT registry. Now that the information is available, consumers can use the EPEAT information to make their own purchasing decisions. Providing this level of environmental information is the foundation of market-based environmentalism. Government purchasers, other large purchasers such as colleges and universities or Fortune 1000 companies, and individual consumers can use the publicly available information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions along with traditional factors like price and quality to determine how they will spend their hard-earned money. This approach allows the greenest products to be identified and to compete with other products for market share. Of course, in addition to the market-based approach, governments always have it within their power to actually legislate minimum environmental requirements or the publication of basic environmental information. There are persistent rumors of efforts underway to use the legislative power of the federal government to encourage greater transparency regarding the environmental footprint of a product and to make it easier to share that information with consumers. It will be interesting to see what happens in Congress with a new U.S. president in January. ""How can we know if the 'green' label is credible, and do you think we'll ever get to the place where all these different certifications merge into one consistent and widely recognized label? Is this happening in any countries?"" Amber Wells . While there were only three or four eco-labels 20 years ago -- EcoLogo was North America's first and it was founded in 1988 -- there are now more than 300. At some point, I think it is inevitable that there will be some significant consolidation in the environmental-labeling world. There are already numerous meetings among the most legitimate environmental-labeling programs to collaborate more closely. A variety of efforts are attempting to separate the truly green labels from the fake green ones. There are also persistent rumors of pending federal legislation to encourage or even require greater accountability. Until then, consumers need to be aware that not all green-labeling programs are created equally. Before relying on any ""green dot"" to help make a purchasing decision, consumers need to understand exactly what the ""green dot"" means. Make sure you can answer the following questions about an environmental label before making a purchase: . (1) Who created the labeling program? -- Was it created by a manufacturer or a trade association to promote their own products, or was it created by an independent outside organization in an open, public, transparent process? Is it backed by a respected European or North American government? (2) Does the label require a product to actually meet a specific standard? -- Some labels are being awarded based on fees paid to a consultant rather than based on compliance with a published standard. Others are being awarded simply by joining a trade association or paying a membership fee. (3) Does the label address multiple environmental issues or does it focus narrowly on just a single issue like energy-efficiency or recycled-content? -- Review the standard to determine whether it covers multiple environmental issues throughout the entire product life-cycle, which includes the raw materials used to make the product, the manufacturing process, transportation and packaging, and the impacts of using and discarding or recycling the product. Make sure the standard covers the environmental issues you and the environmental community are most concerned about. (4) What does a manufacturer have to do to prove a product meets the standard? -- Some labels permit a manufacturer to determine on its own whether it meets the published standard. Other programs -- including EcoLogo, Green Seal, and the Chlorine Free Products Association -- independently review product test data and visit the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the standard. There is a three-page appendix to the Six Sins of Greenwashing report that provides additional information to help identify legitimate environmental standards.

198,"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- The plastic Ziploc bag thrown in the trash in Seattle, Washington, spent a week traveling 300 miles to an Oregon landfill. The old Apple iBook that was recycled is a month into its journey. And a pair of worn Asics running shoes is still logging miles even after being dropped in a bin for used shoes. Those are just some of the trails of trash exposed in a high-tech trash study. ""Normally, you think about the trash for minutes while you take it out to the can,"" says Ethan O'Connor, ""and this trash we are going to be watching on our Web browsers for weeks."" O'Connor and Shannon Cheng are volunteers in a study tracking their trash -- and giving them the opportunity to reflect on what they use and discard. The tracking devices are about the size of small cell phones and allow for near-real-time tracking of thousands of pieces of garbage. The tracking is not part of some top-secret government program to spy on garbage, but rather the brainchild of MIT researchers who wanted to learn if society could more efficiently dispose of what it throws out. ""The idea with this tagging exercise is to bring an invisible system to life,"" said Assaf Biderman, associate director of MIT's SENSEable City Lab. ""By knowing how long it stays in the system, where it goes, we are hoping to create an increased awareness in the public."" Before that increased awareness could be created, however, the scientists needed to devise a way to track pieces of trash, some for hundreds of miles and for up to six months. Researchers are doing most of the tracking via volunteers in Seattle. They plan to expand the program to other cities and compare the attitudes that people in different regions have about garbage. Working with the telecommunications company Qualcomm, the MIT researchers created a device -- or, as the researchers call them, ""traces"" -- that could track a piece of trash using both GPS and cell phone towers. The researchers then asked volunteers to supply items they were already planning to get rid of and put the tracking ""traces"" on the items. The volunteers then threw the material out as they usually would. Just getting the trace on the piece of trash presented its own challenges. Some needed to be taped or sewn into the garbage; others were stuck to the trash with a sticky aerosol spray. The researchers stipulated that the trace not alter how the garbage traveled through the waste system or call attention to the item. ""The thing about trash is that each object is very different,"" Biderman said. ""Different sizes, different textures, different constraints."" O'Connor and Cheng live on a houseboat, where space is at a premium. Participating in the study has allowed the couple to think of larger-picture issues about the trash they produce. But it's not just the trash's owners who are tracking the tems. Waste Management Inc., a waste removal and recycling company, is helping fund the study in the hope that it will show that the trash they dispose of goes where it should. Officials say they are also looking for ways to better deal with garbage. ""It could make a huge difference,"" Waste Management spokeswoman Rita Smith said. ""We want to do everything we can to get our materials to their destinations as efficiently as possible; not only because of the economic cost, but also because of the environmental cost. There's no point in hauling material around in circles."" Researchers are still compiling data as the trash makes its journey. Even though the study has not been completed, the MIT group sees its efforts as a step toward better informing Americans about trash. ""Can we create a situation of minimum waste?"" Biderman said. ""In a certain way, it's about telling people about what they throw away, making people more aware about waste, and perhaps changing their behavior."" Participating in the study has already altered O'Connor's outlook. ""The disposal is one part of it, the using is another,"" he said. ""No one's saying we are bad people for using stuff, but the reality is each one of us gets one-six-billionth of what the Earth can produce, and what we have is much more than that.""",0.5005272,9304

200,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The world's population is forecast to hit 7 billion in 2011, the vast majority of its growth coming in developing and, in many cases, the poorest nations, a report released Wednesday said. Riders cram into a train last month in New Delhi, India. India's population is expected to be 1.7 billion by 2050. A staggering 97 percent of global growth over the next 40 years will happen in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the Population Reference Bureau's 2009 World Population Data Sheet. ""The great bulk of today's 1.2 billion youth -- nearly 90 percent -- are in developing countries,"" said Carl Haub, a co-author of the report. Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia. ""During the next few decades, these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities, gainful employment, and adequate health care,"" Haub continued, calling it one of the major social questions of the next few decades. In the developed world, the United States and Canada will account for most of the growth -- half from immigration and half from a natural increase in the population -- births minus deaths, according to the report. High fertility rates and a young population base in the developing world will fuel most of the growth, especially in Africa, where women often give birth to six or seven children over a lifetime, the report says. The number is about two in the United States and 1.5 in Canada. A stark contrast can be drawn between Uganda and Canada, which currently have about 34 million and 31 million residents, respectively. By 2050, Canada's population is projected to be 42 million, while Uganda's is expected to soar to 96 million, more than tripling. ""Even with declining fertility rates in many countries, world population is still growing at a rapid rate,"" said Bill Butz, president of the bureau. ""The increase from 6 billion to 7 billion is likely to take 12 years, as did the increase from 5 billion to 6 billion. Both events are unprecedented in world history."" By 2050, India is projected to be the world's most populous nation at 1.7 billion, overtaking current leader China, which is forecast to hit 1.4 billion.

201,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A birthday ""cake"" made of ice, beets, apples and pears? It might not sound appetizing, but it was a special treat Thursday for Tai Shan, the Smithsonian National Zoo's giant panda. Giant panda Tai Shan digs into his special birthday cake of ice, beets, apples and pears. A huge group of fans watched as the popular panda celebrated his fourth birthday with the three-tier cake. They cheered him on as he inched closer to the treat, and one woman yelled ""Atta boy Tai Shan!"" when he finally started eating the apple pieces on the cake's lowest tier. She cheered the panda on for eating his ""cake"" the same way a mom might cheer on her son at a soccer game or dad might cheer his daughter playing basketball. Zoo curator Lisa Stevens said people react that way because of how pandas resemble children. ""They share many features of infants and toddlers. They have high foreheads, big eye spots, and they can sit up straight and grip and eat their food,"" Stevens said. Pandas are also known to give hope to the downtrodden, according to one loyal Tai Shan fan who called herself ""Sandy.""

Giraffes are a common sight in Kruger National Park. KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (CNN) -- I spent two nights sleeping under a full-moon sky, nestled in my trusty hammock at Kruger National Park. Our guides provided us with tents, but I figured I wouldn't have too many opportunities in my life to slumber in the open bush on the African continent.

Needless to say, I survived, and it was magnificent.

However, Kruger National Park seemed to fit, quite perfectly, my idea of the African savannah. Arid and brown from the winter dry season, it was a forever-long expanse of low trees and dusty earth, the kind that somehow allows the early sun to reflect that perfect glow of stunning reds and oranges. Our guide was a self-proclaimed African bushman named Elson, who seemed to have an amazing one-ness with both the land and the animals. We'd be driving down one of the many nondescript dirt roads at a fairly fast pace, only to have him hit the brakes of our jeep, slam into reverse and point out a leopard 200 yards away. It would take the rest of us a fair bit of time to finally see what he noticed at a mere passing glance.

Of course, the rare lions and leopards pretty much just shaded themselves under distant trees, and the crocs swam silently through the bog. But they were there. And we were there. And it was beautiful. And just as soon as it began, our time in the South African bush was over. A couple of giraffes and elephants met us by the roadside to bid our group farewell as we drove out of the park. The preserve faded silently behind us, and the road ahead paved my way to Swaziland for a short stopover before continuing to the second part of this South African journey.",0.4937724,7663
204,"London (CNN) -- Debate is rife in Australian political circles about whether carbon trading is the way forward for climate change abatement. Carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is looking to introduce a mandatory carbon trading system by 2010 which will cap the amount of pollution industry can release. The proposed Australian system will be similar to the European Union emission trading system which was established in 2005. With Phase 1 of the European system complete, there are a few lessons about carbon trading that Australia -- and other countries looking to go down this path -- could benefit from. So what is carbon trading? Carbon trading -- also known as ""cap and trade"" -- is a system designed to cut the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming. Generally in a market-based cap and trade system, a central authority -- such as a government or international body -- sets a limit on the amount of carbon which can be emitted and then divides this amount into units which are allocated to different groups. These units can then be traded as any commodity would. Carbon trading can occur both between countries and amongst industries within countries. A second approach to carbon trading involves a country or business generating carbon credits by investing in ""green"" projects -- usually in developing countries -- that are said to reduce emissions. Why is it necessary? According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) there is unequivocal evidence that human activities have contributed to a gradual warming of the planet which has resulted in a change in climate. The IPCC report provides scientific evidence of change including to the duration of seasons, rainfall patterns and an increased frequency of extreme weather events. Industrialization is recognized as a key factor in the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere and according to the IPCC the world has warmed by an average of 0.74°C in the past 100 years. The IPCC predicts that if GHG emissions continue to rise at their current rate, this century will see a further 3°C rise in the average world temperature. While the consensus of the scientific community (via the IPCC) is that action must be taken to avert the worst impacts of climate change, economic arguments about the cost of climate change abatement -- advanced by countries like the U.S. and at one time Australia -- have in the past proved an impediment to action. A carbon trading system is said to be one way that countries can look to make greenhouse gas emissions cuts with minimal economic impact. Do you think carbon trading is the way to reduce greenhouse emissions? What trading systems exist? Established in 2005, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the largest multi-national, multi-sector CO2 trading system in the world. The ultimate aim of the system is to ensure that EU Member States are compliant with their Kyoto Protocol commitments and to do this the most energy-intensive industries are allocated carbon permits by Member States which allow them to emit a certain amount of CO2. If these companies want to emit more CO2 than their permits allow for, they are able to buy them from more efficient companies with spare permits. The EU ETS takes in around 12,000 installations which account for around 50 percent of EU greenhouse gas emissions from industries such as power, steel and cement manufacture. According the World Bank, the EU ETS contributed $50 billion of the $64 billion traded in the carbon market in 2007. The second largest carbon trading system exists under the United Nations Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol -- which sets binding emission targets for 37 industrialized countries -- permits emissions trading in order to help countries meet their agreed upon targets. Countries have agreed to an average 5 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions, compared to 1990 levels, by 2012 and carbon trading is one way to meet this quota. By December 2008, the EU ETS will link up with the UN trading system to create a more global scheme. The Clean Development Mechanism is a further carbon trading mechanism of the Protocol which allows industrialized nations to claim emission credits from investment in clean technologies which will ""offset"" carbon in developing countries. Developed nations can also finance emission reduction projects in developing countries through Joint Implementation in exchange for emission credits. New Zealand has established a mandatory carbon trading system this year and Australia has also committed to expanding the pioneering New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme to a national market by 2010. New mandatory systems are being considered for Japan and Canada. Voluntary carbon markets also exist, with the Chicago Climate Exchange one of the more established ones. What do permits cost? The cost of a carbon permit is dictated by the market forces of supply and demand. In 2007, one European Union Allocation (for one ton of carbon) was trading at $30 to $35. What industries are subject to trading? Under mandatory schemes like the EU ETS, it's the most energy-intensive industries within Member States which are subject to carbon trading. This includes industries like power installations, steel and cement manufacture and the construction industry. The commercial aviation industry -- which accounts for 3 percent of EU emissions -- could be brought into the EU ETS by 2011. Currently personal or household emissions and the public sector and transport industry emissions are not included in any carbon trading system. Has emissions trading been successful? Yes and no. The introduction of mandatory systems which cap emissions like the EU ETS is a step in the right direction for trying to cut emissions without a major cost to business. However, critics such as Carbon Trade Watch argue that the current carbon trade systems are flawed because there is a tendency for the biggest polluters to be over-allocated permits. This was clearly evident with Phase 1 of the EU ETS when the market virtually collapsed in 2006 because too many allowances were allocated. Market analyst Franck Schuttellaar estimated that the United Kingdom's most polluting companies made windfall profits of around $1.7 billion as a direct result of generous carbon credit allocation under the EU ETS. Questions have also been raised about whether carbon trading systems actually reduce GHG emissions. Independent UK think-tank Open Europe reported that between 2005 and 2006 emissions from industries covered by the ETS actually rose in UK by 3.6 percent and by 0.8 percent across the whole of Europe. Auctioning off carbon credits at the outset -- rather that simply allocating credits to business for free -- is one way that has been proposed to help the system make a real impact on emissions. Certainly, increasing the scarcity of carbon credits would help ensure that businesses commit to genuine low-carbon alternatives. While carbon emissions account for around 70 percent of greenhouse gases, they are not the sole cause of climate change and it would seem a safer bet to reinforce a carbon trading system with other legislative measures aimed at reducing emissions.",0.4924102,7962
205,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British authorities and environmental groups were welcoming the launch this week of the world's first biodegradable chewing gum, which they say could help save some of the millions spent on clearing up the mess ordinary gum creates. Manufacturers say the gum decomposes within six weeks. The new gum becomes non-adhesive when dry and decomposes to dust within six weeks, a spokesman for Mexico's Chicza Mayan Rainforest Chewing Gum told CNN. The makers of Chicza say it is the first biodegradable chewing gum ever sold. Environmental and waste management groups told CNN that they, too, believe it is a first. Unlike other gums that contain petrochemicals the natural gum is produced from the sap of the chicozapote tree found in the Mexican rainforest, a spokesman for Chicza told CNN. A spokesman for campaign group Keep Britain Tidy told CNN they welcome any product that can help eradicate the staining on pavements caused by dropped chewing gum. Removing chewing gum litter costs local authorities £150 million ($222 million) a year, a spokesman for the Local Government Association told CNN. Sixty-five percent of British streets have chewing gum stuck on them, a spokesman from Keep Britain Tidy told CNN. One of the worst-affected areas is Westminster in central London, where a comprehensive gum clean-up would cost £9 million ($13.4 million), according to Westminster City Council. ""Gum litter is a constant problem for us, especially given the vast number of visitors to Westminster every day. We spend £100,000 ($148,000) a year cleaning ugly blobs of conventional chewing gum off our streets,"" Westminster City Councilor Danny Chalkley said in a written statement. ""It's an incredibly expensive and time-consuming task, so anything that could reduce the problem is very welcome indeed."" he said. British parliamentarians have called on the government to introduce a tax on chewing gum, with the money raised going toward the cost of gum removal. In Britain, offenders can be fined up to £80 ($119) for discarding used chewing gum on a street. The producer of the new gum is Consorcio Chiclero, which comprises 46 cooperatives with around 2,000 chicleros farmers, working in an area of 1.3 million hectares of rainforest, according to a statement from Chicza. Locals have been extracting the natural chicle gum base from the bark of the chicozapote trees for a century, a spokesman for Chicza told CNN. After years of exporting the gum base to be used as an ingredient in the manufacture of regular chewing gum, the cooperative recently decided to start making its own gum using only chicle gum base and natural flavorings and sweeteners, Chicza said. The company launched its gum in Britain this week. It is available at a chain of supermarkets and Mexican restaurants. The Chicza gum sells for £1.39 ($2.06) for a pack of 12 squares.",0.49025977,4291
206,"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese scientists have produced clones of mice that have been dead and frozen for 16 years -- a feat that could lead researchers to one day resurrect long-extinct species, such as the mammoth. Dolly was cloned using cells from live animals. Now scientists believe they can resurrect extinct species. Until now, scientists have only been able to produce clones using cells from live animals. This is how researchers created Dolly the Sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult animal. Researchers had thought that frozen cells were unusable because ice crystals would have damaged the DNA. That belief would rule out the possibility of resurrecting extinct animals from their frozen remains. But the latest research -- published in the journal, Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences -- shows that scientists may have overcome the obstacle. Researchers at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, used cells from mice that had been frozen for 16 years at -20 Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit). They extracted the nucleus and injected it into eggs whose DNA had been removed. Several steps later, the scientists were able to clone the mice. ""This is the first time a mammal has been cloned from a sample stored at conditions reasonably close to what might be expected in permafrost,"" Teruhiko Wakayama, who led the study, said in a statement. ""(It) gives some hope for those who might seek to clone extinct species from frozen carcasses.""",0.48638403,1383
207,"(CNN) -- Billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens is sinking billions of dollars into a new wind farm in Texas. It is likely to become the biggest in the world, producing enough power for the equivalent of 1.3 million homes. CNN's Ali Velshi asked the oil legend why he thinks wind could be the answer to this country's energy problems: . T. Boone Pickens explains his investment in a 4,000-megawatt wind farm to CNN's Ali Velshi. Ali Velshi: Tell me about the wind. Now, you are buying, for a start, more than 600 wind turbines from General Electric. You're going to put them on this big tract of land in Texas, and you're going to generate a lot of electricity. What happens to that electricity? Tell me where you think you're going to make your money and how this is going to help the situation in America. T. Boone Pickens: Well, that's the first step to a 4,000-megawatt wind farm. This is 1,000 megawatts. We start receiving those turbines in mid 2010. We will have the total 4,000 megawatts finished by the end of 2015. That power will go into a transmission line that will tie into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system in the state of Texas, and it will be transmitted downstate.  Watch why Pickens is willing to spend billions on wind » . Velshi: What's your view of wind power? It's one of several things that we should be looking at in terms of powering our homes, electrical power? We get most of it from coal and natural gas, and some from nuclear. Are you thinking it's one of the formats of power we should be thinking about, or is this going to be bigger than we all thought? Pickens: The Department of Energy came out with a study in April of '07 that said we could generate 20 percent of our electricity from wind. And the wind power is -- you know, it's clean, it's renewable. It's -- you know, it's everything you want. And it's a stable supply of energy. It will be located in [the] central part of the United States, which will be the best from a safety standpoint to be located. You have a wind corridor that goes from Pampa, Texas, to the Canadian border. And it has -- the wind, it's unbelievable that we have not done more with wind. Look at Germany and Spain. They have developed their wind way beyond what we have, and they don't have as much wind as we do. It's not unlike the French have done with their nuclear. They're 80 percent power generated off of nuclear, we're 20 percent. Velshi: I'm fascinated by wind power. I love going by a field of these turbines. And I think they're fascinating. You don't happen to think they're attractive, and you're not really putting them on your land. You're going to be using other people's land to put these things on. Pickens: That's right. And it's very clear, these are my neighbors. And they want them. It generates income for them. A turbine will generate somewhere around 20,000 [dollars] a year in royalty income. And on a 640-acre tract, you can put five to 10 of these on the tract. And you don't have to have them if you don't want them. Velshi: And it's quite common that people who maybe have a piece of land, they might be farmers or something like that, this is extra income to them by making a deal with somebody like you who is going put these things up, if they don't mind having them on the land. Do they get the electricity from it or do they just get a royalty check? Pickens: A royalty check. But look at Sweetwater, Texas. That town was 12,000 people, then went down below 10,000. The wind came in, it's above 12,000 in population now. The local economy is booming. That can be repeated over and over and over again all the way to the Canadian border. Then you have a solar corridor that goes from Sweetwater, Texas, west to the West coast, and that solar corridor can also be developed. But we are going to have to do something different in America. You can't keep paying out $600 billion a year for oil.",0.47336993,5204
208,"(CNN)  -- Here's a tip for dairy farmers: If you want your cows to produce more milk, get to know them better. Herdsman Paul Nelson of Eachwick Red House Farm, Newcastle, England, with Highlight the cow. So says a study out of Newcastle University in northeast England, published online Wednesday in the academic journal Anthrozoos. The researchers found that farmers who named their cows Betsy or Gertrude or Daisy improved their overall milk yield by almost 500 pints (284 liters) annually. ""Just as people respond better to the personal touch, cows also feel happier and more relaxed if they are given a bit more one-to-one attention,"" Catherine Douglas of the university's School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development said in a news release. ""By placing more importance on the individual, such as calling a cow by her name or interacting with the animal more as it grows up, we can not only improve the animal's welfare and her perception of humans, but also increase milk production."" Douglas and her colleagues questioned 516 dairy farmers in the United Kingdom. Almost half said they called the cows on their farms by name and reported a higher milk yield. A press statement from the university, touting the study, quoted Dennis Gibb, who co-owns a dairy farm outside of Newcastle, called Eachwick Red House Farm. ""We love our cows here at Eachwick, and every one of them has a name,"" Gibb said. ""Collectively, we refer to them as 'our ladies,' but we know every one of them and each one has her own personality.""",0.46905014,1702
209,"During CNN's ""Going Green: Green Light for Business"" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. First up is the co-founder of Hong Kong-based DIAZ Fine Jewelry, Salina Khan Fuchigami, whose business packages cubic zirconia diamonds in an environmental wrapping. Growing up surrounded by generations of jewelry wearing tradition, I was drawn to the brilliance and transparency of diamonds from an early age. Later, it was the fact that diamonds are a unique resource, evoking beauty and eternal love that lead me to found DIAZ Fine Jewelry. Salina Khan Fuchigami co-founded DIAZ Fine Jewelry with her husband Takashi. However, as I began to learn beyond the basics and beauty of diamonds, I began to discover the many environmental and ethical issues related to them. And the once simple wish to create a line of exquisite diamond jewelry grew into a mission -- to create an ecologically and ethically correct jewelry brand. I was one of many who were understandably concerned to learn that jewelry they had as a symbol of love may have come at a terrible human and environmental cost. Although the social and ethical issues associated with conflict diamonds were the impetus at the core of the DIAZ philosophy, the serious environmental impacts of the diamond industry could not be ignored. There's an undeniable link between the degradation of our global environment and consumer culture. The trouble is that these days, things are so nicely packaged, presented and displayed that we hardly ever question how the raw materials used to produce the goods are extracted and processed. We rarely think of how it all affects the environment and humankind. It's impossible to assess exactly how much devastation one single diamond could have caused before it was cut, polished, set and sold at a high-end retailer. It's hard to imagine what a diamond mine looks like by looking at the ""stunning sparklers"" that are neatly displayed in shop windows. Somewhere along the way it became irrelevant to question the true cost of the stones. Diamond mining practices are not without huge ecological impacts. Whether extracted from a large-scale diamond mine using modern, clinical mining methods, or through small-scale artisanal alluvial diamond digging, the diamond industry faces environmental challenges just as with any mineral extraction. Land disturbance, which involves the shifting of large quantities of soil from the earth, is interlinked with issues of waste and water pollution as well as huge impacts on biodiversity. Through my company, I knew I could offer an alternative to mined-diamond jewelry of equal beauty and quality -- using lab-created jewels and meticulous craftsmanship -- jewelry that evoked beauty and eternal love, and that was truly transparent. As with any environmental or ethical issue, education, knowledge and action are the keys to ending unnecessary harm. So, as the business grew, we made sure each of our customers received an info-leaflet with every purchase. We began donating proceeds from our sales to grassroots organizations that ran mine-reclamation projects promoting organic farming and biodiversity in mining towns in Sierra Leone, a country devastated by civil war that was fueled by diamonds and now has a landscape scarred by indiscriminate alluvial diamond mining. We began monitoring the working conditions at our workshop, and looking for more sustainable methods of packaging and delivering our jewelry. We found that our customers were happy to be a part of a solution and not the problem. The economic downturn, combined with an increasing awareness of the ecological and ethical facts surrounding diamonds, has meant an increase in customers who appreciate affordable luxury without any attached guilt. There's no doubt that the choices we make and the actions we take today affect the fate of our planet and in turn our well being. With shifting consumer behavior and a changing economic and environmental climate, the time has come where being environmentally conscious is an imperative for all individuals and businesses alike.",0.4564451,7392
210,"(CNN) -- Going to the beach has become a lot like looking for hotel accommodations: If it has a one-star ranking, you know you're in for nothing but trouble. A new report released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council ranked the water quality of 200 U.S. coastal beaches using a five-star guide, and the results are far from a day at the beach. Laguna Beach in Orange County, California, is one of the NRDC's five-star beaches for water quality. ""Nationwide, 7 percent of beach water samples are so contaminated with human or animal waste that they're not conducive for swimming,"" said Nancy Stoner, co-director of the NRDC's water program and lead author for the report. ""For the fourth year in a row, NRDC found that there were more than 20,000 beach closings last year because of human or animal waste in the water."" Pollutants found in beach water are frequently the result of storm water or sewage overflow, and it's not something to take lightly, especially if small children, pregnant women or the elderly are spending time in the surf. Swimming in polluted water can lead to ear infections and stomach viruses, as well as more serious diseases like meningitis and hepatitis, Stoner said. The Environmental Protection Agency sets a standard for beach water quality, and when water quality tests reveal that pollution has exceeded that standard, the beach is closed. ""The problem,"" Stoner said, ""is that it does take 24 hours or longer to produce test results,"" meaning if the beach was contaminated on Thursday, you won't know about it until Friday. And once those results are produced, there's no guarantee that the cause is identifiable. While storm water and sewage are often the culprit for closures, for 62 percent of the 20,000 beach closures that occurred last year, the cause of the pollution was unknown. But with precious few weeks of beach season left, now is not the time to avoid sand and surf like the plague. Thankfully, not all beaches are polluted equally -- the NRDC hands out five stars to beaches that meet health standards more than 95 per cent of the time and quickly notify beach goers with signs and Internet alerts when there's a potential problem. Standout states include Delaware, New Hampshire and Virginia, which boast having pristine, nearly pollution-free shores. Virginians however should take note: Fairview Beach in King George County is certainly not one of those. According to Stoner, this beach is considered to be one of the worst offenders, particularly because it consistently fails more than 25 percent of its water quality tests. Hands down, one of the best beaches is Ocean City, Maryland, which does well year after year because of its clean water and strict water quality monitoring, two factors that earned the popular East Coast beach five stars. In nearby Delaware, Dewey and Bethany beaches also earned a stamp of approval from the NRDC. Newport Beach and Laguna Beach are two of California's five-star beaches, but stay away from Doheny Beach and Avalon Beach, which both failed more than 25 percent of their water quality tests in 2008. If you're in the Great Lakes region and looking for quality beach time, strongly consider booking a trip to one of the coasts. ""From 2005 to 2008, the Great Lakes consistently tested the dirtiest. In 2008, 13 percent of beach water samples violated public health standards,"" Stoner said. But no matter which beach you frequent, five-star or not, you should always take precautions by avoiding beaches with obvious sources of pollution, like nearby open pipes and trash. Wait at least 24 hours after a heavy rain before hitting the waves again, allowing potential pollutants to dissipate.

212,"(CNN) -- Just as ""Y2K"" and its batch of predictions about the year 2000 have become a distant memory, here comes ""Twenty-twelve."" The sun shines through the door of the Seven Dolls Temple, in the Maya ruins of Dzibilchaltun in Mexico. Fueled by a crop of books, Web sites with countdown clocks, and claims about ancient timekeepers, interest is growing in what some see as the dawn of a new era, and others as an expiration date for Earth: December 21, 2012. The date marks the end of a 5,126-year cycle on the Long Count calendar developed by the Maya, the ancient civilization known for its advanced understanding of astronomy and for the great cities it left behind in Mexico and Central America. (Some scholars believe the cycle ends a bit later -- on December 23, 2012.) Speculation in some circles about whether the Maya chose this particular time because they thought something ominous would happen has sparked a number of doomsday theories. The hype also has mainstream Maya scholars shaking their heads. ""There's going to be a whole generation of people who, when they think of the Maya, think of 2012, and to me that's just criminal,"" said David Stuart, director of the Mesoamerica Center at the University of Texas at Austin. ""There is no serious scholar who puts any stock in the idea that the Maya said anything meaningful about 2012.""  Find out more about the history and culture of the Maya » . But take the fact that December 21, 2012, coincides with the winter solstice, add claims the Maya picked the time period because it also marks an alignment of the sun with the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and you have the makings of an online sensation. Type ""2012"" into an Internet search engine and you'll find survival guides, survival schools, predictions and ""official stuff"" to wear, including T-shirts with slogans such as ""2012 The End"" and ""Doomsday 2012."" Theories about what might happen range from solar storms triggering volcano eruptions to a polar reversal that will make the Earth spin in the opposite direction. If you think all of this would make a great sci-fi disaster movie, Hollywood is already one step ahead. ""2012,"" a special-effects flick starring John Cusack and directed by Roland Emmerich, of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" fame, is scheduled to be released this fall. The trailer shows a monk running to a bell tower on a mountaintop to sound the alarm as a huge wall of water washes over what appear to be the peaks of the Himalayas. 'Promoting a hoax' One barometer of the interest in 2012 may be the ""Ask an Astrobiologist"" section of NASA's Web site, where senior scientist David Morrison answers questions from the public. On a recent visit, more than half of the inquiries on the most popular list were related to 2012. ""The purveyors of doom are promoting a hoax,"" Morrison wrote earlier this month in response to a question from a person who expressed fear about the date. A scholar who has studied the Maya for 35 years said there is nothing ominous about 2012, despite the hype surrounding claims to the contrary. ""I think that the popular books... about what the Maya say is going to happen are really fabricated on the basis of very little evidence,"" said Anthony Aveni, a professor of astronomy, anthropology and Native American studies at Colgate University. Aveni and Stuart are both writing their own books explaining the Mayan calendar and 2012, but Stuart said he's pessimistic that people will be interested in the real story when so many other books are making sensational claims. Dozens of titles about 2012 have been published and more are scheduled to go on sale in the coming months. Current offerings include ""Apocalypse 2012,"" in which author Lawrence Joseph outlines ""terrible possibilities,"" such as the potential for natural disaster. But Joseph admits he doesn't think the world is going to end. ""I do, however, believe that 2012 will prove to be... a very dramatic and probably transformative year,"" Joseph said. The author acknowledged he's worried his book's title might scare people, but said he wanted to alert the public about possible dangers ahead. He added that his publisher controls the book's title, though he had no issue with the final choice. ""If it had been called 'Serious Threats 2012' or 'Profound Considerations for 2012,' it would have never gotten published,"" Joseph said. Growing interest . Another author said the doom and gloom approach is a great misunderstanding of 2012. ""The trendy doomsday people... should be treated for what they are: under-informed opportunists and alarmists who will move onto other things in 2013,"" said John Major Jenkins, whose books include ""Galactic Alignment"" and who describes himself as a self-taught independent Maya scholar. Jenkins said that cycle endings were all about transformation and renewal -- not catastrophe -- for the Maya. He also makes the case that the period they chose coincides with an alignment of the December solstice sun with the center of the Milky Way, as viewed from Earth. ""Two thousand years ago the Maya believed that the world would be going through a great transformation when this alignment happened,"" Jenkins said. But Aveni said there is no evidence that the Maya cared about this concept of the Milky Way, adding that the galactic center was not defined until the 1950s. ""What you have here is a modern age influence [and] modern concepts trying to garb the ancient Maya in modern clothing, and it just doesn't wash for me,"" Aveni said. Meanwhile, he and other scholars are bracing for growing interest as the date approaches. ""The whole year leading up to it is going to be just crazy, I'm sorry to say,"" Stuart said. ""I just think it's sad, it really just frustrates me. People are really misunderstanding this really cool culture by focusing on this 2012 thing. It means more about us than it does about the Maya.""",0.43194193,2615
213,"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Puzzled zookeepers in northern Japan have discovered the reason why their attempts to mate two polar bears kept failing: Both are female. A 4-year-old polar bear sent to impregnate a female polar bear at a zoo in Kushiro was found to be female as well. The municipal zoo in the city of Kushiro in Hokkaido brought in a polar bear cub three years ago. They named it Tsuyoshi, after the popular baseball outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo, and waited until it reached reproductive age. In June, the zoo introduced Tsuyoshi to its resident bear, an 11-year-old female named Kurumi, and waited for sparks to fly. But much to the disappointment of zookeepers, Tsuyoshi never made any amorous advances toward Kurumi. Earlier this month, zookeepers put Tsuyoshi under anesthesia to get to the bottom of the matter. That's when they made their discovery: Tsuyoshi is a female. Still, the Kushiro zoo plans to keep Tsuyoshi because he -- or rather, she -- has become immensely popular with visitors. ""I have rather mixed feelings, given the need for breeding, but Tsuyoshi is an idol for Kushiro,"" Yoshio Yamaguchi, head of the Kushiro zoo, told Japan's Kyodo news agency. Tsuyoshi will even keep her name. ""We will not be changing it to 'Tsuyoko' since it is loved by citizens (by the current name),"" Yamaguchi said. ""Ko"" is a common suffix for a Japanese female name. Meanwhile, Tsuyoshi's ""brother,"" who was adopted by another zoo, has also turned out to be female, Kyodo reported. -- CNN's Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report .",0.42903364,4862
214,"(CNN) -- English contains more words than any other language on the planet and added its millionth word early Wednesday, according to the Global Language Monitor, a Web site that uses a math formula to estimate how often words are created. The Global Language Monitor says the millionth word was added to English on Wednesday. The site estimates the millionth English word, ""Web 2.0"" was added to the language Wednesday at 5:22 a.m. ET. The term refers to the second, more social generation of the Internet. The site says more than 14 words are added to English every day, at the current rate. The ""Million Word March,"" however, has made the man who runs this word-counting project somewhat of a pariah in the linguistic community. Some linguists say it's impossible to count the number of words in a language because languages are always changing, and because defining what counts as a word is a fruitless endeavor. Paul J.J. Payack, president and chief word analyst for the Global Language Monitor, says, however, that the million-word estimation isn't as important as the idea behind his project, which is to show that English has become a complex, global language. ""It's a people's language,"" he said. Other languages, like French, Payack said, put big walls around their vocabularies. English brings others in. ""English has the tradition of swallowing new words whole,"" he said. ""Other languages translate."" The Internet, global commerce and global travel have accelerated the trend by putting English in contact with many other linguistic groups. This has made English more rich and more complex -- hence all of the new terms, he said. Still, Payack says he doesn't include all new words in his count. Words must make sense in at least 60 percent of the world to be official, he said. And they must make sense to different communities of people. A new technology term that's only understood in Silicon Valley wouldn't count as a mainstream word, he said. His computer models check billions of Web sites -- including the Global Top 5,000 media sites -- dictionaries, scholarly publications and news articles to see how frequently words are used, he said. A word must make 25,000 appearances to be deemed legitimate.  Learn about how other languages stack up » . Payack said news events have also fueled the rapid expansion of English, which he said has more words than any other language. Mandarin Chinese comes in second with about 450,000 words, he said. English terms like ""Obamamania,"" ""defriend,"" ""wardrobe malfunction,"" ""zombie banks,"" ""shovel ready"" and ""recessionista"" all have grown out of recent news cycles about the presidential election, economic crash, online networking or a sports event, he said. Other languages might not have developed new terms to deal with such phenomena, he said. Language experts who spoke with CNN said they disapprove of Payack's count, but they agree that English generally has more words than most, if not all, languages. ""This is stuff that you just can't count,"" said Jesse Sheidlower, editor at large of the Oxford English Dictionary. ""No one can count it, and to pretend that you can is totally disingenuous. It simply can't be done."" The Oxford English Dictionary has about 600,000 entries, Sheidlower said. But that by no means includes all words, he said. For example, Sheidlower said ""great-great-great-great grandfather"" could be considered a word, but wouldn't be in the dictionary. There's a similar problem with numbers, which may be counted up by their pieces -- ""twenty"" and ""three"" -- but not always as a group, as in ""two-hundred twenty-three."" Part of what makes determining the number of words in a language so difficult is that there are so many root words and their variants, said Sarah Thomason, president of the Linguistic Society of America and a linguistics professor at the University of Michigan. In the language of native Alaskans, she said, there are dozens of words for snow, but many of them are linked together and wouldn't be counted individually. Does that mean, she asked, that ""slush,"" ""powder"" and other snow words in English should be counted as one entry? Thomason called the million-word count a ""sexy idea"" that is ""all hype and no substance."" Linguists and lexicographers run into further complications when trying to count words that are spelled one way but can have several meanings, said Allan Metcalf, an English professor at MacMurray College in Illinois, and an officer at the American Dialect Society. ""The word bear, b-e-a-r -- is that two words or one, for example? You have a noun that's a wild creature and then you have b-e-a-r, [which means] to bear left or to bear right, and there's many other things,"" he said. ""So you really can't be exact about a millionth word."" Payack said he doesn't consider his to be the definitive count, just an interesting estimation based on set criteria he has helped develop. ""It's always an estimation,"" he said. ""It's like the height of Mount Everest is an estimation. The height of Mount Everest has changed five times in my lifetime because as we get better tools, the estimates get better."" He said the count is meant to be a celebration of English as a global language. And, while he says other languages are being stamped out by English's expansion, it's a powerful thing that so many people today are able to communicate with such a vast list of words.",0.42596847,7220
215,"(CNN) -- No drawn butter will ever touch Fiona's tail. She's an extremely rare, seven-year-old ""yellow"" lobster. Fiona's colorful hue makes her a one-in-30 million rarity. Fiona belongs to Nathan Nickerson, the owner of Arnold's Lobster and Clam Bar in Eastham, Massachusetts, who has been in the restaurant business for 32 years. The special lobster was caught off the coast of eastern Canada last week by a friend of Nickerson. ""In 57 years in Cape Cod, I have never seen a yellow lobster and I doubt that I will ever see one again,"" he said Thursday. Experts say Fiona's colorful appearance makes her one in 30 million. Fiona's not really yellow, but more of a bright orange, She's not quite the red color your typical lobster looks after it's been cooked. Nickerson has plans for his new ocean-dwelling friend, but it has nothing to do with the boiling pot.

216,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- What to do with 50,000 used, possibly smelly and dirty prison mattresses that need to be disposed of every year? Discarded mattresses  pile up alongside trash in London in January of this year. Britain's Prison Service won praise Thursday for its innovative solution to the problem: recycle the mattresses for carpet underlay, or break them down for fencing or even roof tiles. Most of the mattresses are sent to landfills. There are enough of them each year to fill 30 double-decker buses, the National Audit Office said Thursday. The Prison Service wanted to find a better way to dispose of the mattresses -- a ""zero-waste"" solution that also cost less money, the NAO said. It worked with suppliers and launched a competition to find the best solution. They ended up coming up with several proposals to reuse the mattresses, and the Prison Service is now testing them out, the NAO said. Thursday's report highlighted several other examples of ways that government departments have used innovation to their advantage. ""We have selected them as good examples of innovative approaches which have lessons for how innovation can be managed in government,"" the report said.",0.40793067,4442
217,"(This Old House) -- Unless you're a perfect caretaker of your lawn (and, really, who is?), prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer. You'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions, of course. And an attack from the crabgrass. But you'll face more stealthy opponents, too: root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown. ""If a lawn is neglected, or cared for in a hit-or-miss way, it gets weak,"" says This Old House landscape contractor Roger Cook. ""And that's when weeds, insects, or fungal diseases become a major problem."" Little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders. But as in most battles, the best defense is a strong offense: doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf. That means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height (ask your local garden center what's best where you live); and fertilizing in spring and fall. So promise yourself -- and your turf -- you'll do that this year. In the meantime, here's how to conquer the most common turf problems you're likely to confront this summer. Fungal disease . Symptoms: Circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass; or blades with tiny red threads. Culprits: Powdery mildew, brown patch, dollar spot, and fusarium patch; or red thread. These fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf. Solutions: Though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection, if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard, look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions. For an organic fix, search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi. Then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits: Avoid excessive shade (prune back trees and large shrubs, if necessary) and too many applications of fertilizer, herbicides, or pesticides. Carefully monitor your turf's moisture intake and never water in the evening. Weeds . Symptoms: Fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass. This Old House: What type of grass is right for your yard . Culprits: Crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion, purslane, henbit, and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass hasn't completely taken root. To check for compacted soil, stick a screwdriver into the ground; it should slide in easily. Solutions: The first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders. The best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe. This will also loosen the soil in affected areas. Or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot-treat an infestation. If weeds are too plentiful to be pulled, check your garden center for a ""weed-and-feed"" blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area, or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten. Be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly, as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24-hour breather with no foot traffic. From here on out, mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly, and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods. Water well as the summer heats up, and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds. In the fall, open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard, or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn. You may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring. Insects . Symptoms: Brown turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat. Culprits: White grubs, a catch-all name for root-chomping beetle larvae, including june bugs, Japanese beetles, and masked chafers. To be sure that's what you've got, cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back, looking for pale, half-inch- to inch-long C-shaped bugs. If you find more than six, treat the turf. This Old House:  Meet the good bugs . Solutions: Grubs are the biggest threat to lawns, and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective. For an organic fix, spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes-microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they're present. With nematodes, timing the application with their life cycle is critical, so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly. Both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online (gardensalive.com). Symptoms: Irregular-shaped patches of brownish-yellow grass. Culprits: Chinch bugs, gray-black, quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack St. Augustine and zoysia grasses in the South and Kentucky bluegrass in the North. To spot them, bury an empty coffee can, with both ends removed, at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water. The bugs will seek out the moisture, then float to the top. If you see more than 10 after 20 minutes, you should address the problem. Solutions: Chinch bugs live on the surface, among thatch, so dethatching will reduce their numbers. To eradicate them completely, look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient. Longer-term, overseed with chinch-bug-resistant grasses. Symptoms: Patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base. Culprits: Sod webworms and tropical sod webworms, hairless cream-to-gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small, buff-colored moths at maturity. The tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm. To check for webworms, mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water; pour it over the infested turf. Any larvae will float to the top. Solutions: You can try flooding your lawn to drown them. Or choose an appropriate insecticide; in an organic product, look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad. With extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix. TIP: If dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn, keep a hose or water bucket nearby. Dog urine is high in nitrogen, which can ""burn"" turf, creating a good-sized yellow patch. The best fix is immediate action: Flush the area ASAP with water to dilute it. Once badly burned, grass won't come back on its own-you'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed.
