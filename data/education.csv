0,"NEW YORK -- Talking excitedly and pacing the front of her classroom, Molly Greer engages her students. ""What are different paces you can go when you're reading aloud? Christina?"" Molly Greer, in her New York classroom, says she now wants to make teaching her career. ""Low."" ""Okay, low or soft, yes."" On the first day of school, most of the kids in Greer's eighth-grade class could not read at a sixth-grade level. With summer almost here, it's a totally different story for these kids, who according to their school are expected to read at or near grade level. ""It is an incredible thing for these students."" Greer graduated with honors from the University of Wisconsin. She arrived at PS 212, the multicultural magnet school in the Bronx, New York, two years ago with a degree in political science and a desire to change the world. ""When I found out about Teach For America,"" she said, ""I realized that teaching would be such an incredible way to make an impact."" Teach For America is like a local Peace Corps serving some of the country's poorest public schools in inner cities and in rural areas. It has grown every year since its inception in 1990, sending 20,000 college graduates into the nation's neediest classrooms for a two-year commitment. This year, amid a tight job market, it is more popular than ever. According to the organization's Web site, their teachers get paid the same salary and benefits as beginning teachers in their area and are paid by the local school district. About 35,000 college seniors applied for the 2009 school year, a 42 percent jump from last year. ""We had less competition from Wall Street firms, banks and places like that. It just led a lot of students to really think about what they wanted to do and how they could make an impact,"" said Kevin Huffman, executive director of Teach For America. ""Eleven percent of the entire Ivy League senior class applied to join, 20 percent of African-American seniors at Ivy League schools, 8 percent of the University of Michigan and University of North Carolina,"" Huffman said, ""just an incredible outpouring of interest by people competing to teach in low-income communities."" David Stanley went through the program and now recruits for Teach For America. He sees education as this generation's civil rights issue and says there is a direct correlation between the program's popularity and President Obama's call to service. ""With Obama talking about the need for people with talent to go into public education, and the fact that people are still really frustrated that we live in a country where 90 percent of kids in low-income communities don't go to college, and that the best way we can predict the number of prisons we're going to have to build in 25 years is by looking at third-grade reading skills, and so at this particular moment in time, I think it's really about getting our very best and asking them to go to the root of the problem, and the root of the problem is education."" This year, Teach For America will place its largest corps ever. About 4,100 high achievers from the nation's top colleges will head to classrooms in 34 regions across the country, teaching in places like Boston, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Nashville, Tennessee; and in more rural areas such as South Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta. But schools in Appalachia and elsewhere desperately need help. Huffman said, ""Districts across the country are facing the same economic pinch that many businesses are facing. And there are just fewer positions across the country available for teachers."" Which is why a teachers union says those positions should go to career teachers, not inexperienced recruits who may stay only the required two years. ""It's very hard to justify laying off teachers who have given service to a school system and then turn around and bring in new teachers,"" argued John Wilson of the National Education Association, the nation's largest professional employee organization for the advancement of public education. Besides the matter of taking away potential jobs from career teachers, unions question whether these young recruits have the right credentials and experience to handle tough classrooms. ""When you're assigning these teachers to the highest poverty schools, the most challenging schools, these children need the most experienced, the most prepared teachers, and they're not getting them,"" Wilson said, ""and that's quite a disadvantage."" Teach For America maintains that its members go through a rigorous five-week training camp and that while on the job, many pursue a teaching certificate or master's degree in education. New York will be taking 330 corps members into its schools this year. Vicki Bernstein, who is in charge of teacher recruitment and quality for the city's Department of Education, says teachers coming in through alternative programs, like Teach For America, perform as well as teachers from traditional routes. ""They serve some of our highest-need children, both in terms of neighborhoods that we have difficulty attracting traditionally prepared teachers and in subject areas where we have difficulty, that teacher colleges are not preparing teachers in those areas."" The organization says two-thirds of its recruits stay in academics, like Greer, who now plans on teaching as a career. She says her experience in the classroom has been incredibly rewarding. ""When the kid makes the two years of reading growth and they have the biggest smile on their face because they achieved their goal through their own hard work,"" she said, ""that feeling that I contributed to that student is the best compliment I can get, because I know that kid is in a better place to succeed in their future.""",0.83109856,4131
1,"Central Falls, Rhode Island (CNN) -- Graduates of the nation's most vilified high school descended upon campus Tuesday evening to support the school's fired teachers. They also had a message for President Obama: Don't bash our school. ""He doesn't know us. He doesn't know the teachers. He doesn't know the students,"" said Nikko Calle, 21, a graduate of Central Falls High School in 2006. ""I think it's a real outrage what's happening here."" Nearby, Ashley Delgado, 19, stood on the school's steps clutching a sign that read: ""Dear Obama, I supported you, your causes, goals and beliefs. Why aren't you supporting mine?"" A firestorm has erupted in this Democratic stronghold in recent weeks after 93 teachers, support staff and administrators at Central Falls High School were fired for the low performance of the school, which graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year. The firings will go into effect at the end of the school year. Teachers can re-apply, but no more than 50 percent will get rehired. Obama weighed in last week, endorsing the actions of the local board. ""Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right,"" the president said. Obama's comments further inflamed an already tense environment in this poor Rhode Island enclave, just outside Providence. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Delgado, who graduated in 2008. ""Ever since the beginning, I thought firing all the teachers was a ridiculous notion."" About 70 young people, most of them graduates of the school and now in college or working, demonstrated peacefully outside the school in the largely Hispanic, working class neighborhood. They expressed outrage and disbelief that the school they attended has become a national pariah. ""We stand together for our teachers and for our school,"" said Katherine Lopera, 20, a graduate in 2007. Her classmate, Sindy Alvisures, said, ""The teachers are literally like our family. When I went through high school, I went through a lot of personal problems and my teachers were always there for me."" Of the 800 students who currently attend Central Falls, 65 percent are Hispanic; English is a second language for most. Half the students are failing every subject, with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math, officials say. The defenders of the school say improvements have been made, but the stats are skewed against them because the school's population is so transient. Tuesday's demonstration was to coincide with a board of trustees meeting, where the firings were to be the main topic. However, the meeting was abruptly called off, because the Governor's Commission on Disabilities said the school's auditorium was unfit for people with disabilities. On the steps outside the school, George McLaughlin shrugged. He cast suspicion on the reason for the meeting's cancellation. ""Unless they mean, it's not fit for morally disabled people,"" he said. McLaughlin has been a guidance counselor at Central Falls for the last 15 years. His wife is a chemistry teacher. ""We will lose all of our income."" He suggested Obama should summon the 93 teachers and administrators for a beer summit. The president ""hasn't heard our side of the story,"" said McLaughlin, a member of the teachers' union. ""He hasn't listened to us. He knows nothing about us."" Marcia Reback, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, was less hospitable toward the president. ""We're all taking our bumper stickers for Obama off our cars,"" Reback said earlier in the day. She said the union supports school reform. She called for an independent mediator to intervene at Central Falls because tensions have gotten so high between the union and the school administrators who carried out the firings. ""This is unprecedented,"" Reback said. ""I don't think anyone was prepared for this kind of fallout."" School superintendent Fran Gallo said she stands by her decision. She noted the school didn't graduate half its seniors last year. ""Somebody hasn't spoken up for them, the other 50 percent,"" she said. As darkness fell at the school, the graduates who had come back said the problems at the school have been oversimplified and that the rest of the nation can't understand the importance of the teachers in the tough environment they live. Nikko Calle said one of the most important men in his life was his creative writing teacher, Michael Occhi. A freshly planted tree stands on the school's lawn to honor the legacy of Occhi. He was killed in an accident by a drunk driver last summer. Encouraged by his high school teacher, Calle has taken up poetry. ""A lot of these teachers here helped me through hard times,"" he said. ""They were always here for me."" Now, many here wonder what the legacy of the school will be next.",0.8146212,8770
2,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Michelle Rhee says she runs at 100 miles per hour. As the chancellor of one of the nation's lowest-performing school districts, she says she has no choice -- too much bureaucracy to cut through, too many problems to fix after decades of neglect. Michelle Rhee says a sense of urgency has been missing for years in the District of Columbia's schools. Rhee closed 23 schools in her first year as the head of the District of Columbia's public schools, fired 36 principals and cut 15 percent -- about 121 jobs -- from the central office staff. And she's making no apologies. ""I think it's that sense of urgency that has been lacking for far too long in our public schools,"" Rhee told CNN as she began her second year on the job in late August. ""We are always going to put the best interests of kids above the rights, privileges and priorities of adults.""  Watch fighting for ""radical changes"" » . Rhee said ""radical"" changes are needed because only 12 percent of the District's eighth graders are proficient in reading and just 8 percent are proficient in math, but was quick to add that they're already seeing improvement. She highlighted gains in elementary reading and secondary level math and reading in the past year that outstripped all of the four prior years put together. An annual report card by Education Week, a newspaper that follows the nation's education system, earlier this year ranked the District's school system last, giving it a D+ overall and an F for student achievement in kindergarten through 12th grade. Those grades were based on data prior to Rhee's arrival. ""We need to see radical changes because the outcomes for kids that are happening right now are robbing them of their futures,"" said Rhee, a Democrat who supports President Bush's landmark education law known as No Child Left Behind.  Watch Rhee describe telling employee: ""You need to find another job"" » . ""We have scores of kids in this city who don't have the advocates that they need in their lives who are able to maneuver and jockey through the public school system. And we can't allow those children to languish in classrooms where teachers are not performing."" Her plan is ambitious: To completely transform the District's system within eight years for its 50,000 children. The plan focuses on top-down accountability, quantitative results like standardized test scores and, ultimately, working to close what she describes as ""the achievement gap between wealthy white kids and poor minority kids."" ""I think it's absolutely possible within an eight-year period,"" she said.  Watch D.C. schools need ""urgency"" » . Rhee, who is Korean-American, is operating in a largely African-American district. It is a district where 57 percent of the students qualify for the free or reduced lunch program. Rhee said when she first arrived on the job in 2007 she first heard whispers of: ""She's not from D.C., she's not African-American: Is she going to be able to relate to students and their families?"" ""I think that all dissipated quite quickly after I started getting out into the community and talking to people,"" said Rhee, a 38-year-old mother of two children attending local public schools. ""I think one of the things that comes across very clearly is the fact that I'm very passionate about this work. I'm very focused on it."" But her plan to turn the failing school district on its head has met protest every step of the way, even from teachers. ""I think the people who view her aggressive actions as a positive thing, I think they are missing the boat because if it results in more chaos and more dysfunction, it's not the solution that we need,"" said Kerry Sylvia, a teacher at Cardozo Senior High School in her ninth year. Sylvia says the District has seen far too many superintendents over the years and fears Rhee is just another in the long list of those who come in touting their reforms and then leave. She does offer praise for Rhee holding teachers and administrators accountable for their lack of performance. However, she doesn't always care for Rhee's style, saying Rhee makes it seem like ""there's a lot of lazy teachers."" ""She's pitting adults against children. She couches things in terms of 'I'm not here to keep jobs for adults. I'm not here to keep people's paychecks. I am here for the children,' "" Sylvia said. ""Well, guess what? I'm here for the children too."" Before taking on her current role, Rhee founded The New Teacher Project, a non-profit organization that recruits quality teachers to high-poverty schools. Rhee holds a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University. One of the most controversial programs Rhee has introduced is a joint venture between D.C. schools and Harvard that pays middle school students cash -- up to $100 a month -- for good behavior and attendance. Rhee says such pilot programs have worked in other cities. She says the District's students have far too many bad incentives on the streets, from hustling to drug dealing, and need something to keep them focused. ""We're preparing them to understand that if you do the right thing, then good things will happen to you,"" Rhee said. Some in the District are skeptical, including Clarence Cherry, a fourth-generation Washingtonian and father of five. He calls the cash and Rhee's overall direction misguided and reckless. ""It's a very dangerous game that she's playing with,"" he said. But Cherry added, ""I want to give her an opportunity to prove to me as a parent that she genuinely ... is here for the kids."" Others are fervent supporters of the new superintendent. Dr. Waheedah Shakoor, another teacher at Cardozo, has been in the District since 1979. He says he's been stunned at the amount of change that's happened in just one year under Rhee, from freshly painted walls to improved athletic facilities. ""Things that we've been asking for for many, many years have come to fruition within just the last 12 months,"" Shakoor said. Rhee is an appointee of Mayor Adrian Fenty, who has backed her every move. ""I had the highest expectations of Michelle Rhee when she came into the job. She has exceeded every expectation,"" Fenty said. ""When you have a system that's been as underperforming as the District of Columbia public schools, you need to shake things up."" Rhee says she'll continue to shake things, working at break-neck speed to improve the education and opportunity for her students and urban students across the country as fast as she can.",0.7814602,1045
3,"(CNN) -- The Rhode Island school superintendent who last week fired all the teachers and staff from a school whose students were performing poorly said Wednesday she is willing to negotiate now that the union has agreed to support changes. ""It is with great excitement that I read the press release from the Central Falls Teachers' Union referencing their proposed comprehensive reform agenda,"" said Central Falls Schools Superintendent Frances Gallo in a news release. ""It so closely mirrors my requests for assurances that I am pleased to reassure the union their place in the planning process. I do so with the belief that everyone has come to understand the meaning of comprehensive school reform."" Gallo added the school district will press ahead with its plan for improving Central Falls High School. In a written statement, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the union was pleased that Gallo has agreed to go back to the table. ""The dedicated teachers and staff want nothing more than to continue and improve upon the progress they have made,"" Weingarten said. ""Real, sustainable change will only happen when all stakeholders work together."" Gallo's statement came a day after the Central Fall Teachers Union recommended a number of changes, including increasing instructional time for students, enhancing their support and increasing teaching quality. Last week, the school board approved Gallo's plan to discharge 93 people -- classroom teachers, administrators and other personnel -- at the high school. The school is in a low-income area, and many of its students are Latino with English as their second language. The firings, which were to have become effective at the end of the school year, came after the district failed to reach an agreement with the teachers' union on a plan for teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores. A union spokesman said the firings were drastic and cited a 21 percent rise in reading scores and a 3 percent hike in math scores in the past two years. Another official also pointed to progress at the school. But Rhode Island's Education Commissioner Deborah Gist defended the mass firings, calling them ""many years in coming."" Gist pointed out that the school's graduation rate is 48 percent, and ""only 7 percent of the students are proficient in mathematics."" ""More than half of the ninth-graders are failing more than two classes, which is an indication that they are frustrated, and what we know about student achievement, when students aren't successful in their class, they're much more likely to drop out of school,"" Gist said. In remarks Monday to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, President Obama appeared to express support for the firings. ""If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year, if it doesn't show signs of improvement, then there's got to be a sense of accountability,"" he said. ""And that's what happened in Rhode Island last week at a chronically troubled school, when just 7 percent of 11th graders passed state math tests -- 7 percent."" The AFT said Obama's comments ""do not reflect the reality on the ground and completely ignore the teachers' significant commitment to working with others to transform this school.""",0.77698815,8666
4,"San Diego, California (CNN) -- President Obama deserves an A+ for his agenda for education reform. His decision to nominate Arne Duncan as U.S. education secretary was inspired, and his comments on holding the system accountable are honest, refreshing and insightful. Obama showed that again this week with a powerful speech at James C. Wright Middle School in Madison, Wisconsin. He announced that, in the coming weeks, states would be able to compete for their share of more than $4 billion in funding through the administration's Race to the Top initiative. But in order to do that, he said, the states have to demonstrate that they're serious about increasing accountability by doing things like tearing down ""firewall laws"" that prevent districts from factoring in student performance when evaluating teachers. That sinister brainchild was brought to you by politically influential teachers' unions who make it their solemn mission to protect their members from the scrutiny and standards that everyday people have to put up in their jobs. Obama's not having any of it. ""If you are committed to real change in the way you educate your children,"" he told his audience, ""if you're willing to hold yourselves more accountable, and if you develop a strong plan to improve the quality of education in your state, then we'll offer you a big grant to help you make that plan a reality."" Like no president in recent memory -- except maybe George W. Bush, who diagnosed that schools are often afflicted with ""the soft bigotry of low expectations"" -- Obama gets it. What Obama ""gets"" is that America's public schools often underperform and help cheat students out of brighter futures for three main reasons: . 1) There are low expectations, not just for students but also for parents, schools and whole communities that are written off as not able to compete academically. Too many educators let themselves off the hook by telling themselves that poor kids from struggling backgrounds are somehow incapable of learning as well as kids from wealthier communities. 2) Too many educators and politicians treat public schools as if they exist for the benefit of the adults who teach there rather than the kids who are supposed to learn there. Because teachers have unions and students don't, everything -- including the length of the school year -- is geared for the convenience of the work force and not the clientele. 3) Those intent on preserving the status quo resist tooth and nail any attempt to hold them accountable by linking teachers to the performance of their students or, in an idea that Louisiana is trying and that Duncan smiles upon and would like to see spread to other states, tracing back teachers to the schools of education that produced them. Obama understands all that. And, it seems, the president learned it during his stint as a community organizer in Chicago, Illinois. It was there that he went to bat for low-income black parents who, like scores of parents who send their kids to underperforming schools throughout America, are caught in a frustrating and almost comical paradox. They're turned away, shunned, treated with condescension and even insulted by self-serving public school ""edu-crats"" who treat these institutions like their own private offices where they don't want to be bothered by anyone who doesn't have a teaching or administrative credential. Then, incredibly, the parents are blamed for not participating and involving themselves more in that hostile environment and when many of them thought that teaching their kids was the job of, well, teachers. It's been my experience that many teachers don't really care whether parents go to the PTA or help their kids with homework. They just want a constant foil, someone to blame when students flounder and the schools underperform. And, when that happens, in any public school in America, suddenly there's not a mirror to be found. It's always someone else's fault. I know what you're thinking. Teachers love to portray columnists, analysts and pundits as clueless about the real world of teaching unless we've actually taught in the classroom. Been there, done that. Before I ever started writing a column, I taught for nearly five years in a poor farming town in central California where most of the students were the children of Mexican farm workers. And I learned more about education there than I did from taking graduate courses at Harvard. I bet that a lot of public school teachers -- many of whom, according to exit polls, vote Democratic -- are already missing the Bush administration. At least when they were battling the accountability law known as No Child Left Behind, they could say it was someone else's idea put in place by a president who other people elected. Now, they must confront the unpleasantness that comes with a reform effort being pushed by an administration that many of them support. One way to square that circle is try to make Duncan out to be the problem, as if the education secretary has gone rogue. Recently, I heard from a professor of education at a state university in San Diego who bristled at the former college basketball player's call for reforming teachers' colleges. ""Mr. Obama,"" she wrote, ""please fire Arne Duncan and let him go back to the basketball court."" Cute. Smug but cute. Trouble is, this week, Obama made clear that, when it comes to fixing our schools, he and the education secretary are on the same team.

5,"San Diego, California (CNN) -- In most high schools in America, they teach Shakespeare. But at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island, they're acting out a Shakespearean drama. Only instead of the famous line from Henry VI -- let's kill all the lawyers -- what we have is: ""Let's fire all the teachers."" That's exactly what Central Falls School District Superintendent Frances Gallo did in February. In a move that was bold but also justified, Gallo fired 77 teachers at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island, along with the school's principal, three assistant principals and other administrators. In all, the district said, 93 people were let go in the purge. The school board later stood by Gallo and approved the action. The mass firings, which take effect at the end of this school year, came after the district failed to reach an agreement with the local teachers' union on a plan that would have required teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores -- with only a small increase in pay. Consistent with federal guidelines designed to improve the educational system, Gallo asked teachers to work a longer school day of seven hours and tutor students weekly for one hour outside school time. She proposed teachers have lunch with students often, meet for 90 minutes every week to discuss education and set aside two weeks during summer break for paid professional development. Think of it as asking teachers to go back and fix what they didn't do right the first time. Central Falls High School is one of the lowest-performing schools in Rhode Island. It operates in a community where the median income is $22,000, according to census statistics. Of the school's 800 students, 65 percent are Latino and most of them consider English a second language. Half the student body is failing every subject, with 55 percent meeting requirements in reading and only 7 percent in math. ""No thanks,"" said the teachers. ""You're fired,"" said Gallo. Upon hearing this story, my first thought was how do we get this woman out of Rhode Island -- and down to Washington to clean house by demanding results from the politicians? Apologists for the public schools and other defenders of the status quo will hear those statistics, and say: ""Well, how do you expect educators to reach and teach a population like that?"" Easy. I expect teachers to do it by putting aside the excuses, setting higher expectations, adhering to better standards, giving into common sense reforms and doing their jobs in a school that serves a vulnerable population that is especially in need of a quality education -- but also, and here's the good news, in many cases, extra motivated to get one. Forget that poor-kids-can't-learn nonsense. It wasn't true 100 years ago and it's not true now. Besides, there is no ideal student population. Whenever I write in support of education reform -- whether proposed by Democrats or Republicans -- or, for that matter, whenever I challenge teachers in any way, I get an earful from angry and defensive educators who demand to know if I have ever been in the classroom. I interpret their comments to mean that if have never been a teacher, I ought to just pipe down and keep paying my taxes so they can grow their salaries at a respectful rate. I will keep paying my taxes, but I will not pipe down. Not that I think it matters, but, in fact, I have been in the classroom. I taught for nearly five years at the K-12 level in Central California. I've taught the kids of poor farm workers, but I've also taught the kids of doctors and lawyers. Now guess which group was more respectful of authority and eager to learn, and which was more likely to think of itself as entitled and privileged? In teachers' lounges, I've heard teachers complain about kids who are poor and disadvantaged. But I've also heard other teachers complain about those who are spoiled and overly advantaged. Why? Because that's what teachers do. They complain. They can't help it. It's in their professional DNA. Everything is always someone else's fault. They never want to accept responsibility for kids who drop out of school but they're the first in line to claim credit for the kids who wind up in the Ivy League. One minute, they're arguing that the parents have all the power over how a child performs. The next, they're denying those same parents the right to have more options and a greater say in their kids' education through charter schools and voucher programs. The contradictions are astounding. And now thanks to the Obama administration, whose approach to education reform is, interestingly enough, an exact replica of that of the Bush administration, teachers and teachers' unions have even more to complain about. The American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation's largest teachers' unions, even complained about President Obama after the chief executive referenced the Rhode Island firings and praised the school district for taking the action. ""Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right,"" Obama said in a speech this week to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This, AFT president Randi Weingarten insisted, was nothing more than an attempt by Obama to ""score political points by scapegoating teachers."" So, teachers' unions, how's that hope and change working out for you? It seems to be working pretty well for the country, since Obama is obviously serious about education reform. Back in Rhode Island, Gallo said this week that she is willing to negotiate now that the local teachers' union has agreed to support the changes she proposed. You don't say? The firings worked. Score one for accountability and common sense. Now, Madame Superintendent, about that trip to Washington...

6,"(CNN) -- A school board in Rhode Island has voted to fire all teachers at a struggling high school, a dramatic move aimed at shoring up education in a poverty-ridden school district. In a 5-2 vote Tuesday night, the board approved the plan by Frances Gallo, superintendent at Central Falls School District, to discharge the teachers, administrators and other personnel at Central Falls High School. The firings, which will be effective at the end of this school year, came after the district said it failed to reach an agreement with the teachers' union on a plan for the teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores. A union spokesman called the firings drastic and cited a 21 percent rise in reading scores and a 3 percent increase in math scores in the past two years. The school district said 93 people -- including the principal, three assistant principals and 77 teachers -- were fired. The teachers' union said the firings affected 74 classroom teachers plus a number of other educators such as guidance counselors and reading specialists. Central Falls High is one of the lowest-performing schools in Rhode Island. It is in a community where median income is $22,000, census figures show. Of the 800 students, 65 percent are Hispanic and for most of them, English is a second language. Half the students are failing every subject, with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math, officials said. In a proposal based on federal guidelines, Gallo asked teachers to work a longer school day of seven hours and tutor students weekly for one hour outside school time. She proposed teachers have lunch with students often, meet for 90 minutes every week to discuss education and set aside two weeks during summer break for paid professional development. A spokesman for the union said the teachers had accepted most of the changes, but wanted to work out compensation for the extra hours of work. The superintendent said the two sides could not agree on a pay rate. Under new federal requirements for school reform, low-performing schools have several options. One is called the transformation model, which includes a series of changes that teachers agree to adopt. When the negotiations on those changes failed at Central Falls High, the superintendent switched to another option: the turnaround model, which means firing every teacher at the troubled school. Kathy May, a teacher at Central Falls High, said she's disheartened. ""I feel like, after 20 years, I can see some progress beginning to be made. And I'm sad that we're not going to be around to follow that through, to push that forward."" Gallo, who said Rhode Island law says notice must be given by March 1, said the problem isn't solely the fault of teachers and it wasn't her preference to make the move. She indicated that some of the teachers might be rehired. ""When we had to move from the transformation model, the next best move was the turnaround model. And that requires us to remove the teachers and rehire, of those who reapply, up to 50 percent,"" she said. ""This is a major move, for a very significant reason, and that being that we couldn't hone in on the assurances we needed for the transformation model."" Asked what would happen if the teachers' union accepted the original terms, Gallo said it would be very difficult to go back, but can't be discounted. ""And if ... as we move forward, if indeed something of that effect comes around, then I still think we have a lot of doors that could be opened."" At a community rally before the school board meeting on Tuesday, supporters of the teachers slammed the plan. Jane Sessums, president of the Central Falls Teachers Union, said teachers have been unfairly targeted and scapegoated and the union will fight to have them reinstated. ""We want genuine reforms, not quick fixes that do nothing but create a wedge between teachers, our school and our community,"" said Sessums. She added that ""teachers have agreed to numerous solutions and reforms."" George McLaughlin, a guidance counselor who was fired along with his wife, a chemistry teacher, said the school  has been inaccurately cast as a place with low graduation rates. ""We have the most transient population in this state. Nobody comes close to us. So when they say that 50 percent of the people graduate, a very high percentage of our students leave our school. They return. They leave again. They go back to other countries,"" he said, noting that three times as many of the school's students are accepted to colleges now than they were five years ago. He also knocked the superintendent, saying she ""has been with us for a little more than three years."" If Gallo were willing to negotiate and listen to former Sen. Lincoln Chafee, who has offered to mediate, ""maybe we could resolve this instead of causing more trauma to us.""

7,"(CNN) -- Little Rhode Island made big news in the education arena last month. Superintendent Frances Gallo fired all the teachers at Central Falls High School after negotiations with the teachers' union failed. The move was triggered by low test scores -- only 7 percent of 11th-graders passed the state math tests, and 50 percent of the students at Central Falls failed to graduate in four years. Appalling numbers. Gallo wanted teachers to increase the length of the school day and spend time tutoring kids. The teachers' union was not convinced. Even President Obama got involved and supported the firing, saying, ""If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year, if it doesn't show signs of improvement, then there's got to be a sense of accountability."" Yes, accountability is right, but who is supposed to be accountable for this massive failure to learn? The general consensus is that the teachers are responsible. Is it really all the teachers' fault? Columnist Ruben Navarrette Jr. thinks so. Having been a teacher himself for five years, he says teachers just like to complain. He doesn't say why he is no longer teaching, but he applauds the firing and blames the teachers. Superintendent Gallo agrees. She fired all of them. Everyone agrees that the K-12 schools are failing, but the reasons are not as simple as Navarrette and Gallo think. Firing all the teachers is not the answer. Closing schools is not the answer. Schools aren't failing because the teachers don't care or aren't trying. It's not because teachers fail to follow the curriculum. It isn't because they are poorly paid. Teachers go into teaching because they want to make a difference and help kids. They certainly don't go into teaching to get rich. They don't want to do a bad job, either; no one likes to fail. A recent survey of 40,000 teachers by the Gates Foundation shows that teachers are more interested in reform than money. If you examine Central Falls High School closely, a few things stand out: More than 96 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch, according to the school's Web site, and only 6 percent of the people in the town have a college degree. Does that tell you something important about the parents? They are struggling financially and lack postsecondary education. Central Falls provides little or no parental support for students or for the teachers, yet everyone expects teachers to do it all with few resources. Clearly, it does not work. In his book entitled ""Does Money Matter? the Effect of School Resources on Student Achievement,"" Gary Burtless argues that the ""home environment has strong effects on student achievement, stronger in fact than social class effects."" He argues that the most important home environment variables involve ""parents expending time participating in activities with children that enhance learning."" Very little, if any, of this is happening in the communities of a failing school. Look at where the schools are failing -- in the most densely populated areas of the 50 largest American cities. Teachers are not magicians. Low test scores and the dropout rate cannot be blamed on the teachers alone. They need help from the parents, help from the community, help from the administrators, help from state and federal governments. Thousands of kids starting kindergarten each year don't know colors, counting, or even the names of fruits and vegetables. Their vocabularies are hundreds of words fewer than their more advantaged peers. Who is talking to these kids? The electronic nanny -- the television. No teacher can effectively educate a child without support from the parents. Support at the elementary level means spending time with their child, reading to their child, talking with their child, providing a stable home for their child. Support in high school means a quiet place to study, recognition and approval for kids' efforts, and helping when they are not doing well. Strong schools have supportive parents and an involved community. Schools like Central Falls High School have struggling communities. To fire all the teachers and blame them for the failure is to dismiss the important role that parents and communities play in the education of their children. Imagine firing all the parents -- does that solve the problem? What we have in communities with failing schools is parents who are for a variety of reasons -- mostly economic -- failing to parent effectively. They have no time. The job of mothering is passé. Let's look at how ineffective school closures have been in Washington, where Chancellor Michelle Rhee has closed many schools. Test scores are up, but scores dropped on the federal government's broader measure of how local schools are doing in meeting the standards of the No Child Left Behind law. Or take a look at the Chicago Public Schools, where former CEO Arne Duncan, now U.S. secretary of education, closed many schools. There's been little change in scores because students are being transferred to other low-performing schools. It hasn't worked because the community's attitude and level of support hasn't changed. A report released on March 1 by The Education Trust shows that schools often lumped together as ""low-performing"" are not all alike. ""Examining data from reading and mathematics assessments for elementary and middle schools in ten states, the study's authors found that some low-performing schools remain stuck year after year, and others that started low performing are among the fastest improvers in their states."" Solving the problem requires individual solutions tailored to each school, not a blanket approach. The U.S. Department of Education needs to change its focus and stop its policy of supporting the closing of failing schools; it does not bring long-lasting change. No Child Left Behind has had unintended negative consequences. Instead, we as a nation need to support teachers in the classroom and stop using teachers as scapegoats in seeking to solve a major national problem. We need to work with teachers, not fire them.

8,"Cottage Grove, Minnesota (CNN) -- Unlike many other boys his age, 17-year-old Levi Dubov wakes up excited to go to class each day. ""There is no other place like this,"" he says, as he finishes up breakfast in his school's basement cafeteria. Dubov is talking about his Yeshiva school outside Minnesota's Twin Cities, known simply as MyYeshiva. The boys' school not only focuses on the study of Judaism. It's one of a few Yeshivas nationwide that combines religious teaching with a focus on students with special learning needs. The school aims to help kids who are ""stuck in the middle"" -- who can't keep up with the pace of regular schools, but haven't completely given up either. ""[It's] a place for kids that are struggling everywhere else,"" the school's director, Rabbi Moshe Weiss, said. ""There wasn't ever a place for those kids."" Students come from all over the country to attend this boarding school, including many from low-income households. ""We wanted to try and help those kids out there that need more attention,"" Weiss said, sitting in his office after just returning with the students from a twice weekly hockey trip to the local ice rink. Since opening in 2006, the school has seen its enrollment double from its inaugural class of 18 students. Dubov, now in 11th grade, feels more at home here than he did at his previous Yeshiva in his hometown of Montreal, Canada. ""They told me I was a weak learner,"" he said.  But he says at MyYeshiva he excels because of the different pace of teaching. Tzemi Zimmerman, a ninth-grader from Chicago, Illinois, says he struggles with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ""In another school, if you can't keep up with the learning, they'll tell you ... 'We're going to have to suspend you,'"" Zimmerman said. He says the school's dedicated time for physical education -- another unique quality of this Yeshiva -- makes it easier for him to sit through classes. ""It makes you feel like people care,"" he said. ""It's just -- you're wanted. You're part of everybody."" Victoria Livshutz, whose son attends the school, says he would be in a much different situation if it weren't for the school. ""They are just like a family, which, to me, is very important,"" she said. ""Because even though he is a big boy, he still needs a lot of attention."" The school's co-founder Rabbi Mordechai Friedman calls MyYeshiva a place where ""there's a little bit less of the stress in learning, a little bit more relaxed in academics."" ""We want to know how you are doing -- not just what your test scores look like,"" Friedman said. While the school may be unique in many ways, it's still a functioning business. The rough economy hasn't passed by unnoticed. Weiss acknowledges they've had difficulty making mortgage payments this past year. If they can't come up with the remainder of the building's cost in cash or five-year pledges by May 15 -- about $500,000 -- they'll be forced out. ""We're talking about these kids' home and the future kids that are going to come here,"" Weiss said. ""I believe that with God's help, the best case scenario is going to occur."" While this year the school has set tuition at more than $18,000 a year, it typically operates with a ""pay what you can"" mentality. But this is the first time since the school opened four years ago that not one of the 36 enrolled students has been able to come up with the full amount. Weiss blames a combination of factors. ""Throughout last year, lots of our parents lost their jobs,"" Weiss said, adding that they also ""lost donations due to the economy, some large."" Regardless, students and faculty are optimistic. ""What'd they say about Chrysler? Too big too fold. We're not as big as Chrysler -- yet. But we're too important,"" Friedman said. ""To see the kids we're helping, there is no way in my mind that this won't continue,"" Rabbi Weiss said. ""God is not that cynical."" Levi Dubov says without this school, he'll likely end up moving to Israel where his family lives now.  That means he'd have to join the Israeli army after his 18th birthday. But Tzemi Zimmerman offers a reassuring assessment: . ""Someone will pull us through,"" he said. ""We're going to keep going on like this for many more years, and one day maybe I can send my children here.""",0.75803995,9659
9,"Editor's note: Steve Perry is the founder and principal of the Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford, Connecticut, and author of ""Man Up!: Nobody is Coming to Save Us,"" which offers solutions to problems in the black community. Steve Perry says a question from a parent started his journey to creating a top-performing school. HARTFORD, Connecticut (CNN) -- ""Why do only rich kids get good schools?"" I was the founder and director of a part-time out-of-school college preparatory program. The questioner was a parent; herself a victim of a dulled urban education. The statement was more of an indictment than question, and I had no answer. ""Well, why can't this program be a school,"" she offered. The program sent 100 percent of our graduates to college. We served poor students who were the first generation in their families to attend college. We provided college preparation through a six-week summer program, after-school tutoring and in-school academic advising. That single mother's question came at the end of the summer program. This was always a tough time. As the kids said goodbye to their friends and the program's high expectations, we all looked at the school year with great trepidation. We knew that the students were returning to failed schools with very low expectations -- and results to match. Like that mom, I too wondered why wealth and whiteness are too often linked to quality education. Her question connected to a discussion that I'd been having with some colleagues during the summer program. All of the teachers in that program worked in failed urban schools. Many had tried to reform traditional urban schools. They'd started formal and informal programs, identified groups of kids and connected to parents. Each had had some success with some kids, but the conditions that led to the need to do something went unchanged. The question was raised at the end of our 2002 summer program. My first instinct was to begin down the path of opening an all-male minority charter school. In Connecticut, charter schools are publicly funded and privately run, with no teachers' unions, no school board influence and no centralized curriculum. These were the pluses. There was only one minus: There was no money. The charter idea was dead as soon as it began. I assembled an all -black team. My plan was to put black educators together, and we would show 'em. Brothers and sisters were gonna open a successful charter school. Black educators serving black kids. This was my first major mistake. Talent and commitment have no color. Kids don't care what color their teachers are, and I shouldn't have either. After almost a year of stops and starts with a team that was not effectively assembled, I realized that I failed in my judgment because I did not keep my eye on the goal, which was to build a school that sent kids to college regardless of their hue or economic status. I have never made that mistake again. I doubled back and went into the schools and found the teachers who stayed the latest and arrived the earliest. I looked for the most ambitious teachers who had a reputation of being the most talented, and we started a second team. I am a social worker. I knew that I could run an organization, but wasn't sure about developing curriculum. When I created Team 2, my first pick was the best teacher I could find. Rich Beganski is the perfect complement, or opposite, of who I am. He's meticulous and lives and breathes curriculum. He is an operations genius. He was a longtime assistant coach who never wanted to be coach. I've never been an assistant and don't want to be one. Our team was composed of a white guy, a Latina, a black woman and a black man bound by a single commitment: to send kids to college. In 2003-04, Connecticut was settling a desegregation case. A component of the agreement was to open eight magnet schools in Hartford in two years. Magnet schools are publicly funded and publicly run theme-based schools, complete with unions and subordinate to the local school board. The part-time college preparatory program was hosted in a community college. The college's president was an impulsive visionary. On a Friday afternoon elevator ride from the 10th to the seventh floor, he said, ""Steve, we're gonna start a high school, you should run it."" I told him I would and got off on the seventh floor. First thing that following Monday, I was in his office with the dead charter school application. Over the next few months, we tweaked it until it became a magnet application. With the help of some of the program's parents, we submitted it to Hartford's mayor, superintendent, and then the board. The process was anything but smooth. The district could not conceptualize what Capital Prep would become. A year-round college-preparatory uniform school for grades six to 12 was the absolute antithesis of the district's offerings. Hartford was either the worst or second-worst school system in Connecticut, with a high dropout rate and three failed traditional high schools. At first, Capital Prep was a poorly received idea. It became real, in large part, because of the state's settlement and our team's determination to answer the question. After receiving school board and state approval in December 2004, we were expected to open for August 2005. The problem was that while we had a ""team,"" Capital Prep didn't have a single employee. Since we were becoming Hartford Board of Education employees, we all had to apply for our jobs. My hire was relatively painless. Beganski, the team's operations genius, was turned away as an ""internal"" candidate. After two years of working 30 hours a week to turn an idea into a reality, he became our first central office/union casualty. I promised to resign if he wasn't hired. Finally, the district relented and gave him the job that he had designed. This was to become an ongoing theme in the school's first few years: ridiculous actions focused on maintaining the failed status quo. We worked through the summer with the rest of the team. The district stumbled and stalled until, with less than two weeks before our first day of school, Capital Prep only had two staff members: Beganski and me. We were not allowed to hire a single teacher. Even though we had had a team that had worked for years researching and designing the school for no money, we were told that none of them could be hired because union rules dictated who and when we could hire. This meant that our last employee for year one was hired 14 hours before the first day of school. In the years that have followed, the struggles with the union and central office's narrow, regressive policies have tested our commitment to answer that mother's simple question. The complexity of the answer is rooted in Capital Prep's relationship to the failed policies of the once highly centralized district and educators' union. In recent years, a new superintendent has come on board -- the third in our first three years. His approach has been absolutely aligned with what we need to exist. He leaves us alone as long as we get results. He can't shield us from the unions, but he has supported our creativity and commitment to our kids. He lets me run the school, and our teachers teach what works. That's all we've ever sought. Answering the question of ""why only the rich kids get good schools"" has set our team on an odyssey. Seven years later, we have an answer that we are proud of. Rich kids are not the only kids who have good schools, because Capital Prep's 80 percent black/Latino, 60 percent poor students attend one of America's top high schools, according to US News & World Report.

10,"(CNN) -- This spring break, thousands of college students will ditch the bars and the beaches to do something more meaningful with their vacation time. Brad Vonck (bottom, left) and other student volunteers worked with the Cherokee Nation in Stilwell, Oklahoma. Brad Vonck is one of them. A sophomore at the University of Illinois, Vonck will travel to San Juan, Texas, in a group of 13 students to volunteer with La Union del Pueblo Entero, an organization that helps strengthen the communities and lives of farm workers and their families. ""Learning about different cultures is very important to me,"" Vonck said. ""I like to engage in different areas of life that I don't really understand."" Every year, more and more college students, like Vonck, are choosing to spend their valuable time off from school participating in ""alternative spring break"" programs -- community service-based opportunities dealing with the most pressing issues of the day, including hunger and homelessness, disaster relief and global warming. ""If you can name a social issue, then students are doing trips around it,"" said Jill Piacitelli, executive director of Break Away, an organization that trains and helps colleges across the United States promote alternative break programs. For the past six years, these programs have been growing in popularity among college students. Break Away estimated that this year, nearly 65,000 students will participate in its alternative break programs, an 11 percent increase from 2008. ""It's a student-led social movement. ... This is a group that very much wants to be involved in the world around them,"" Piacitelli said of the volunteers. ""They're solution-oriented. They want to innovate and lead and involve their peers."" The average domestic trip costs around $250 or $300, Piacitelli said, which includes ""housing, travel, social activities, food and often a donation to the community."" Many university programs offer financial aid and the option to raise money to help pay for trips. ""It is rare that anyone who wants to go on a trip cannot go,"" Piacitelli said. The affordability is part of the reason why so many students return for second or third trips. Nikunj Shah, a graduate of Arcadia University, has taken several alternative spring break trips volunteering in the United States and Mexico. This year, he will be traveling as an alumnus to Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, a city that has been largely ignored by disaster relief efforts in the wake of hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. ""I've always had an interest in helping people. I've always been really involved in community service,"" Shah said. ""So I saw this as an opportunity to go places I haven't been before, to get a feel for different cultures and to help people there that truly need help."" In an effort to expand their alternative spring break options, universities across the United States partner with humanitarian organizations like the United Way of America. Randy Punley, director of corporate and media partnerships at the United Way, oversees the organization's Alternative Spring Break programs. After Hurricane Katrina, the United Way partnered with MTV to engage young people in the response effort. ""We knew there was an interest and a passion in young people for the work we were trying to achieve,"" Punley said. Since then, the United Way has evolved and expanded, establishing chapters on college campuses. The organization has also developed an Alternative Spring Break Social Media Challenge, encouraging young people to be active in their communities and use social media Web sites, like Facebook or Twitter, to involve other people. ""Whether it started with the first Gulf War, punctuated by the September 11 attacks and Katrina and the economic meltdown, young people have a very different perspective about what's going on in the world,"" Punley said. At the end of the weeklong trip, most students say it was the best week of their lives, Punley said. The increasing interest in these programs, Punley believes, speaks volumes about the attitudes of Generation Y, a group of people who are eager to make an impact on the world around them. ""It's such a difference from going home and not really feeling accomplished to going on these trips and meeting new people,"" Vonck said. ""You get experiences that you wouldn't get sitting on the couch watching TV for a week."" Piacitelli said these programs encourage young people to continue serving their communities and those in need. ""The students are the main benefactors of what goes on,"" Piacitelli said. ""It changes their consciousness. They get really interested in social issues ... They see themselves as active citizens, and helping the community becomes a priority."" Like Vonck and Shah, University of Illinois senior Adriana Collazo has a passion for community service. During her spring break last year, Collazo traveled to the Bronx in New York to volunteer at a homeless shelter. She stayed at a hostel with other volunteers and helped serve food and organize clothing drives. ""I never really had all that money to go off and do the whole Cancun, Mexico, spring break, and I didn't really want to, because I think that's throwing away money,"" Collazo said. ""When you can give back, it's selfish."" The trip to the Bronx was a personal one for Collazo who, at the age of 6, experienced poverty firsthand when her family became homeless. ""My family's better now, and I want to give back,"" Collazo said. ""I think a lot of students have realized that they can do better things with their time. ... It humbles you.""",0.7412181,1945

12,"MODESTO, California (CNN)  -- Some of the people hit hardest by this bad economy are the youngest. Almost 2 million children nationwide have had or will have their lives disrupted by home foreclosures, according to one study. There are more empty desks in Suzell Tougas's fourth grade classroom after 10 students have stopped coming. These are the children whose families have had to move, sometimes more than once. The youngsters are pulled out of school, often leaving their friends behind without even saying goodbye. Nine-year-old Kenia, who is in the fourth grade at Fairview Elementary School in Modesto, California, said that is what happened to her. She is new to the school, having moved to the area just a few months ago. She said it is really hard and she misses her friends. Her classmate Bethany said her best friend since kindergarten just left without saying goodbye. Heather Sharp, the principal at Fairview, said her school has been the one most affected by the bad economy in the Modesto City School system. ""We have, over the last couple of months, 50 students coming new to the school and 50 students leaving,"" Sharp said. It was so bad that the school conducted a door-to-door search for missing students, she said. ""We had our community aide going out to houses. And they were boarded up, windows boarded, yard brown. She had to go to neighbors to find out where the kids were."" In terms of raw numbers, California had the most foreclosures of any state from 2007 through January 2009. More than 57,000 homes entered foreclosure. Many of those were in Stanislaus County, where home prices have declined 65 percent since December 2005, according to the Modesto Bee. Fourth-grade teacher Suzell Tougas said she has lost 10 kids from her class so far this year and is braced to lose more. She usually has a room full of children with every desk occupied. Now, it ""looks empty ... it's like a ""ghost town"". She said constant moving is hard on kids. ""Just having to start over and start over is really hard on a child,"" Tougas said. ""It takes six weeks for a child to adjust ... at least."" While children are in that period of adjustment, she said, they aren't learning and their studies suffer. ""The biggest issue is that when [children have to move] when there are other stressors going on, we know it puts these kids at greater risk for being behind in their academics,"" said Pat Popp, a past president of the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth. That is borne out in a recent study by a nonpartisan group in Washington called First Focus. It said that children who move twice in one year are only half as likely as others to be able to read proficiently, and may have a greater chance of being held back. It also found that  moving a lot reduces the student's chance of graduating from high school by half. Read the report here . The report, published in May, estimated that 1.95 million children will be affected by foreclosure over the next two years. The number of homeless students is increasing dramatically. A study by the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children reported that more than 450 school districts across the nation had an increase of at least 25 percent in the number of identified homeless students between the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Read the report here (pdf) A student who moves ""may hear the same information again that you learned in your previous classroom or miss information that has already been covered in your class but wasn't taught in your previous school,"" Popp said. The fallout from the rash of foreclosures likely will have a long-term impact on education, especially in California. Schools get much of their funding from property tax revenues. Real estate values are spiraling downward and so is the revenue. At Fairview Elementary, Principal Sharp worries about students like 9-year-old Eunice, who has moved twice in the last year. Her parents told her that after they pay their mortgage this month, they won't have any money for a week. But, Sharp said, children are resilient. ""We don't give them credit for what they can handle but, at the same time, the flip side is it's sad -- they shouldn't have to handle it. They should be able to know they can go to school and focus on reading and math and recess.""",0.73921597,1881

""I never thought that I would go back to school, all this time, and I'm glad I did."" She is one of more than 1,100 Pennsylvanians taking tuition-free community college courses as they search for a job. Many are concentrating on new job skills, such as computer programming and accounting, to retrofit their résumés so they can compete in a turbulent job market. ""The response was incredible,"" said MCCC President Karen Stout. ""The day after we announced the program, our call center lines were clogged up. We had more than 300 calls in the first two or three days, and we had information sessions that had standing-room-only attendance."" It's a trend echoed at community colleges across the country. George Boggs, president of the American Association of Community Colleges, said he has heard from 75 college presidents reporting double-digit enrollment increases this semester. ""Community colleges are a big part of the solution to this economic downturn,"" Boggs said. ""We are the institutions that are on the ground bringing these individuals into our institutions and preparing them for a new career."" Boggs pointed to programs in hard-hit industrial manufacturing states, such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as being particularly geared toward mid-career students. Many community colleges have cut or frozen tuition for laid-off workers, established scholarship programs or offered financial assistance to pay for textbooks and transportation costs. However, the spike in applications has put a burden on some schools that already are struggling to keep tuition low and upgrade their facilities. ""Many [community colleges] are reporting that it is the highest-ever enrollment that they have had,"" Boggs said. ""And several are reporting a waiting list of students that they can not accommodate. ""It wouldn't surprise me to hear that about a half-million students are being turned away from our community colleges today."" At MCCC, enrollment is up 10 percent since spring 2008. But the school has been able to place the new students in courses that aren't at capacity. ""We are worried about our bottom line, especially in this economic environment,"" MCCC President Stout said. ""But we do have classes that are scheduled to go that have open seats. So basically, these were empty seats that we're filling with unemployed workers."" If unemployment continues to rise -- in Pennsylvania the jobless rate is 6.7 percent -- Stout wants to continue offering tuition-free classes. And even once these mid-career students get back on their feet, she's hoping to see them around campus still. ""Our goal is that these students want to come back and be lifelong learners -- that they understand that in today's economy, you have to continue to keep your job skills relevant and up to date,"" Stout said. ""None of us can be complacent about our own learning."" Her plan may be working. Much to Janice McFadden's surprise, she has discovered she loves being a student. ""I'm looking at it as a wide-open possibility for me. I don't have to stay in the same field that I was in, I can go back to school ... I can be anybody that I want to be now,"" McFadden said. ""I just have to pick what I really like, what I'm good at, and concentrate on that.""",0.7374526,1733
14,"(CNN) -- Her school has become a symbol of the kind of crumbling infrastructure that President Obama hopes his stimulus bill will improve. South Carolina student Ty'Sheoma Bethea was invited to the speech after she wrote a letter to lawmakers. But on Tuesday, Ty'Sheoma Bethea became the face of the issue, when she joined first lady Michelle Obama as her guest for the president's first speech to a joint session of Congress. The White House invited Bethea, a student at the J.V. Martin Junior High School in Dillon, South Carolina, after a letter she sent lawmakers appealing for help rebuilding her school made its way to the president. The eighth-grader flew with her mother, Dina Leach, from South Carolina to Washington to attend Tuesday night's speech. On Wednesday, back home in South Carolina, Bethea explained what she wanted the president to do. ""I just want for him to help my school out and to get us a bigger and better school and build us a new one, and I would thank him for that."" she told CNN. The eighth-grader was inspired to write the letter by Obama, who mentioned her school in his first presidential news conference on February 9. After visiting the school, he referenced J.V. Martin as evidence of educational institutions that would benefit from school construction funding in his $787 billion stimulus package. iReport.com: 'A very emotional moment' In her letter, Bethea described the dilapidated condition of her school, which was built in 1896, and said the funds would improve the building and the quality of education. ""We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself, and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of South Carolina, but also the world. We are not quitters.""  Watch Obama quote Bethea in speech » . Obama repeated Bethea's statement about not quitting during his address. ""It was great to hear the president say my quote,"" Bethea said Wednesday. ""We are not quitters because anything is possible, and I don't think we should give up so easily. We should work harder for it."" Poorly maintained and ill-equipped schools in South Carolina's ""corridor of shame"" were an issue during the Democratic primary as evidence that education reform had to be an imperative for the next president. The schools became an issue again last week when South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, said he might turn down some of the money in the stimulus. And South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, said turning down money was an ""insult"" to blacks. ""We have legislation here now with the money to do something about the schools, do something about water and sewage along that corridor in these 12 counties. And now the governor says, 'I don't want to accept the money.' That's why I called this an insult, that's why I said this is a slap in the face, because a majority of those counties are, in fact, inhabited by African-Americans,"" Clyburn said on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. In his speech Tuesday, Obama vowed that education is among the priorities of his administration. He urged Americans to take advantage of the promise of an education.  Watch Obama discuss education » . ""In a global economy, where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity. It is a prerequisite,"" he said. ""It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work, but it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it."" Obama said. iReport.com: What would you fix first? ""So tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be a community college or a four-year school, vocational training or an apprenticeship.

15,"San Francisco, California (CNN)  -- Before the protests of tuition hikes last week, a colleague posted the following: ""Need suggestions for protest songs. We have a DJ but need to give her a play list."" The requests started coming in: Joan Baez, the Dixie Chicks, The Clash. I wondered about the overlap between songs on a professor's play list and those on a student's. So I went to class and asked students to tell me what they wanted to hear. The list included Dead Prez, Lyrics Born, B-Side Players and Erykah Badu, among many others. This is the protest play list of a new generation. My introduction to protest songs came through my mom. As the daughter of a Chicano movement activist, I attended protests against wars in Central America and rallies in response to police repression. Last week, I marched in solidarity with people across 17 states calling for well-funded, accessible public education. While at the March 4 rally, I realized that California's public education system has had a great impact on who my mother and I are today. As a 15-year-old immigrant newly arrived in Los Angeles, my mother was placed in remedial classes because she didn't speak English. She struggled with the language but excelled in math. Yet her high school counselor directed her to work at a local tortilla factory. This was the early 1960s, just a few years before students responded to educational inequities through organized acts of civil disobedience that would later be referred to as the East Los Angeles blowouts. It was only by chance, and without parental or institutional guidance, that my mom enrolled in East Los Angeles College. Like many other low-income and working students, community college was her entry into higher education. It was not until her mid-30s that she enrolled in the California State University of Los Angeles while working full time. I was in elementary school and remember going to campus with her on days that my dad was working, even during an in-class exam. This was my first exposure to a university classroom. Since then, I have taught at the California State University of Los Angeles and the University of California at San Diego. I am currently an assistant professor at San Francisco State University. Watching preschool teachers and children participating in the recent marches reminded me that my education began at Head Start. My mom enrolled me in this program, which provided early reading and math skills and set a foundation for my educational development. I stand in solidarity with early childhood educators. At the protest, I watched high school students confidently take the stage and list their demands and hopes for a better future. I wish that my mom, as a teenage immigrant, could have aired her own frustrations with the 1960s educational system. Today's high school students inspire me, and I am proud of today's teachers, who support their students. I ran into some of my own students at the rally. One asked where she could hear the DJ playing her song request. We searched through the sea of people and realized the turnout was much larger than we had imagined. The protest play lists of multiple generations filled the air with music. Young fans of Dead Prez marched and chanted alongside older fans of Joan Baez. They all recognized the need for well-funded, accessible public education. Rising student fees have placed barriers between thousands of eligible students and their dreams of higher education. In addition, budget cuts and the subsequent elimination of course offerings have extended the number of years necessary to graduate. Many of my students have taken on multiple jobs to finance their education. I hear their stories and imagine my mom trying to attend Cal State L.A. today. Younger generations in the U.S. have consistently achieved a higher level of education than the generation that came before. But for the first time since World War II, we are in danger of reversing that trend. Students and educators view education as a public good available to all and will continue mobilizing to restore funding for public education. Will they receive support or will education become a luxury available to fewer and fewer people? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Katynka Z. Martínez.",0.72963166,8773
16,"Central Falls, Rhode Island (CNN)  -- The teacher at an embattled Rhode Island school who displayed an effigy of President Obama in his classroom is under disciplinary review, according to the school superintendent. The Obama effigy was an apparent protest of the president's support of mass firings of the school's teachers. Its existence was first reported on CNN.com on Thursday. An Obama doll, about a foot tall, hung by its feet from a white board; the doll held a sign that said, ""Fire Central Falls teachers."" Superintendent Frances Gallo discovered the item late Monday at Central Falls High School after being asked about a rumor about an Obama doll hung by his feet in a classroom. Gallo took it upon herself to investigate and found the effigy Monday night. ""It was obviously imprudent on [the teacher's] part, very ill-conceived and nothing to fool around with,"" Gallo said. Bold superintendent hated, loved . The superintendent said the teacher was contrite when confronted but said it was ""a joke to him."" Due to union contract stipulations, Gallo said she could not disclose the name of the teacher. Gallo said it was difficult to comprehend how a teacher could not ""understand that a class full of children are very offput by such a 'joke.' ""He doesn't see it as making a mockery or, worse, just total disrespect,"" Gallo said. ""Clearly, he wasn't thinking."" She said the matter is under disciplinary review and has been sent to Rhode Island State Police. State police have not returned phone calls seeking comment. The local teachers union condemned the act Thursday. ""Simply put, the teacher's actions were wrong and cannot be condoned under any circumstances,"" Jane Sessums, president of the Central Falls Teachers Union, said in a written statement. ""The teacher has apologized verbally to his students and has asked Superintendent Frances Gallo for permission to apologize to them in writing. He understands that his actions affect not just his students but all of us. There is no excuse for what he did."" A source, whom CNN is not naming because of the sensitive nature of the story, said the teacher is a beloved member of the faculty who has done a tremendous amount of good over the years. Many of the students in the class are immigrants who hold Obama in high regard; they were learning English as a second language, according to the source. Central Falls High School has been at the center of an educational firestorm in recent weeks after all 93 teachers, support staff and administrators were fired for the low performance of the school. Gallo took the drastic action after talks with union leaders fell through. The firings will go into effect at the end of the school year. Teachers can re-apply, but no more than 50 percent will get rehired. The high school has been failing for the past seven years. Its graduation rate stands around 48 percent. Math proficiency is at 7 percent. Reading scores have improved by 21 percentage points in the past two years but still fall far behind, with 55 percent able to read at grade level, according to school officials. Most of the 800 students at Central Falls are Hispanic. For many, English is a second language. Teachers say the population is so transient that the statistics are a skewed and unfair representation of the students' smarts and the teachers' skills. Animosity toward Obama built among teachers after the president endorsed the school's plans for reform. Marcia Reback, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, said last week that teachers were peeling Obama bumper stickers off their cars. ""When the president of the United States celebrates a superintendent of schools for mass firing an entire faculty of teachers, then that is saying something about his attitude toward teachers,"" she said. ""And it's not a healthy attitude.""",0.7268198,9049
17,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Washington manicurist Lidia Schaefer returned to her native village in Ethiopia, she was troubled by what she saw: children walking three hours each way to attend classes held not in a school, but under a tree. Lidia Schaefer sold her house and car and set aside tips and part of her salary to raise money for the school. When she learned in 1998 that one of the girls she'd met -- Medhine -- had been attacked and killed by a hyena after falling behind other children during the long trek home from school, Schaefer knew she had to act. She began setting aside a third of her salary and all of her tips, and later sold her house and car, to raise enough money to build a school for the village. ""She's definitely not your average manicurist,"" says Denise Abrahams, a longtime client. ""This is the kind of thing that you hear about Oprah Winfrey doing."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes . For Schaefer, it was simply a matter of doing what felt right. ""I don't work with my head,"" she says. ""I really work with my heart.""  Watch Schaefer's clients and colleagues discuss her efforts » . Born in Feres Mai, a large village in northern Ethiopia, Schaefer moved to the United States in the mid-1970s when civil war broke out at home. During her troubling visit back home in the '90s, she recalls, ""I promised the children I was going to open a school for them."" But she had no idea how to tackle such a big project, especially while raising her own two children and working 12-hour days, six days a week.  Watch Schaefer speak with CNN's Larry King » . The motivation to fulfill her promise came with the news of Medhine's death. ""That really pushed me to do it,"" she says, ""to build a school so that wouldn't happen again."" Schaefer lobbied the Ethiopian government to donate land in a central location so the school could serve children from several nearby villages. The decision was made to build a secondary school, since the nearest one was more than 18 miles away. Back in Washington, Schaefer began setting aside money for construction of the school. ""I was working two days for the school, four days for me,"" she recalls. Her clients and co-workers rallied to help, holding raffles and making contributions. Several clients bought individual doors or windows for the school.  Watch Schaefer talk about the school » . But Schaefer realized it wouldn't be enough. To finish the school, she needed to do something drastic. In 2002, she gave up her symbols of the American dream, selling her home and car. It's a sacrifice that still stuns her colleagues and friends. ""I couldn't believe it,"" remembers salon manager Patty Gonzalez. But Schaefer saw nothing remarkable about her decision. ""I don't feel like I [gave] up a lot,"" she says. ""I want [the children] to learn, to get something out of their life."" Schaefer ultimately raised more than $250,000 for the school, which was completed in 2006. When she went back for the dedication, Schaefer was honored with an elaborate procession through the village. For her, it was gratifying to see what she'd accomplished. ""I was so happy, I can't even describe it,"" she recalls. Today, nearly 1,500 students are educated in the school, which boasts an eight-building campus with 16 classrooms, a science lab and library. ""It's simple, but it's nice,"" Schaefer says. Though she'd hoped to name the school in memory of Medhine, the government -- which runs the school -- instead named it the Lidia Secondary School, telling Schaefer, ""We want it to be your name so that more people [will] be like you."" Schaefer has indeed inspired many others to follow her example. When Ethiopian communities around the United States heard about what she'd been able to achieve, they launched an effort to build more schools in her region of northern Ethiopia. So far, they've raised enough money to build 12 schools, due to be completed by July 2009. Schaefer still sets aside her tips and wages to support her school and has kept up her fundraising efforts to buy supplies. A colleague at the salon designed T-shirts to raise money for desks for the students. Schaefer's next goal is to equip the school with computers. ""They need computers so they can talk to the whole world,"" she says. Her colleagues and clients say Schaefer serves as an important reminder that people don't need money or power to make a difference. ""She's very inspiring to me,"" says Gonzalez.

18,"Editor's note: Pedro A. Noguera is a professor at New York University and director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education. He is editor of ""Unfinished Business: Closing the Achievement Gap in Our Nation's Schools"" and author of ""The Trouble With Black Boys: And Other Reflections on Race, Equity and the Future of Public Education."" Pedro Noguera says Obama needs to be wary of alienating teachers who can be his allies on education reform. (CNN) -- President Obama has made it clear from the earliest days of his presidency that he intended to make education a high priority for his administration. He reaffirmed that commitment Tuesday when he addressed schoolchildren on the topic. In one of his first presidential addresses, he made a special appeal to students at risk of dropping out: ""... [D]ropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American."" The president's commitment to education is truly remarkable, considering the enormous array of policy challenges confronting the administration. From health care and the economic crisis, to global warming and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration is beset by controversies that will not be easily resolved. The fact that the president and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, have not allowed education to be ignored or placed on the back burner says a great deal about their recognition of its central importance to our nation. However, as the administration navigates its way into the policy debates that are swirling over the future of education, it would be wise for it to proceed with caution. The administration has already staked out positions on a number of issues -- charter schools and merit pay for teachers being two of the big ones -- which run the risk of generating additional controversy in the polarized debates over how to reform education. If these issues and the stimulus money being made available under the Race to the Top (RTT) program are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue. The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers. The current policy debates over the direction of education are typically presented as battles between the reformers, led by school superintendents like Joel Klein of New York and Michelle Rhee of Washington, D.C., and the defenders of the status quo, most often presented as the powerful teacher unions and other elements of the education establishment. While anyone familiar with the current debates knows that the differences between the two sides are real and profound, a protracted battle over the direction of education reform is not a good thing either for the administration or for those who genuinely want to see improvement in public education. Instead of choosing sides, it would be wise for the administration to do all it can to find common ground between the opposing camps as it formulates new policy initiatives. For example, instead of requiring states to adopt some form of merit pay for teachers -- a measure to which both the teachers' unions, the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have already declared their opposition -- the administration could encourage states to adopt school-based formulas that reward increases in student achievement. This is similar, though not identical, to the approach taken in New York City, one that encourages collaboration among teachers and recognizes the importance of evidence that children are learning. Similarly, rather than touting charter schools as the solution to public education, the administration should treat the best charters as models of innovation that provide educators with the flexibility to implement new strategies. This is a subtle but important distinction that has been lacking in many of the administration's pronouncements about charter schools. Unlike the public schools, many charter schools find ways to avoid serving the most disadvantaged students, and their teachers often work a longer day and longer school year without a contract. Moreover, many of the best charters are subsidized by private philanthropists and are able to spend considerably more per pupil than traditional public schools. These facts should not be used to negate the accomplishments of the excellent charter schools that have emerged in many large cities. In fact, it is far more likely that struggling public schools in these same cities would be more open to learning from the charters' accomplishments if they were not cast as competitors. Finally, the president has championed the idea of ""promise neighborhoods"" as a way to increase the availability of social services to children in high poverty communities, using as a model the Harlem Childrens Zone. If this initiative is to result in lasting benefits to children, it will need to be combined with creative approaches to reforming urban public schools that re-formulate how we think about standards and focus attention more intently on how to deliver quality instruction to children. With dropout rates at over 50 percent in several of our nation's cities, the administration must realize that tinkering at the margins with No Child Left Behind will not deliver the change we need. The president entered office promising to bring a new kind of politics to the nation, an approach that focused on finding common ground among diverse constituencies to solve the pressing problems of our time. In areas like health care, energy, the economy and foreign policy, this new approach has not yet gained traction. However, it is not too late for the president to unite the nation around a common effort to improve public education. For this to happen, he will need to keep above the fray and stay focused on a strategy that sends a clear message to all constituencies that working together to improve public education is in our national interest.

19,"(CNN) -- High school athletic director Brian Bordainick felt like he'd been shot when he learned the crushing news about his ""9th Ward Field of Dreams"" project. Coach Shyrone Carey, left, and athletic director Brian Bordainick are rebuilding a once-dominant football team. Architects who had agreed to help the Katrina battered Carver High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, win an NFL grant to build a $2 million stadium were pulling out -- the weekend before a Monday deadline. The firm apologized, Bordainick said, but it would not be able to provide a design proposal for the facility, which was critical to winning the $200,000 grant. ""I've never been shot, but I imagine it felt something similar to that,"" said Bordainick, recalling that day in December 2008. To make matters worse, swarms of news media were gathering at the school to interview the 23-year-old boy wonder -- the self-described ""youngest high school athletic director in Louisiana"" -- who was leading an effort to bring Carver's athletic program back from near death. ""I sucked it up, did the story ... and when they left, I picked up the phone book and started calling architects in the city.""  Watch update on New Orleans' schools after Katrina » . In an amazing moment of serendipity and opportunity, an entrepreneur friend of Bordainick's happened to be at a party and cornered a partner in one of the city's top architectural firms. The friend called Bordainick and -- before handing the architect the phone -- told Bordainick: ""You've got 30 seconds to give your best elevator spiel you've ever given."" The architect was Steve Dumez, design director for Eskew+Dumez+Ripple, who agreed to help, despite Bordainick's preposterous plea. Watch Bordainick tell his story . ""The one-day turnaround came as a bit of a shock,"" Dumez said. ""What was crazy about it was trying to pull together an entire design proposal -- and that's just something that doesn't happen in 24 hours."" Usually such design proposals require as long as a month to complete. ""How could you not get sucked into such an amazing story?"" asked Dumez's partner, Mark Ripple, a 30-year veteran New Orleans architect. ""There really isn't a good outlet in the area where kids can develop skills and self-esteem and all the things that come with a healthy recreation program."" The next day, the firm organized a small army of construction companies, civil engineers and architects who offered their support. ""We got the satellite images and the renderings done in 8 hours,"" Bordainick said. The proposal worked. In March the school learned it had won the NFL grant. Nike also has backed the project -- donating $100,000 and joining thousands of individuals who have offered $1.5 million in pledges, cash and services so far. All this during one of the nation's worst-ever economies. Bordainick credits much of the fundraising success to a network of e-mailers who started with a Web site created by a Web-developer-turned-Carver teacher. He crafted an e-mail touting his ""passion for building character through sports,"" and ""creating something from nothing"" while working with ""people crazy enough to believe that they have the power to create change."" ""I made it a goal to just e-mail a couple hundred people a day,"" he said. ""I was teaching and calling people during my lunch break, and trying to get other people to make calls during their lunch break, and e-mailing people and doing all these things to get the word out about what we're doing and what we're trying to accomplish."" The proposed stadium -- which would host football, track, soccer and lacrosse -- is just one facet of Carver's struggle to regain its former self four years after the ravages of Katrina. A perennial football powerhouse, the team re-formed after Bordainick arrived at Carter in 2007, his first year in the Teach for America program. He touts athletics as ""changing the dynamics of the school and having it not be someplace where the bus just drops you off in the morning."" But four years after the storm, Carver students on the 65-acre campus are still struggling to learn without the benefit of permanent classrooms. All of Carver's 530 students -- down from more than 1,000 students before the storm -- still attend classes in FEMA trailers. The actual building which used to be the school is now boarded up. The cafeteria is a hollowed-out shell. The school district has plans to rebuild Carver's classrooms and other facilities, but it's not clear when. ""If you kick a field goal on one side of our football field -- the ball goes into the gym, which was condemned after the storm,"" said Bordainick. ""And, if you kick a field goal on the other side, it goes into a house which was knocked off its foundation from Katrina."" The track team, he said, now practices on nearby city streets. Last season, the Carver Rams failed to win a single game. But many fans, school officials and alumni are hoping the proposed stadium will increase pride and confidence for the revitalized team and student fans. ""If we give kids some constructive things to be involved in -- guide them and give them discipline, we can help them achieve their dreams,"" said Charles Webb, a project board member and 1965 Carver quarterback. ""It'll bring back pride the way it used to be."" ""With a sense of pride and teamwork, anything can happen,"" said Carver head football coach Shyrone Carey. Carey -- a standout running back for Louisiana State University from 2001 to 2005 -- arguably couldn't have chosen a more challenging post as his first head coaching job than rebuilding Carver from the ground up. ""The overall motivation that comes from athletics is an overall lifelong lesson,"" said Carey, who's pushing his players hard in advance of a big game Saturday. ""If you make the right decisions then positive things can come."" Backers of the 9th Ward Field of Dreams hope to break ground sometime next year and complete construction in time for the 2010 football season. Supporters are trying to bolster support by offering the stadium for use as a free jogging track and a venue for middle school sporting events. ""If we're able to lock sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders in at a younger age, we'll be able to train and get them into mentors' hands so they're able lead a more successful life, ultimately,"" Bordainick said. ""This school -- and these children overcoming the odds stacked against them -- can be a real catalyst for rebirth in this city,"" Bordainick said. ""I think it can be something that people can look to, and something that people can rally behind.""",0.70829594,8725
20,"(CNN) -- Sidney Frank made millions marketing Jagermeister and other alcohol brands. Three years after his death, he's a big hit with students at the Ivy League college he briefly attended. Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University. He's a big hit not because of what he sold but because he's given dozens of them what he couldn't afford as a young man: an education at Rhode Island's Brown University. On Sunday, 49 students from low-income families became the first four-year Sidney E. Frank Scholars to graduate from Brown, owing virtually nothing except gratitude to the late liquor magnate. ""The world of difference that he made for each and every one of us is unbelievable, incredible,"" one of the Frank Scholars, 22-year-old Shane Reil, said Sunday. Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004. He stipulated that the fund's income go exclusively to covering all tuition and expenses for the neediest of Brown's admitted applicants.  Hear graduates say how their dreams came true » . For this year's graduates, tuition and expenses came to a four-year total of about $180,000 each. The median annual income of the recipients' families was $18,984. The gift was the largest single one ever given to Brown and one of the largest ever given for undergraduate scholarships in the United States, according to the school. Reil, a history major who is preparing to co-chair a student conference on U.S.-South Korean relations and aspires to work in politics or foreign service, says the scholarship was the stuff of dreams. He was working up to 40 hours a week during high school so he could pay for clothes and even help with grocery bills. He and his mother were getting by, but the Massachusetts native thought community college or a big state school would be all he could afford. When his academic achievements put Brown in his sights, he thought he'd have to go into too much debt to go there. But he applied anyway, and Brown invited him to campus to tell him about how much the school would award him. ""I sat in this guy's office ... and he said, '$37,000 for tuition,' "" Reil recalled. ""I said, ""$37,000, that's going to be split over four years, so essentially I'm getting a $10,000 scholarship per year.' ""He said, 'No, no, that's $37,000 for this year, and it will be covered [the rest of the years] too.' "" Reil said he cried in the office and ran to his car, where his mother was waiting. ""She was crying so much, we had to sit in the car for so long because she couldn't drive. It was a great moment,"" Reil said. ""Having the opportunity to go to a really good school ... I think it took my world from a very small area and physical space and just expanded it in multitudes,"" he said. Though other universities give full rides, Frank's gift was a coup for Brown. Like many other schools, Brown used to factor a family's ability to pay when deciding whether to accept students. Brown no longer does that, and Frank's gift was ""integral"" in bringing the change, said Jim Miller, Brown's dean of admissions. The school intends to give 30 to 35 Frank scholarships per year. Most recipients are the first in their families to go to college, Miller said. That was the case for Eliana Reyes Castro, who was born in the Dominican Republic and came to the United States when she was 6. She said she attended a Massachusetts high school that had regained its accreditation only months before she graduated. Like Reil, she was one of the Frank Scholars who graduated Sunday. She received a degree in education with a concentration in human development and will pursue a master's in secondary social studies and history at Brown. She might have attended Brown even if she had to take out loans. But that might have taken her away from what she wanted to do -- teach -- in favor of something that she had less interest in but paid more, she said. ""Just teaching right after college ... might not have been as appealing if I had loans to worry about,"" Reyes Castro said. Frank, though he went to Brown only one year, landed an engineering job at Pratt & Whitney in part because someone there had gone to the school, said his daughter, Cathy Halstead. The company sent him overseas and he worked on Allied airplane engines during World War II, she said. Eventually he got into the liquor business, started the Sidney Frank Importing Co. and marketed Jagermeister and Grey Goose vodka in the United States. He took up Jagermeister in the 1970s, sending attractive young women to bars to persuade patrons to try the drink and coming up with the Jagermeister tap machine. He created Grey Goose, had it distilled in France and brought it into the United States through importers. In 2004, he sold Grey Goose for $2.2 billion, said Halstead, 61, of Seattle, Washington. When Brown gave him an honorary degree in 2005, not long after his gift and months before his January 2006 death, people gave him a hero's welcome, she said. ""People on both sides [of a procession] were yelling his name and yelling, 'Jager!' and yelling, 'Goose!' "" she said. He gave millions of dollars to other institutions and projects. As for the Brown scholarship fund, he started it because he saw that Brown had changed the course of his life, Halstead said. ""He really wanted kids who were coming from very economically challenged backgrounds to have the chance to make it all the way through,"" said Halstead, who attended Sunday's graduation ceremony. Reil and Reyes Castro said they couldn't thank Frank enough if he were alive. ""What he did is a catalyst for a lot of great things, and I'm indebted to him to do the best with the education that I've gotten here to help people in any way that I can,"" Reyes Castro said.",0.7069236,4043
21,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Seventh graders at Ron Clark Academy became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their YouTube performance of ""You Can Vote However You Like"" catapulted them to online stardom. ""The higher the expectations, the higher the results,"" says Ron Clark, seen here with his students. Now, their creative and scholastic talents have proved the students to be more than just ""one hit wonders."" Academy students showcased their poetry and writings for CNN's documentary ""Black in America 2,"" hosted by Soledad O'Brien. Cultivating student creativity is just one of the goals of academy founder Ron Clark, an enigmatic educator known for his unconventional teaching methods. Under his strict tutelage, students at Ron Clark -- who are predominantly African-American -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers. ""I'm teaching an eighth-grade curriculum to fifth-graders,"" says Clark. ""Some people say my expectations of the kids, academically, is too high, but the higher the expectations, the higher the results."" But with high academic expectations come an equally high quotient for fun. It's become one of Clark's trademarks: singing and dancing to popular rap and R&B songs during class to get the kids engaged. ""My first day at Ron Clark Academy, I thought all the teachers were psychopaths,"" says seventh-grader Jai Springs. ""I thought Ron Clark was going crazy. He was up in front of the kids on desks, he was dancing. ... I never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance. But now I'm used to it, so I get up on the desk and dance too,"" says Jai. Clark, formerly a schoolteacher from South Carolina, founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled The Essential 55, which detail Clark's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom. Clark was invited to be a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show after winning Disney Teacher of the Year Award in 2001. Oprah believed so much in the well-mannered Southern school teacher from South Carolina that she encouraged him to write the book. Later she promoted The Essential 55 on her show, prompting it's ascension to New York Times bestseller list. Together with co-founder Kim Bearden, Clark transformed a decaying factory in a rough part of Atlanta, Georgia, into a state-of-the-art educational model for middle schools across the country. Soon after the school opened its doors in 2008, a Christmas package from Winfrey arrived for Clark in the form of a $365,000 grant, or ""a thousand dollars for each day of the year,"" as Oprah referred to it in the letter. Then came the elections, with a tight presidential race between Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona. Inspired by rapper T.I.'s hit song ""Whatever You Like,"" Clark's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves. The students' performance carried a message: Cast your ballot because you support a candidate's policies rather than just his skin color. When they perform the song, half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of GOP's McCain while the other half root for Democrat Obama: ""Obama on the left. McCain on the right. We can talk politics all night. And you can vote however you like."" The students ""can talk politics with the best of them,"" says Clark. Video clips of the kids performing have garnered over 15 million hits on YouTube. ""We got lots of media attention. But when the media arrived to the school they realized the song is not the story, it's the kids,"" says Clark. One of Clark's credos is teaching a ""global curriculum"" with a heavy emphasis on current events. Himself an avid world traveler, Clark believes it's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live. Through Delta's corporate sponsorship of the school, administrators have been able to send all 100 of their fifth to eighth grade students abroad before they graduate. ""I'm not nearly as shy as I used to be,"" says seventh-grader Chi Chi Kasarachi after her first year at the academy.

23,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An English-language immersion class failed Miriam Flores, her mother contended. A divided Supreme Court dismissed on Thursday a 17-year-old suit filed on behalf of English-deficient students. After two years of instruction in her native Spanish, Miriam entered the Nogales, Arizona schools' English Language Learner program as a third-grader. However, she continued to lag behind her classmates and was cited as a disruptive influence in the classroom because she often had to ask a fellow student for help. The girl's mother, also named Miram Flores, and other minority parents claimed school officials in Nogales, a border town about 70 miles south of Tucson, did not provide enough money to get English-deficient students up to speed in writing and reading comprehension. In 2000, a federal judge agreed, concluding Arizona violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act, and ordering the state to rework its plan and increase funding. The English Language Learner (ELL) program was then placed under federal oversight. On Thursday, a divided Supreme Court dismissed the 17-year-old lawsuit, but ordered a federal judge to review whether Nogales officials are ""providing equal opportunities"" to mainly Spanish-speaking students in the community. Arizona maintained the federal court injunction delayed its plans to fix the system. It maintained it has provided enough resources to improve its ELL program, allowing it to end federal oversight. ""Injunctions of this sort bind state and local officials to the policy preferences of their predecessors,"" wrote Justice Samuel Alito for the majority. Some legislators claim a 2006 state law essentially eliminated long-standing funding inequities. But parents say officials continue to drag their feet when it comes to complying with an appropriate classroom model for non-English-speaking students. Arizona says it increased more than twofold the amount of money it spends per non-English-speaking pupil, and that it has complied with the No Child Left Behind Act, the sweeping public classroom accountability act passed in 2002 that ties federal education funding to improvements in measurable student achievement. The current dispute has pitted the GOP-led state legislature and the school superintendent against the Democratic governor and attorney general, along with civil rights and teacher groups. Alito said a federal law guaranteeing equal opportunity in public schools ""is a vitally important one, and our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to achieve that goal."" He added that if state officials ultimately prevail in their reform efforts, ""it will be because they have shown that the Nogales School District is doing exactly what this statute requires -- taking appropriate action to teach English to students who grew up speaking another language."" Alito was backed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. But in a lengthy dissent -- parts of which were read from the bench -- Justice Stephen Breyer said the ruling was ""misguided,"" calling it ""a mistaken effort to drive a wedge between review of funding plan changes and review of changes that would bring the state into compliance with federal law."" He was backed by Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter. The divided court seemed poised to issue a narrow ruling, fact-specific to the ELL plan in Nogales. But groups on both sides of the issue asked the high court for broader guidance on settling state-federal conflicts involving institutional reform mandates, especially those involving disadvantaged groups. Such political turf battles often end up in the courts, and can lead to decades of federal oversight, such as the fight over school desegregation beginning in the 1950s. Against that backdrop is the continuing fight over immigration and the responsibility of states to fund the education of illegal immigrants and their children. Miriam Flores is now an adult and a student at the University of Arizona. The cases are Horne v. Flores (08-289) and Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives v. Flores (08-294).",0.6883599,8884

26,"Editor's note: Harvard Business School Professor Clayton M. Christensen and Innosight Institute Executive Director of Education Michael B. Horn are the co-authors along with Curtis W. Johnson of ""Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns."" Clay Christensen says the sudden burst of federal spending on schools holds great danger. (CNN) -- Historically the federal government has been a small investor in the nation's education system. With the recent economic stimulus bill, however, this changed virtually overnight. There is great danger in the sudden and massive amount of funding -- nearly $100 billion -- that the federal government is throwing at the nation's schools. District by district, the budgetary crises into which all schools were plunging created the impetus for long-needed changes. The most likely result of this stimulus will be to give our schools the luxury of affording not to change. This is borrowed money that we're pumping into our schools, and it comes at a price. Charging education isn't changing it. That our schools need to change should not be surprising. Just walk into your local school and enter a classroom. Odds are high that it won't look too different from a classroom from a generation or two ago. Sure, there might be some computers in the back of the room and perhaps an interactive white board instead of a chalkboard, but chances are high that students will still be sitting at desks lined up in neat rows with a teacher at the front delivering the same lesson on the same day to all the students. This might be acceptable if society and the skills many people need to succeed in today's economy hadn't changed either, but they have. While U.S. schools stand still, the rest of the world is moving forward, and this has a price tag -- not just for individual children, but also for the nation. We urge the federal government to consider four criteria when creating new programs or grants for states and districts to help transform an outdated educational system into one fit for the 21st Century. First, don't fund technology that simply shoves computers and other technologies into existing classrooms. We've spent well over $60 billion in the last two decades doing just that, and there is now overwhelming evidence that when we do it, the current unsatisfactory system co-opts the technology to sustain itself. We should instead use technology funding to bolster new learning models and innovations, such as online-learning environments, to level the playing field and allow students from all walks of life -- from small, rural communities to budget-strapped urban schools -- to access the rich variety that is now available only to children in wealthy suburban districts. Second, don't fund new school buildings that look like the existing ones. If the architecture of new buildings is the same as that of existing schools -- designed around teachers delivering monolithic, one-size-fits-all lessons to large batches of students -- it will lock students into another century in which the physical infrastructure works against the flexibility needed for student-centric learning. Instead, invest in bandwidth as an infrastructure of change. The government has a productive history in investing in infrastructure that creates change and innovation -- from allocating land to those building the transcontinental railroad and the land-grant colleges in 1862 to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funding the creation of the Internet. To allow all districts to realize the power of online learning to advance us toward a student-centric system, the federal government should help deliver broadband capabilities necessary not just for today's needs, where schools already lag, but also in anticipation of tomorrow's. Third, don't fund the institutions that are least likely to change. Our research shows that institutions are good at improving what they are structured to do, but that transformative innovations that fundamentally change the trade-off between cost and quality -- disruptive innovations -- come from start-up institutions. This means that there is a high probability that spending money on existing schools of education will only result in their doing more of the same, for example. Meanwhile, there are a host of disruptive training organizations that are providing comparable educators at lower cost, such as Teach for America, the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence, and New Leaders for New Schools. Alternative certification, including alternative programs from existing schools of education, has grown at a 29 percent compound annual growth rate since 1997. The government must embrace this and back the winners, not defend the old institutions. Fourth, direct more funds for research and development to create student-centric learning software. Just a fraction of 1 percent of the $600 billion in K-12 spending from all levels currently goes toward R&D. The federal government should reallocate funds so we can begin to understand not just what learning opportunities work best on average but also what works for whom and under what circumstance. It is vital to fund learning software that captures data about the student and the efficacy of different approaches so we can connect these dots. Transformation of any existing system isn't an easy process, but ignoring the laws of innovation, although it may be perhaps politically expedient in the short run, will only make it more difficult. When the federal government directs future funds toward education, having these principles in place will go a long way toward making sure we're not simply charging education, but that we have a fighting chance of changing it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clayton Christensen and Michael Horn.",0.67598045,6743
27,"(CNN)  -- Congressional auditors have uncovered widespread abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline special-education students in U.S. schools, with some deaths linked to the practices, a top congressman says. Investigators in Utah say a teacher left Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours. The findings are among those expected from a Government Accountability Office report scheduled to be released Tuesday. The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground. The GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students. ""I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,"" said Rep. George Miller, D-California, the committee's chairman. In other cases, children as young as 6 have been locked away ""for hours at a time,"" Miller said. ""What the GAO is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread,"" he said. ""The state regulations about how to handle these incidents don't exist in about half the states, and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations."" The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having ""special needs"" -- conditions including autism and Down syndrome -- are patchy at best. Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs. Only five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school. When confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution. Some of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions. State investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to ""shut up."" While the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing. His parents, Joshua and Becca Peck, said the child has an attention span of about 10 minutes, and they believe that after the first few minutes, he had no idea why he was in the cubicle. ""It was so sad. We felt it was a form of torture for him but he, being autistic, he had no way to express it,"" Joshua Peck said. ""He couldn't tell."" And Becca Peck said her son had been left in the cubicle with nothing but a magic marker -- which he used to scrawl all over himself. When she came to school to pick him up, ""He was covered in marker -- on his eyelids, on his hair, face, clothes, arms, eyelids -- everywhere."" ""I started thinking, 'What was he thinking?' Was he thinking, 'Why is my mom letting this person do this to me? Why am I here? I trust no one now.' "" In Garrett's case, like others cited by the GAO, the teacher remains on the job. And what frustrates experts is that efforts to force unruly children to comply don't actually work. At one school in Pennsylvania, however, teachers appear to have better results using sharply different methods. The Centennial School at Lehigh University serves severely emotionally disturbed children that have been passed from school to school, and even from juvenile justice centers. When school director Michael George came to Centennial in 1999, the school had documented more than 1,000 cases of restraint and seclusion that year. After the school revamped its approach, no such incidents were reported. When they get to Centennial, students can be violent and aggressive. But instead of trying to force a change in behavior, the school teaches the children new skills to get what they need. Children who might be violent because they are desperate to escape an uncomfortable task or environment learn to communicate their discomfort in nonviolent ways. Children who need to move frequently -- a common trait with conditions such as autism -- are permitted to do so, then re-directed to the task at hand. Staff are forbidden from saying anything negative about the children, parents or other teachers, even among themselves. And when a child acts violently, the staff is trained to step aside, rather than immediately attempt a potentially dangerous restraint. On a recent visit to the school, all students appeared to be calm and receptive to teachers. The school's philosophy can be summed up in a question George likes to ask teachers interviewing for jobs there: Which teacher you remember most from your own childhood? ""No one ever mentions the person who yelled at them, who screamed at them, who told them to write a phrase a hundred times, who slammed them into closets, who was abrupt, who made them feel stupid. No one ever mentions those people,"" said George. ""Our job is to teach. Sometimes the children we are teaching here present extraordinary challenges; it can be very, very difficult. But that's the job we chose to do.""",0.66869664,3894
28,"(CNN)  -- Congressional auditors have uncovered widespread abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline special-education students in U.S. schools, with some deaths linked to the practices, a top congressman says. Investigators in Utah say a teacher left Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours. The findings are among those expected from a Government Accountability Office report scheduled to be released Tuesday. The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground. The GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students. ""I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,"" said Rep. George Miller, D-California, the committee's chairman. In other cases, children as young as 6 have been locked away ""for hours at a time,"" Miller said. ""What the GAO is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread,"" he said. ""The state regulations about how to handle these incidents don't exist in about half the states, and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations."" The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having ""special needs"" -- conditions including autism and Down syndrome -- are patchy at best. Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs. Only five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school. When confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution. Some of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions.

29,"(CNN) -- A California movement protesting $1 billion in budget cuts to the state's university system appeared to have burgeoned into a nationwide demonstration on Thursday. Students and professors in dozens of states were challenging administrators and state lawmakers over budget cuts and tuition increases that they say are reducing students' class options and increasing their expenses. Some of the demonstrations turned chaotic. In Oakland, California, police arrested 160 protesters who shut down a major freeway, according to city police spokeswoman April McFarland. The Oakland protesters had left a march from the University of California, Berkeley to Oakland City Hall and wound up on the Interstate 980/880 interchange, CNN San Francisco affiliate KGO reported. KCRA: Protesters threaten to block interstate . McFarland said the protesters brought Thursday evening rush hour traffic to a halt for an hour and 45 minutes. One man is in critical condition after he tried to elude arrest by jumping off the freeway onto a tree, KGO reported. He fell from the tree onto the street below, a roughly 22 foot drop from the interchange, according to KGO. At the University of California Davis, police held back student protesters who had threatened to shut down nearby Interstate 80, CNN affiliate KCRA in Sacramento reported. Police fired rubber bullets into the ground in an effort to deter students, who made it as far as an I-80 exit ramp just south of campus. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, at least 15 people were arrested in demonstrations Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ. A University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee vice chancellor allowed a protester to drop off pamphlets in the chancellor's office, then called campus police when dozens of protesters tried to enter the building, according to WTMJ. University police called the Milwaukee Police Department for backup, and officers spent an hour rounding up protesters. Students yelled ""Let her go!"" and ""What did he do?"" as Milwaukee police led students into their black and white vans. Across the country, students told of having to work second jobs and make lifestyle adjustments in the face of dramatic tuition hikes. ""I work at two jobs, go to school full time to make ends meet,"" said Tyler, a fifth-year senior at San Francisco State University, where students and faculty protested Thursday. She did not give her last name. ""I have been here a really long time. I struggle to keep [taking] classes to be able to keep my financial aid every semester, and I really don't know when I'm going to be able to get out of here. Every semester, something is cut, and I can't get the class I need. Who knows when I will be out of here,"" she said. Many of Thursday's demonstrations focused on cuts to state-funded colleges and universities, which supporters say drive up tuition, limit classes and make higher education unobtainable to many. A blog called Student Activism, which was compiling a list of the protests, said that 122 events were scheduled in 33 states -- most on campuses, and some at state capitols. Are you taking part in protests? Send photos, videos . Professors and students say dissatisfaction, anger and an uncertain future had led to call for a ""Day of Action"" to defend education. At the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, dozens of protesters gathered Thursday and chanted, ""Hey hey, ho ho, these student fees have got to go."" Video submitted from the demonstration by a CNN iReporter calling himself Bowtieguy showed students carrying handmade signs with messages like ""Where's Holub's pay cut?"" -- a reference to university chancellor Robert C. Holub. Another homemade sign read ""Chop from the top."" At California State University-Fullerton, dozens of students marched outdoors, chanting, ""Students united will never be divided."" A video submitted by a CNN iReporter who calls herself MelissaF showed handmade signs saying ""Protect humanities"" and ""What happened to our future?"" State funding for the California State University system was reduced by nearly $1 billion for the academic years between 2008 and 2010. Schools have responded by increasing fees, canceling classes, cutting student support programs and furloughing professors. Fees have increased 182 percent since 2002. Class waiting lists have doubled or tripled. ""The less affordable education becomes, the less likely low-income students will be able to get a college education,"" said Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association and professor of history at California State University Los Angeles. In addition to protests at numerous public colleges and universities in California, demonstrations also were planned for K-12 schools Thursday, according to the Student Activism blog. See where the protests are happening . On the other side of the country, in Georgia, a legislative committee proposed $300 million in cuts to the state's college system, on top of the $100 million cut in the past two years, University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams wrote in an open letter to students, faculty and staff. ""This is not our plan; these are not cuts we offered to make; and we will vigorously oppose any effort to implement them,"" Adams wrote. In response, student organizers in Georgia are urging fellow students at every college in the state system to wear black this week to ""symbolize the 'death' of our education,"" according to a post on Facebook. In Colorado, hundreds rallied at the Capitol in Denver, holding signs and cheering. Watch students march on Colorado Capitol . In New York, students at New York University, which is private, planned to meet up to protest tuition increases and education cuts with students from Hunter College and the New School, two other private institutions in Manhattan, said NYU student Claire Lewis. ""It is a private university, but like a lot of public universities, our tuition is also getting increased,"" Lewis said. ""This isn't anything new with the economic crisis with us; our tuition gets increased an average of 6 percent every year,"" she said. ""But lots of our students depend on federally funded grants and loans, and so the broader-nation education cuts definitely affect us."" She added, ""Kids literally work two or three jobs to pay for their tuition here.""

30,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sheila Wash greets her son and daughter, 13-year-old Cecil and 9-year-old Sheliah, every day when their school buses arrive ""home."" Sheila Wash says being homeless has been an ""eye-opening experience"" for her. They talk about the school day, their homework and even joke that Sheliah can't remember what she ate for lunch. The fourth-grader wonders aloud, ""What did we have? We had something good."" But it's hardly a homecoming for any of them. The Wash family has been homeless since 2007, after Sheila lost her government job. She says unemployment benefits quickly ran out and, as she searched for a job, the family was forced to move six times in the last two years. They're now living in the Family Forward Shelter in Washington. ""I just thank God we have a roof over our head right now. You have to accept the things that come to you. You don't like them but, you know, until you can get your foot forward, you do what you have to do. We just keep going,"" Wash said. Wash's situation was only made worse as the economic recession set in. Jobs became harder and harder to find with more competition for each position. She says she's still searching. The Washes are part of the changing face of homelessness in America today. For years, homelessness has been depicted as that of an individual man or woman living on the street and begging for money. But with the perfect storm of the foreclosure crisis and the faltering economy, more and more families are becoming homeless. According to a recent count by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the number of homeless families in the Washington region alone has jumped 15 percent since last year. There are several national estimates of homelessness, but many are dated or based on dated information. TheU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development points to a study done in 2007 -- before the brunt of the foreclosure crisis hit --which stated that about 3.5 million people, 1.35 million of them children, are likely to experience homelessness in a given year. That study was conducted by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty . ""People lose their jobs. Their monthly household expenses spiral out of control because maybe their car broke down that month, and when you have such a tight budget with high rental costs, there is no room for error. And so that is what really leads families to the shelter door,"" said Mary Cunningham, author of ""Preventing and Ending Homelessness - Next Steps."" Reflecting on their struggles over the last few years, Sheila calls it ""eye-opening."" ""It's like they say you never know [someone] until you walk in their shoes, so truly I know now and if I ever get out [of] this situation, I will always give back to people less fortunate than I am because I know their struggles,"" Wash said. School officials in Prince George's County, Maryland, where the two Wash children go to school, say a day doesn't go by without the need to enroll another child as homeless. Denise Ross, supervisor for the school district's Homeless Education Office, said they've been inundated with requests. ""Some of them are embarrassed, some of them are scared, some of them are sad. They're just not sure what's going to happen next,"" Ross said. ""Students who are displaced or homeless students feel that school is a safe haven. They really want to come to school. They really want to attend school."" For homeless students, Prince George's County Schools offers free transportation to and from school, free breakfast and lunch, help with school supplies and also clothing. ""Either in the shuffle of being evicted or moving from shelter to shelter or place to place, their clothes may not have followed them. Or may have been set out and somebody may have taken them. So they may only have [the] clothes that are on their back. Our intent is always to provide them with at least three complete sets,"" Ross said. Sheila Wash says school is not only important because of her children's education, but it has also been an important source of stability in their lives. ""[A] very big help,"" she says. And help they still need with the obstacles ahead.  Watch Kate Bolduan's report on the Washes' plight » . The Family Forward Shelter is a hypothermia shelter, only open through the winter, which means the Wash family needs to find another temporary home, and they haven't had much luck. But with a smile that seems to never fade, 9-year-old Sheliah describes the one wish that keeps her family going. ""I wish we had a house with a car,"" she says. ""I pray that my mom, that we wake up in the morning and that [we] get a house and everything we wanted.""",0.6618499,3557
31,"(CNN) -- In tests for teacher Tom Farber's high school class, students can demonstrate their mastery of calculus and find out where to get braces or even a haircut. Calculus teacher Tom Farber is selling ad space on tests to defray printing costs. Squeezed by classroom budget cuts, the Rancho Bernardo High School teacher is selling ads on his exams to cover the costs of printing them. ""It raises money for the teachers and it's amusing for the kids, so it seems like a win-win,"" said Luke Shaw, 18, a student at the suburban San Diego, California, school. Parents and administrators also praise Farber, 47, for his creative classroom funding, but he doesn't want it to become the norm. ""My intention is, [selling ads] is a stopgap measure,"" said Farber. ""I don't want to be doing this year after year."" Instead, he says, government must do more to help educators provide what students need. Farber started letting parents and local businesses sponsor tests this fall after learning budget cuts would limit his in-school printing allowance -- tracked by the school's copy machines -- to $316 for the year. The cost of printing quizzes and tests for his 167 students will easily be more than $500, he said. That meant Farber, whose courses prepare students for the Advanced Placement exam, would have to give fewer or shorter tests, or find money. Farber, who says 90 percent of his students got a 5 -- the top score -- on AP exams last year, said skimping wasn't an option. ""It has to be a certain quality, or they won't be ready,"" he said. So Farber, who says he'd never asked for money from parents in his 18 years of high school teaching, pitched the ad idea to parents at a September back-to-school night. For checks made to the math department -- $10 a quiz, $20 a test or $30 for a final exam -- they could insert an inspirational quote -- their own or someone else's -- or a business advertisement at the bottom of the first page.  Watch how teacher came up with ad idea » . Of the seven to run so far -- one per test or quiz -- five were quotes, and two were ads from local businesses connected to the parents or someone close. ""Brace yourself for a great semester! Braces by Henry, Stephen P. Henry D.M.D.,"" read one of the ads in small type at the bottom of a quiz's first page. Farber said orders took off after recent media reports. He's collected more than $300, and he believes he'll top $1,000, with some ad buyers paying more than required. All amounts beyond his shortfall will cover colleagues' printing costs, he said. Farber said students and parents have gotten a kick out of the sponsorships. Student Scott Robison, 18, said: ""I liked it because all the teachers complain about budget cuts, and he did something about it. It hasn't hurt in any way."" Luke Shaw's father, Jay Shaw, said he wants to sponsor a test next semester. And while Jay Shaw praised Farber's idea, ""It's just sad it came to the point where he needs to do that,"" he said. Farber said he doesn't want quiz ads ""to become the standard."" ""What I'm doing now is ... dealing with the economic situation and making sure kids get what they need,"" Farber said. ""Teachers shouldn't have to scrounge for funding. To me, this is what our government is for, to provide necessities, and that's why we pay taxes."" But California's budget crisis has forced Farber's school district, Poway Unified, to cut costs, district Superintendent Don Phillips said. The California Federation of Teachers says the state cut more than $4 billion in education spending this year. Phillips said that when the district sought to chop $11 million from its $265 million annual budget, it wanted to keep teachers but cut other areas. Among the things to go was 30 percent to 40 percent of Poway schools' materials spending -- including copying. Phillips praised Farber's ad idea as creative. But he said district officials are weighing whether to set guidelines, especially for business ads. Farber said he'd prefer to keep ads to local ""mom-and-pop"" operations. He's accepting one from hair salon Fantastic Sam's, noting that although it's part of a chain, the store that's buying the ad is locally owned. Farber and Phillips said they don't know of any Poway teachers wanting to replicate the ad idea, but they said educators there have long spent out-of-pocket for supplies. Susan Carmon of the National Education Association said a 2003 study on the issue found U.S. teachers spent an average of $450 of their own money yearly for school resources. ""You can only imagine -- with tighter school budgets in almost every state this year -- that this number can only get higher,"" said Carmon, the NEA's associate director for teacher quality. Fred Glass, the California Federation of Teachers' communications director, said things could get worse for teachers in the state, with California considering $2.5 billion in mid-year education cuts. Glass said he hopes Farber's ad selling ""will underscore for disinterested observers that this [funding shortfall] can't go on."" Glass said he wouldn't like to see any classroom ads. ""The student needs not to be distracted by anything on the test. This is not instructionally sound,"" he said. But he said he doesn't blame Farber. ""This teacher shouldn't be put in this position,"" Glass said. To those who don't like his idea, Farber suggests asking legislators to better fund education or writing a check to a school. But he said most of the feedback has been positive. ""One person said, 'Too bad you're not a bank, because you might qualify for $700 billion,' "" he said. ""I thought that was pretty clever.""",0.6616341,4210

The actor credits his early years spent at the club with changing the direction of his life. Since 1994, he has served as a volunteer national spokesman for Boys & Girls Clubs of America, appearing in public service announcements on television and in print. He's also a member of the group's board. Denzel Washington says America's leaders need to pay attention to the crisis affecting our children. (CNN) -- With the political season in full swing, much is at stake for America. The economy is in a downward spiral. We have an energy crisis. Our jobless rate is on the rise. These are the subjects that generate headlines and much debate among the candidates. But there is an underlying problem that we as a nation have not addressed, a situation that should concern any American with an eye on the future, regardless of party affiliation. It is the crisis affecting our children: . • Nearly 30 percent of this year's freshman class will drop out of high school, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That number jumps to 40 percent in some urban areas. • The obesity rate for our kids has gone up by as much as 300 percent since 1980, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, triggering a host of health-related problems, from diabetes to heart disease. • Young people account for more than 20 percent of violent crimes in the United States, according to statistics cited by Duke University's Center for Child and Family Policy. Violent juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 4 p.m., at the end of the school day. These facts are grim enough. Factor in persistent patterns of poverty, gang activity, drug abuse and teenage pregnancy, and you have a generation of Americans that will be unprepared -- indeed, unable -- to meet the challenges posed by a complex world. We expect our leaders to lead. But as citizens, we shouldn't simply sit back and hope that politicians stand up to the test.  We can participate in the political process, advocating for policies that will benefit the health, education and well-being of young Americans, because we must do a better job of preparing our youth to lead. It is daunting to think about solving such a widespread crisis. But there are youth-serving organizations that can and do play a key role in effecting positive change -- places such as Boys & Girls Clubs, with a long track record of helping young people turn things around, get an education, lead healthy lives and become effective leaders. I know, because I was one of those kids. Club staff taught me right from wrong and made the lesson stick. They planted the seeds early on that led me to envision myself as a high school graduate, a college graduate and an achiever in whatever field I chose. Boys & Girls Clubs do this today for millions of kids, offering everything from homework help to career exploration, performing a daily miracle that turns hope into opportunity. Urging children and the adults in their lives to ""Be Great,"" these clubs communicate the idea that there is potential for greatness in every child. This powerful call to action reminds us that we can all play a role in helping youth realize their dreams. So I ask you to join me in this effort. There are many ways to help: . • Volunteering at a local youth organization. • Leading by example. • Donating to charities that make a difference. In partnership with government, schools, community leaders and parents, we can create a network and culture in which everyone embraces the importance of a positive future for our youth. But right now, with Election Day fast approaching, ask your local, state and national candidates what they are doing to help our young people become tomorrow's leaders. Ask them to make children a top priority and tell them that you hold them accountable. If we all become advocates for our children, elected officials might just take action. We can do better. And if we care about our nation's future, we must do better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.",0.6614626,978
33,"(Mental Floss) -- For most of us, college donations entail little more than occasionally dropping a small check in the mail after receiving repeated pleas for cash from our alma maters. Some people, though, tend to be a bit more individualistic with their generosity. Let's take a look at some of the quirkier donations schools have received: . 1. Bequest puts jocks on the ropes . In 1907, fledgling Swarthmore College received a bequest that was estimated to be worth somewhere between $1 and $3 million. If the school wanted the cash, though, it would have to stop participating in intercollegiate sports. Swarthmore badly needed the cash -- its entire endowment was only in the $1 million range -- but in the end, the school turned down the gift and the sports survived. 2. Ivy League has to produce homemakers . When former Massachusetts Attorney General A.E. Pillsbury gave Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia $25,000 apiece in his 1931 will, he had a catch in mind: the schools had to use the bequests to combat the feminist movement that had ""already begun to impair the family as the basis of civilization and its advance."" Pillsbury envisioned the schools creating a lectureship that could help keep women in the home. 3. Auburn goes to the dogs . When Miss Eleanor Elizabeth Ritchey, granddaughter of the founder of the Quaker State Oil Refining Company, died in 1968, she left Auburn University a generous gift of $2.5 million. She also gave the school something a bit more unusual: the responsibility for 150 dogs. Ritchey, who owned a ranch in Florida and loved to adopt homeless dogs, made the large cash donation contingent on the school finding good homes for all 150 of her dogs. The cash was then earmarked for veterinary research. Mental Floss: Videos: Dogs welcoming home soldiers . 4. Bryn Mawr goes on the clock . Did Bryn Mawr need any new clocks in 1957? It didn't matter. They were getting one. Philadelphia physician Florence Chapman Child left the school $50,000 in her will if they would also agree to take her 150-year-old grandfather clock. The doctor stipulated that the school's administrators had to ""install it in an appropriate place, keep it in proper condition and repair, make no changes in the fundamental appearance, and are not to have it electrified."" 5. Donor wants flowers in perpetuity . For years, Indiana University offered a scholarship with a strange condition: the recipient was supposed to drive from Bloomington to Indianapolis once a year to put flowers on the donor's grave. The school gradually decided it was a bit much to ask a student to take a roadtrip to a stranger's headstone, though, so for 20 years it didn't enforce the requirement. Eventually the donor's attorney found out that the flowers weren't being placed, but instead of being indignant he worked with the school to remove the clause from the bequest. 6. Colleges find a fountainhead of cash . In 2008, Marshall University received a $1 million gift to establish the BB&T Center for the Advancement of American Capitalism. The catch was that the school had to agree to teach Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" as part of its curriculum. BB&T executives said the requirement was designed to spark debate on the ethical underpinnings of capitalism. This wasn't the first time BB&T had made this sort of gift, either. In 2005, it gave the University of North Carolina Charlotte another million big ones to make ""Atlas Shrugged"" required reading for its students. 7. Small potatoes lead to big cash . In 1950, the government had a surplus of potatoes and started looking for ways to get rid of the excess tubers. The Department of Agriculture decided to give the potatoes to Hiwassee College, a small Methodist school in eastern Tennessee. College president D.R. Youell told the government that he didn't want its charity, though. A short time later, the school received a $10,000 donation with a note praising the institution for taking a stand against ""the dangerous trends toward socialism in our Government."" Mental Floss: 7 College Cheating Scandals . 8. College profits from a racist will . When Dr. Jesse C. Coggins died in 1962, he left his estate to the Keswick nursing home so it could construct a new building. Coggins made a last-minute change to the will, though, that stipulated that the building would only house white patients. In 1999, a court ruled that the racist stipulation effectively voided the gift and gave the entire estate -- which had grown to $28.8 million -- to the will's backup beneficiary, the University of Maryland Medical Center. 9. Donor affects fashion from beyond the grave . Radcliffe once received a piece of jewelry as a bequest. A nice gift, to be sure, but the late donor was a bit bossy. She wasn't just donating the piece of jewelry; she stipulated in the gift that the president of Radcliffe must wear the accessory. 10. Small college enters the Scientific Instrument Business . By the time Erick O. Schonstedt died in 1993, he had built his 40-year-old business, the Schonstedt Instrument Company, into a $6-million-a-year enterprise. There was a problem, though. If he wanted to leave the business to a relative or an employee, the estate taxes would have been nearly $3 million. None of his prospective heirs had that sort of loot on hand. Schonstedt, a University of Minnesota alum, got creative. He gave the company to Augustana College, a school that, like Schonstedt, had Swedish Lutheran affiliations. Rather than simply turning around and flipping the business for cash, though, Augustana decided to run it. The school instituted new sales models, found cost savings, and changed the company's product mix, and after two years was exceeding profit targets by 25 percent. In 2008, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at North Carolina State received a similar gift; a donor left the school controlling interest in a company he had started to raise sturgeon for caviar in North Carolina. 11. A different kind of monument . Back in 2008, writer Katie Kelly covered an interesting donation: . ""Endowing a school, building, or even a classroom with one's name is a pretty typical fundraising practice among universities today. Demanding a bathroom to commemorate yourself isn't quite as common. Brad Feld, a local venture capitalist, donated $25,000 to the University of Colorado on the condition that a plaque would be placed on the door of a second-floor men's restroom in one of the campus' technology centers. He originally made the conditional offer to his alma mater, MIT, but was rejected. ""Feld, in an interview with Boulder's Daily Camera, stated: 'I just wanted a plaque outside of the men's room to inspire people as they walk in to do their business.' Quite fittingly, the quote reads, 'The best ideas often come at inconvenient times -- don't ever close your mind to them.'"" Mental Floss: 11 majors your college probably didn't offer . 12. School doesn't say ""Danke Schoen"" to Wayne Newton . In 1993, Wayne Newton made his first appearance in Branson, Missouri. He offered to give his cut of the first night's show to the nearby College of the Ozarks. It was a pretty generous gift; Newton's take would have ended up being $15,000 to $25,000. Unfortunately, the school's president, Jerry Davis, went to see Newton's set. He was horrified by Newton's double entendres and jokes about the elderly having sex. The next day Davis announced that the school wouldn't accept a cent of Newton's money. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

34,"(CNN) -- When David Green, 22, graduated from Western Washington University in December, he applied for dozens of jobs, from fast food to secretarial positions -- sending out more than 50 resumes and scoring only two interviews in the process. The organization Reach to Teach has seen a 100 percent increase in applications to teach English in Asia. ""It was horrible. I couldn't find anything,"" said Green, a history and social studies major. With few employment options in his hometown of Bellingham, Washington, Green applied to teach English in a South Korean middle school through Reach to Teach, an organization that assists college graduates with finding teaching positions in Asia. Green, who counts trips to Canada as his only experience abroad, will be leaving for Seoul on March 20 for one year. ""I am scared. I've only had one major breakdown so far, ... but I'm really excited about being on my own ... somewhere completely new where I know absolutely no one,"" he said. Like Green, many recent college graduates are searching for alternatives to jumping into the job market in the face of the recession. An increasing number of young Americans are searching out paid positions teaching English in countries like South Korea, Japan, China and Spain as a means to expand their horizons and weather the economic doldrums. Mitch Gordon, director of school relations for Reach to Teach, said his organization has seen more than a 100 percent increase in applications in the last six months, with 3,784 applicants compared to 1,488 during the same six-month period last year. The application system doesn't track U.S. applicants separately, but Gordon estimates more than 70 percent are from the United States. The program also has seen a significant increase in current teachers extending their teaching contracts abroad for an extra year. Gordon said he believes the recession is the primary reason for the steady increase in applicants, and the increase has made the program more competitive. ""We have more people for the same number of positions,"" he said. ""We're able to raise our standards a little bit more."" Japan's JET (Japan Exchange and Teaching) program also has recorded a jump in applicants. For 2009 positions, the Japanese government-sponsored program has received 15 percent more U.S. applications than last year, according to program coordinator Joelle Williams. The program attributes the jump in part to the economic situation and the tough job market in the United States. JET officials also noticed that more applications arrived farther in advance of the deadline this year. 'Taking control of my own life' Ayana Hosten, a spring 2008 graduate of Claremont McKenna College, has been working as an English teaching assistant in Madrid, Spain, since February through a program organized by the Ministry of Education of Spain. Her contract is ending in June and she is already looking to extend her stay for another year. Spain's Ministry of Education has announced more than 1,200 openings for U.S. and Canadian ""cultural ambassadors"" for the 2009-2010 school year. Grants provide the teaching assistants with about $900 a month for the eight-month stay. Teachers are responsible for their own lodging and transportation costs, and applicants should have a functional knowledge of Spanish. For Hosten, 22, going to Spain was a way to escape a rough job market that left her without a full-time job between graduating and applying for the teaching program. ""After being unemployed for three months, it really started to affect me emotionally, which was something I was not prepared for,"" Hosten said in an e-mail. ""Going to Spain was me taking control of my own life and pretty much just wiping my hands of the financial crisis."" Travis Lee, a University of Tennessee alumnus who is in a teaching program sponsored by a university in Wuhan, China, began teaching English in September 2008, originally intending to stay for one year. ""Now I'm thinking of extending my stay for another semester or full year, and if I really like it and can't find a job in America, who knows?"" Lee said in an e-mail. He said the economy and the tight job market have been a big influence in his consideration to stay in China. Trying another path . For many recent graduates, working abroad is becoming a more secure option than searching for a job in the United States. Most teaching programs in other countries will provide teachers with a salary and health insurance, and some programs in Asia will even provide free housing, said Jake Hanin, a teach abroad program coordinator for the Council on International Education Exchange, who also has noticed an increase in applications. For programs in Asia, fluency in English is usually the most important qualification for teaching jobs, and many do not require applicants to have previous teaching experience, Hanin said. Lee's salary in China is approximately $555 per month, which he says is more than enough to live comfortably in Wuhan. The university also provides him with a rent-free apartment and pays his electric bill. ""We make twice what a Chinese teacher with a bachelor's makes and we do half the work,"" Lee said in an e-mail. But for Lee and many other recent graduates, working abroad is primarily about having once-in-a-lifetime experiences in a completely different culture. ""You have plenty of time to get a career, start a family, and follow that path,"" Lee said. ""Why not try another path first? What have you got to lose?""

35,"Washington (CNN) -- All Cedric wanted was lunch. A 14-year old student in a special education classroom in Texas, Cedric was living with a foster family because of a history of neglect, including malnutrition. But on this day in 2002, his teacher tried to punish him by withholding food, despite the abuse he had suffered as a young child. Cedric's teacher delayed his lunch for hours to discipline him for refusing to do his work. When he wouldn't comply, his teacher put him in a face down restraint and sat on him in front of his classmates. Cedric said repeatedly that he could not breathe. He died minutes later on the classroom floor. Cedric's tragic story isn't an isolated case in America's schools today. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, over the last 20 years there have been hundreds of allegations of school personnel using restraint and seclusion in abusive ways on children. It's happening disproportionately to students with disabilities, often at the hands of untrained staff. Many of these students bear haunting physical and emotional scars. And in a number of cases, students have died. It's difficult to believe, but there are no federal laws to prevent this from happening. Local newspapers recount bone-chilling stories of schoolchildren tied to chairs, or with their mouths taped shut, sometimes locked in dark closets, or pinned to the floor for hours at a time. If parents treat their kids this way, it's considered a criminal offense. But unlike in hospitals and other institutions that receive federal taxpayer funding, there are no federal protections against these abusive practices when they happen in schools. The Children's Health Act of 2000 regulates how and when restraint and seclusion can be used in medical settings and community facilities. But classrooms, where students spend the majority of their day, are exempt. In the absence of a federal standard, state protections for kids are all over the map. Many states have no regulations whatsoever. Children are left vulnerable and staff untrained. Restraint and seclusion techniques should be used only as a last resort, when someone is in imminent danger of physical injury and there are no alternatives. Without proper training, staff can be hurt and students, especially small children, are at risk. Yet the GAO and news reports confirm that these practices are used frequently, often as discipline, when students aren't physically aggressive. While there is no centralized reporting, data from the few states that do track incidents paints a troubling picture. In the 2007-2008 school year in California alone, the GAO reports, there were more than 14,300 cases of restraint, seclusion and other ""emergency interventions."" We don't know how many of these merited real emergencies. In one California case, Paige, a young girl with Asperger's syndrome, was restrained in class because she was wiggling her loose tooth. Her mother, who had never consented to physical interventions, had no idea restraint was regularly imposed until her daughter came home with bruises. As parents, when we send our children to school, we expect they will be safe from danger. And when the very people we entrust with our children's well-being inflict this type of abuse, it's not just the victims and their families who suffer. It hurts their classmates, who witness these terrifying events. It undermines the vast majority of teachers and staff who are trying to give students a quality education. It's a nightmare for everyone involved. The easy answer here would be to blame teachers. But it would be the wrong one. Ultimately, the root of this problem has been our system-wide failure to provide direction and enforcement. As long as school systems continue to lack the tools they need to create good policies and properly train staff, these incidents will continue. The solution is a balanced approach to make classrooms safe for students and teachers. With that goal in mind, on Wednesday we are introducing legislation to finally ensure that schools in every state have the resources they need to prevent inappropriate restraint and seclusion. Our bill would set minimum safety standards in schools, similar to the protections children already receive in other institutions, so that states can ensure appropriate school district policies. It would limit physical restraints or locked seclusion to situations involving imminent danger, and require staff to be trained in administering these practices. It would outlaw mechanical restraints, such as strapping kids to chairs, and prohibit restraints that restrict breathing. It will increase transparency and oversight, so we will finally know just how widespread these practices are, and provide the Secretary of Education with tools to enforce the law. And it would give schools the support they need to equip their staff to handle difficult situations in the most positive manner possible. In a time of deep partisan divide, some may wonder what prompted strange bedfellows -- a member of Democratic leadership and a member of Republican leadership -- to team up. It's as simple as this: Schools are places for our children to learn, grow, and thrive. As a nation we must do better. It's time to ensure that no child in this country suffers the same fate as Cedric. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of U.S. Reps.

36,"(CNN) -- Earlier this year, Matt Keller sat down with officials in Afghanistan -- not to discuss troop deployments, suicide bombings or opium traffickers. He was there to talk about getting laptop computers into the hands of little girls. Girls in India take a seat on the floor and get to work on their new laptops. As Taliban insurgents continue to crack down on girls who go to school and women who dare to teach them, Keller was awestruck by the Afghan government's determination to educate all children, even if it means finding tools that allow them to intellectually grow in the privacy of their own homes. ""For them to propose this was astounding,"" said Keller, who works for One Laptop per Child, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, nonprofit committed to creating and distributing affordable, durable and solar-powered laptops to the world's poorest children. ""That hunger for knowledge, that desire to learn, is pretty profound."" From Uruguay, Haiti and Mexico to Mongolia, Ghana and the small Polynesian island of Niue, at least 750,000 kids -- a number that will double by June, Chairman Nicholas Negroponte said -- are tapping away on One Laptop per Child-produced XO laptop keyboards. They're exploring mathematics, composing music and art, learning new languages, designing animation, collecting data, collaborating with peers across borders and accessing learning tools (including textbooks) that they would never see otherwise. Targeting current and historic conflict zones, including Iraq, Rwanda and most recently the Gaza Strip, not only fulfills the group's mission to offer equal-access education to the most isolated children, it may also promote world peace, Keller said. By putting laptops ""into the hands of kids who would otherwise be indoctrinated,"" he explained, ""we can make the case pretty successfully that doing this is a long-term solution to root causes."" When the laptops, which incorporate free wireless Internet connectivity and open-source programming, first rolled out in 2007, they cost $205 each. Now, they're down to $180. The price is higher than Negroponte's original goal of $100 a pop, but it's a figure he believes will keep going down as One Laptop per Child finds ways to engineer the product with fewer components. The hope is that with corporate sponsorships and donations, collected through a program called Give One Get One, the computers can be delivered to kids at no cost to the poorest host-country governments. The laptops allow students to engage in learning differently, enjoy a customized approach and hone critical thinking skills, explained David Cavallo, One Laptop per Child's vice president of learning. And their mere existence, he said, keeps kids coming to school. Cavallo spoke of a school in Rwanda that lacks electricity and traditionally had a 50 percent attendance rate. It is now drawing 1,000 more students than its previous full capacity, he said, and is even attracting kids -- who in turn are teaching their parents and grandparents -- on weekends. ""Rwanda is recovering from genocide,"" he said. This is a ""real engagement of a society directing itself to a different future."" And the kids, no matter their previous exposure to technology, immediately gravitate to the machines. Keller, the group's director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recalled a visit to rural Ethiopia. As he passed out the laptops, he kept one eye on the children, the other on his watch. Seven seconds was all it took for an 8-year-old boy to flip open the never-seen-before computer, find and then hit the power button. Within two weeks, that boy and his classmates would be programming. Meanwhile, the nearby adults stared at the oddball objects and flashed the international look of, ""What the hell is this thing?"" Keller said. ""Kids are technology natives, and adults are technology immigrants."" Despite its ongoing successes, the downturn in the economy has taken a toll on the nonprofit. The last Give One Get One promotion brought in $2.5 million, while the first incarnation brought in $37.5 million, Negroponte said. And corporate sponsors fell from 11 to three in the span of 30 days, he added. Early this year, the organization laid off half of its staff, bringing the total on payroll to just 32. These economic realities, though disappointing, won't impede the mission, said Negroponte, who created One Laptop per Child with others from the MIT Media Lab. Thousands of volunteers around the world offer technical support and training, and serve as translators and programmers. ""If we could get all the children in the world -- 1.2 billion of them between 6 and 12 -- to have a connected laptop, that would be success,"" Negroponte said. ""Roughly half of those children have no electricity at home or school. The poverty is so extreme, and the environmental conditions are so extreme, we have to focus on them."" The push has been to reach out to developing nations, but that hasn't precluded the group from serving American communities that can pursue the program at a scale that makes sense financially. Birmingham City Schools in Alabama, for example, now has 14,000 of the group's laptops in students' hands. Michael Wilson, principal of Glen Iris Elementary School in Birmingham, opened his building's doors last year as the district's pilot school for the free laptop program. ""It's been an overwhelming success at our school,"" which has a poverty rate of 83 percent, Wilson said. Through professional development and a summer camp for kids, the school is learning how to best utilize the computers. And the students, who own their laptops, are learning about responsibility. They're ""totally engaged in what they're doing,"" Wilson said. ""I have kids getting out of cars in the morning with their laptops open."" One of those kids might be Amicah Bitten, a fourth-grader who is using the computer on her own time to learn Spanish with her mother, Kamonia Bates. ""It gets me more interested because she's interested. ... She doesn't put it down,"" said Bates, who used to take her daughter to the library when she needed a computer. ""I like it because people can learn stuff,"" Amicah, 9, said after school. ""You can listen to music. You can take pictures. You can also learn how to make different things. I can learn Spanish. I can learn French. I can learn how to use the keyboard. ... Yes ma'am, my laptop can do many things.""",0.65118206,7186
37,"South Hadley, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The 15-year-old girl who hanged herself last January after enduring months of bullying from schoolmates failed to alert others to her plight, the superintendent of South Hadley Schools said Thursday. The girl, Phoebe Prince, ""was apparently a very private person; she bore a lot without talking to friends or with her parents or with anybody at school,"" Gus Sayer told CNN. ""She didn't reveal to people what she was being subjected to and, unfortunately, until January 7, we were not aware of what she was being subjected to, so [there was] very little way we could have intervened in the bullying."" Sayer cited two incidents that occurred on January 7. In one, a girl walked into a classroom and called Prince ""an Irish slut,"" he said. The name caller was taken to the principal's office and disciplined, he said. In the other, a girl ""said something threatening about Phoebe"" to another girl, he said. A staff member overheard the comment and reported it to the principal, who took disciplinary action, Sayer said. He said it was school policy not to specify what disciplinary actions may have been taken against any individual student, though he said the latter case did not include expulsion and that the student returned to school. ""To our knowledge the action taken was effective in ending their involvement in any bullying of Phoebe,"" he said. Prince, who had recently moved with her family from Ireland to South Hadley, hanged herself on January 14 after enduring what Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth B. Scheibel described to reporters Monday as ""a nearly three-month campaign of verbally assaultive behavior and threats of physical harm toward Phoebe, on school grounds, by several South Hadley High School students."" Six students were named in an indictment returned by a grand jury Friday and made public Monday. In addition, Scheibel said three female students received juvenile charges, but she would not clarify if they were among the six named in the indictment. That left even Sayer confused. ""There could be as many as nine, but I believe that six"" is the correct number, he said. Though authorities did not consider that the actions or failures to act by the faculty, staff and administrators of the school amounted to criminal behavior, prosecutor Scheibel called for them to undergo training to learn to intervene more effectively in such cases. But administrators in the school district, who oversee the education of 2,100 students in four schools, are being unfairly blamed for the death, Sayer said. Those critics include a number of parents who have demanded that the administrators resign. ""They really don't know what's going on in the schools, but they feel that this shouldn't have happened and that, somehow, it has to be the fault of the schools themselves,"" Sayer said. ""Frankly, I think that grossly oversimplifies the situation."" Sayer said he had received hundreds of vituperative messages from the community. ""They are awful,"" he said, citing one that said he should be ""burning in hell."" He said he was trying to ignore them. None of the six students identified in the indictment remains in school, he added. Sayer said he supported the punishments meted out to the students. ""If they, as they have been charged, committed crimes, they should face the consequences for those crimes,"" he said. But, he added, expulsion is something educators are reluctant to countenance. ""It's a terrible punishment because that changes their whole lives and what they are capable of doing, and they have to figure out a way to renew and complete their education.""

38,"Macon, Georgia (CNN) -- Bettye Webb-Hayes won't ever forget the day her son posed a question that stopped her in her tracks. ""Mom,"" the fourth-grader asked, ""am I white?"" It was a question she had never asked her own parents. It was something you didn't talk about in the days of the segregated South -- especially when your mom was white and your father was a mix of African-American and Native American. She went to the black schools of Macon, Georgia. Now, her son was asking probing questions. ""Why would you ask me that?"" she said. ""Because everybody at school calls me a honky,"" said the young Cordell, a light-skinned African-American. Twenty-seven years have passed since that conversation. Bettye and her son recently traveled back to Macon to face something that's been omnipresent their whole lives: the coming together of white and black. They returned for a one-of-a-kind 50th high school gathering. The classes of 1959, once segregated by race as well as gender, sat down together for the first time in history. Ruby Dean Dupree Mayes arrived two hours early for the festivities. She didn't sleep the night before. ""It's like waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. I'm so excited,"" said Mayes, who drove more than 330 miles from Tennessee to attend. Mayes went to Ballard-Hudson High, the city's black high school, whose most famous students include singers Otis Redding and Little Richard. She came this day ""to celebrate and commemorate."" ""I could not pass this event up,"" she said. ""I never dreamed of this moment -- just the realization of knowing that we had come together, at last."" As the 1959 graduates arrived, they welcomed one another. Many first greeted people of their own race. Some hadn't seen particular classmates in the 50 years since they earned their diplomas. Gradually, they began mixing and mingling. There was a commonality -- a need to come together for their children, their grandchildren and the generations to follow. Discuss the past, while moving forward in the present. Separated now by 'personal choice' It sometimes takes a son to see things in a new light. The idea for the meeting began four years ago, when a son told his father: ""Dad, think about how many friends you missed getting to know."" Those were the words of Wyatt Johnson, a public school teacher in Santa Cruz, California. He and his father, Tom Johnson, were enjoying a father-son trip to Macon in 2005 to rediscover their roots. Tom Johnson is the former head of CNN and was once the publisher of the Los Angeles Times. He's traveled the world and left his own mark along the way. Yet despite all his accomplishments, there was something he'd never done: reach out to the African-Americans of Macon from 1959, the ones he never knew because of segregation. An idea was born. He wrote to graduates of the black school, Ballard-Hudson; the white girls' school, Miller; and the white boys' school, Lanier. ""We all have deep personal memories of our high school experiences that will remain with us forever,"" he wrote. ""We had lived in a separate black and white world in Macon. ... It is a different world today. We no longer are separated, except by personal choice."" One white graduate responded with hate mail, a reminder that racism still exists. But on a day in early October, more than 200 people gathered at a Goodwill banquet hall. There was no shouting, none of the in-your-face name-calling seen in recent health care town hall meetings across the country. Here, there were tears, hugs and handshakes. Often, talk of grandkids took center stage at the 16 roundtables. They talked about race and the segregated past that prevented such closeness a half-century ago. ""You'd think we'd have grown up together,"" said Alice Bailey, a Ballard-Hudson grad. ""We still have a gift, and that's a gift of time,"" Johnson said. ""Blacks and whites together, we can do something to make the world better."" They took out notepads. They scribbled ways to take action. They began making a to-do list of 59 things for the Classes of 1959. Their goals range from building a home for Habitat to Humanity to writing letters to service men and women from Macon serving in war. They'd love to persuade the one who sent the hate mail to attend the next gathering. They also want to set an example for the elders of other Southern cities. ""I'm glad we've left the past behind,"" said Michael Cass, the 1959 class president of Lanier. The daughter of one those in attendance stood and took the microphone. ""Today, you have inspired me so much,"" she said. Many in the crowd reached for tissues. Linda Carstarphen Gugin said her whole life had been leading to this moment. ""It was the most amazing thing,"" she said. ""It was just like almost immediate bonding between people."" As the class president of Miller, she'd carried guilt for the last 50 years for not speaking out against segregation. ""I have tears about this,"" she said, crying. For Bettye Webb-Hayes and her son, the gathering underscored why the question ""Mom, am I white"" could be asked in one era and not another. Listening to his mother and her childhood friends, Cordell said, he was struck by how segregation was ""was so transparent to them at the time they were living through it. It was a way of life, so they didn't acknowledge its existence."" ""I find it interesting how human nature teaches you to accept things that are -- and some people question the reality, and other people don't."" His mother did test the reality of segregation on one occasion. Bettye and her sister went into a Woolworth's department store in Macon. They sat at a counter for food. The white waitress looked at them skeptically. She couldn't tell whether they were white or black. She grabbed a black cook for his input. ""Those are the Webb girls,"" he said. The two were kicked out. Webb-Hayes giggles about the story. She's proud she tried to break the rules. ""I think she really would've served us if she thought she could have gotten away with it."" Watch Bettye tell story of her dad and 'stupid' Elvis . It was in 1963 when Webb-Hayes realized just how wrong the segregated South was. She marched in Washington, D.C., with Martin Luther King Jr. that year. ""It was almost like you were listening to God speak in person."" Years later, Bettye -- the girl who was sent away from the Woolworth's counter -- would eat Thanksgiving dinner with President Jimmy Carter. Webb-Hayes was the music teacher for Amy Carter, the president's daughter. Her motto throughout life: ""Just do the very best you can."" She calls the gathering of the segregated schools ""unbelievable."" If it's the last trip of her life, Webb-Hayes, 68, feels her life's journey is now complete.

39,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Jaime Escalante, the math teacher portrayed in the 1988 film ""Stand and Deliver,"" died Tuesday after a battle with cancer, according to the actor who played him. Escalante, 79, was surrounded by his wife, children and grandchildren when he died at his home in Roseville, California, said Edward James Olmos. Olmos visited Escalante's bedside Monday night, he said. ""We lost one of the true giants of education and inspiration in this country,"" Olmos said. ""He really made us understand that it didn't matter what color, race, creed or ethnicity any of us are."" Olmos disclosed earlier this month that Escalante was ""seriously ill"" with cancer and needed help paying for his medical care. He held a fundraiser in Los Angeles, California, for him last week. ""Stand and Deliver"" told the inspirational story of how Escalante turned the failing calculus program at Garfield High School in east Los Angeles into one of the top in the nation. The movie depicted events of 1982 when his inner-city student's test scores were questioned by officials. Those who were retested had their passing scores reinstated. Escalante became a hero for educators, earning him entrance to the National Teachers Hall of Fame and the Presidential Medal for Excellence in Education. ""During his tenure at Garfield High School, many of our students excelled in learning, aspired to a higher education and went on to become very successful in various careers,"" Los Angeles School Superintendent Ramon Cortines said. ""Today, they are living testaments to a teacher who demonstrated how high expectations coupled with constant support can overcome obstacles to a quality education."" The Garfield High math program floundered after Escalante left in 1991 for a teaching job in Sacramento, California. He also hosted a PBS television series that promoted math and science careers. He retired from teaching and returned to Bolivia in 1999, where he was born in 1930. Escalante recently returned to California for medical treatment.

40,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Demonstrators entered their third day of a building takeover at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday in protest of a tuition increase, an undertaking that a school spokesman called futile. The occupation of Kerr Hall is just one of several demonstrations across University of California campuses this week after the regent's board approved a 32 percent increase in tuition Thursday. University officials said the $505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made due to California's persistent financial crisis. Protesting students said the increase will hurt working and middle-class students who benefit from state-funded education. On the Santa Cruz campus, where building occupations began last week with a library sit-in, about 100 students staged a sit-in in the second-floor lobby of Kerr Hall soon after hearing that the tuition increase had been approved, according to UC Santa Cruz Provost David Kliger. The students made a list of 20 ""demands"" detailing how they want the administration to increase funding, spokesman Barry Shiller said. But the school has no plans to negotiate the demands with the student body, he said. The school just doesn't have the money, he added. School officials hope the students realize that their demonstration is ""not accomplishing anything"" and is ""just a disruption"" to administrative duties on campus, he said. The administration will continue to wait out the takeover, but Shiller said he is unsure of how long it will last. The school hopes the students will leave voluntarily, he said. Are you there? Share your story, video . Meanwhile, uprisings on other campuses have quieted since earlier mass demonstrations. At UC Berkeley on Friday night, 41 protesters occupying a building were arrested. Authorities decided to cite them for trespassing and release them rather than take them to jail, per an agreement with student leaders, school spokeswoman Claire Holmes said. Three students were arrested there Friday morning. Fifty-two students were arrested at UC Davis late Thursday after they refused to vacate the school's administration building. And UCLA's Campbell Hall was occupied for several hours Thursday evening. The angry students are condemning a nearly $2,000 tuition increase. The first change, which takes effect in January, will raise undergraduate tuition to $8,373. The second increase kicks in next fall, raising tuition to $10,302, university spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka said. Students who live on campus could pay an estimated $17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing, according to the system's July 2008 finance guide. The January increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition increase last year. On average, tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide increased 6.5 percent, or to $7,020, since the previous school year, according to data from College Board. Students eligible for financial aid and whose families make less than $70,000 will have their tuition covered, the university said.",0.64621943,8046
41,"(CNN) -- Walking into school Wednesday morning was not easy for Constance McMillen. The last time she'd been there was March 11, the day after her Fulton, Mississippi, high school canceled prom rather than allow her to wear a tuxedo and attend with her girlfriend. She didn't assume last week's spring break would cool things down. She expected stares, dirty looks and cold shoulders, and passing through the doors was daunting. Over these last two weeks, she said, she's had a hard time sleeping, can barely eat, feels anxious and -- until she saw a doctor for help -- often felt like she was ""going to throw up."" ""I've been very nervous about all of this,"" the 18-year-old Itawamba Agricultural High School senior said. ""I don't like being somewhere where everyone hates me."" McMillen's name made national headlines when she, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, filed suit against her school and the Itawamba County School District, asking them to reinstate prom for everyone, without discrimination. A federal judge in Mississippi ruled Tuesday that while he wouldn't force the school to have a prom, which had originally been scheduled for April 2, he agreed that McMillen's First Amendment rights had been violated. That was good news, said her attorney, Christine Sun, senior counsel with the ACLU's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender project. It set a precedent and helped broadcast an important statement, which was made stronger by virtue of where it came from, she said. ""We're in a conservative area of the country, where people tend to think we can do what we like,"" said Sun, who lives in New York but has traveled multiple times to Mississippi for this legal push. ""This case sends a strong message that that's not going to fly anymore."" The only pending issue, Sun said, is the question of damages and the ACLU's request for attorneys' fees. An amended complaint to seek a quick resolution on this should be filed in the next 30 days, she said. Meantime, McMillen is trying to find her new normal. In many ways, she stands in an awkward balance. Though there are some people who support her in Fulton (population about 4,000), the overarching tension and what she described as ""hostility"" that she feels at school and in her community is in deep contrast to the reception and groundswell of support that's overwhelmed her nationally. As a poster child for the rights of LGBT students, she's been asked to jump on airplanes to appear on news programs and talk shows. The Facebook fan page ""Let Constance Take Her Girlfriend to Prom!"" had attracted more than 414,000 fans as of Friday morning. Wealthy individuals, including Ellen DeGeneres, have offered to pay for a prom for her school. She's received a $30,000 college scholarship from an anonymous donor and Tonic.com, a digital media company in New York that's also offered her a summer internship. She's even been invited to high school proms in cities she's never visited. ""It means a lot to me,"" she said of the outreach from others. ""The amount of support helps me to continue with the fight."" But all McMillen, who came out as a lesbian in eighth grade, ever wanted was to go to her school prom with her class, and with her girlfriend. Going to another school's prom, while a nice offer, doesn't make any sense to her. Parents at her school are reportedly planning a ""ball"" for the same night that prom was intended. McMillen said she's still trying to find out if she's free to attend with her girlfriend. She won't go otherwise. She never meant to be a spoiler for others when she sought approval to bring her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo, she said. She thought she was doing the right thing by asking in advance, since the school had stipulated in a February memo that dates must be of the opposite sex.

42,"(CNN) -- Dan Godshall and 21 other students at Slippery Rock University will not be allowed to graduate at their school's main ceremony because they recently visited Mexico. Dan Godshall was worried at first about telling his mother he wasn't able to be at the main graduation. The students, who returned this week after student teaching in Mexico, came back to the United States early because they were worried the border would be closed and they'd miss out on walking at their graduation. But now, they'll be walking in their own graduation, without any of their classmates, because the college feared they made have been exposed to the H1N1 flu outbreak in Mexico. ""At first I was like, no way, no way,"" Godshall told CNN. ""I had the irrational, 15-minute oh my God, oh my God, I can't go to my graduation."" The students got the news from the school and received an e-mail from the university's vice president explaining the change. ""The university has received hundreds of calls from students and parents who were worried about being exposed at the commencement ceremonies,"" the e-mail said. ""We have an obligation to protect others from what they perceive is possible exposure to this virus."" When he heard the news, Godshall was worried about how he would tell his mother that she wouldn't get to see him walk across the stage with the pomp and circumstance that everyone else will have. ""I thought my mom was going to freak,"" he said. iReport.com: How should we handle swine flu . Senior Ryan Brisini said at first when he found out that he couldn't walk, he was ""a little irked."" ""But we are a liability, and if you are going to try and do the best thing for the school and the entire graduation ceremony, we probably shouldn't be there,"" he said. So Brisini and Godshall took the news in stride. The 22 students will get a ceremony unlike anyone else in the school -- and the main graduation will see a video of their ceremony. ""It makes us a little distinguished from the group,"" Godshall said. ""We were already the Mexican group, the swine flu zombies, now it gives us something positive and everyone has to watch our ceremony."" And with a small ceremony, only attended by the 22 students, their family and friends and university officials, senior Ryan Brisini thinks it will be more memorable. He won't have to sit next to a bunch of people he won't know, and he won't have to endure the lingering theatrics of a regular ceremony. ""I think its kind of cool because when you are with people for an entire month you bond with them, and I can say I'm genuinely excited for everyone graduating, whereas at the main graduation I'd be with a bunch of kids I don't know,"" he said. ""With this I can clap and cheer for everyone and genuinely be happy for them."" Still, some students are upset they will miss out on the grandiose day. John Powell, who also went on the trip, told CNN affiliate WTAE-TV that the whole reason the group left early was so they could attend. ""It hits me a little bit. It's a necessary evil, separating us. I don't agree with it totally, but I'm not in too big of a position to overturn it,"" Powell said.  Watch Slippery Rock students tell their story » . WTAE reported the  university, in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, says it has received hundreds of calls from concerned people. ""There are concerns from the public perspective that they will be exposed,"" university spokeswoman Rita Abent told WTAE. ""They may boo them. They may get up and walk out. And graduation should be a very respectful and a very celebratory time."" Slippery Rock University isn't the only school making changes to graduation ceremonies because of swine flu fears. Cisco Junior College in West Central Texas is canceling Friday graduation ceremonies. Students will get their diplomas by mail, the college said. ""We understand that many will be disappointed by our decision,"" college President Colleen Smith said in a statement. ""However, we believe that it is more important to protect our students, employees and families than to proceed with graduation ceremonies at this time."" Graduates at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, will get diplomas at commencement ceremonies Saturday but will have to live without part of the day's tradition. ""Since direct contact is one of the ways flu viruses spread, we have decided to forgo the traditional congratulatory handshake as you come forward to receive your diploma and have your photo taken with your dean,"" the school told students in a letter posted on its Web site. Across the country thousands of elementary, middle and high school students are feeling the impact too. At least four high schools have canceled their proms this weekend, including Park City High School in Park City, Utah, according to CNN affiliate KSL-TV. Senior Kelly McGuire, who was getting ready for the prom on Saturday, is making last-minute changes because of the rescheduling. ""That's a bummer, because it means we have to try to cancel our limo,"" McGuire told KSL-TV. ""All cancellations have to be a week in advance. I have to cancel my tux, my corsage. It's going to be hectic."" The Department of Education said that as of noon on Friday 433 schools, with a total of 245,449 students, in 17 states have been closed. Fort Worth schools will be closed at least until May 12, authorities said, announcing that one student was confirmed to have swine flu. The closure affects about 80,000 students. Texas school officials have postponed all interscholastic sports until at least May 11. Alabama has taken a similar step, stopping competitions until at least Tuesday. In Montgomery County, Maryland, 1,250-student Rockville High School joined the closed list Friday when state health authorities closed it until further notice because of a suspected swine flu case. There, too, athletics were taking a big hit, Assistant Principal Dyan Gomez said. Rockville's teams were even banned from traveling to other schools to compete this weekend, she said.

Born in a fishing village in Japan, Fujiyama, 25, recalls a childhood dominated by health concerns. Doctors told his parents that he had a hole in his heart and ""they didn't think I had lot longer to live."" But during a later visit to the doctor, Fujiyama says, his family learned the hole had closed. ""Somehow I was cured and I became a normal kid,"" Fujiyama says. ""And I had a second chance."" During his sophomore year at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, he volunteered in Honduras with a campus group and was struck by the extreme poverty he saw -- barefoot children collecting cans and sleeping in the streets. Fujiyama says he realized he could help give other children their own second chance.

Fujiyama says students are deeply committed to the organization because they are involved on every level: They raise money and then travel to Honduras to help build houses. ""We make friends with all the kids, all the families -- no matter where we're from. We've had people from all over the world come to Honduras with us.

45,"Editor's note: Leonard Pitts Jr., a columnist for The Miami Herald, won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary and is the author of a new novel, ""Before I Forget"" and ""Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood."" Leonard Pitts says we know what it takes to improve the performance of African-American students. (CNN) -- Back in 1972, on an episode of ""All in the Family,"" Gloria posed the following riddle to Archie and Meathead. Father and son go driving. There's an accident. The father is killed instantly, the son is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. The surgeon walks in, takes one look at the patient and says, ""I can't operate on this boy. He's my son."" The answer to the apparent paradox eluded Archie, Meathead and the guys down at Kelsey's bar for the balance of the half hour. They floated theories involving stepfathers, sons-in-law, priests, adoptions and returns from the dead. All of which Archie apparently found more believable than the true answer which was, of course, that the surgeon was the boy's mother. ""If that's the answer,"" he spouted, ""that's the dumbest riddle I ever hoid!"" Thirty-seven years later it is, perhaps, difficult to appreciate why this riddle ever was a riddle, how so apparent an answer could have stymied Archie, Meathead and, I would wager, the vast majority of the viewing audience. The riddle speaks volumes not just about how the world has changed in four decades, but also about how unconscious expectations can blind us to the obvious. In 1972, one expected a man when one heard the word ""surgeon."" Much as, in 2009, one expects a white kid when one hears the word ""scholar."" People will deny this, will say all the right and politic things. But the disclaimers will be as thin and transparent as Saran Wrap. Black, white and otherwise, we are all socialized by the same forces and all carry, by and large, the same unconscious assumptions. One of which is that a certain level of achievement is black and another is white. This is what you are hearing when a black kid speaks standard English and another black kid chides him for ""talking white."" This is what George W. Bush was alluding to when he decried ""the soft bigotry of low expectations."" And this is what we need to address forthrightly if we ever hope to close the so-called achievement gap that looms between black kids and white ones. In 2007 and 2008, I traveled the country for a series of columns called ""What Works,"" aimed at profiling programs that addressed that gap. I traveled between big programs and small ones, from the Harlem Children's Zone, which encompasses 90 square blocks of holistic education, family counseling, medical care and tutoring in New York City, to the Freedom Project in Sunflower County, Mississippi, which offers field trips, martial arts and academic enrichment in a rural county where the median income is $25,000 a year and the teen pregnancy rate is said to be 25 percent. I toured Self Enhancement Inc. in Portland, Oregon, a KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) School in Gaston, North Carolina, the East Lake Foundation in Atlanta, Georgia, and many others. In all these places, I saw black kids -- well-spoken, clean-cut and noon-sun bright -- making a lie out of other peoples' expectations. Over the course of 13 months, common themes began to emerge whenever I would ask why kids such as these were doing such wondrous work in these places and substandard work elsewhere. We have more power to fire bad teachers and reward good ones, they said. We require parental involvement. We have a longer school day and a longer school year. We mentor children that need it. We counsel children and families that need it. We are invested in them and make sure they know it. Most of all, they spoke of the simple power of expectation: making it a conscious point to look for greatness in black kids in whom people had not thought to look for it before. What I came to understand in those interviews is that we already know the secret to improving academic performance for African-American children. What is missing is the will to do so. And that, I think, is because where they are concerned, we have other expectations. I asked Geoffrey Canada, founder of the Harlem Children's Zone, how he justifies asking for money to uplift poor kids in Harlem. His response struck me: ""Someone's yelling at me because I'm spending $3,500 a year on `Alfred.' 'Alfred' is 8. OK, Alfred turns 18. No one thinks anything about locking him up for 10 years at $60,000 a year."" But then, we expect Alfred to be locked up, don't we? Expect it so blithely that we will not challenge the expectation even when it works against our own economic self-interest. Canada, after all, presents a rather stark choice: invest a smaller amount early and produce a citizen who pays taxes and contributes to the system or pay a much larger amount later for the upkeep of a citizen who consumes tax monies and contributes nothing. That we consistently choose the latter says something about how we assess the educability, the salvageability, of African-American kids. Thirteen months of interviewing young scholars left me more impatient than ever with a culture that writes off black kids because they are black kids. Somewhere between the 13-year-old in rural Mississippi who wants to go to Harvard and the second-graders in Harlem studying Vincent Van Gogh, I ceased being surprised and started being angry that what I saw was still the exception and not the rule. Everywhere I went, there were black kids excelling. And at some point, you say to yourself: well, of course. What did you expect? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leonard Pitts Jr.",0.6355778,6856
46,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. schoolchildren still have work to do when it comes to mathematics, the secretary of education said Wednesday. Education Secretary Arne Duncan says U.S. schools need to be better equipped to teach math. Arne Duncan, releasing a report on the Department of Education's latest examination of how well American children are doing in mathematics, said no one should be satisfied with what it found. ""Today's results are evidence that we must better equip our schools to improve the knowledge and skills of America's students in mathematics,"" he said. ""More must be done to narrow the troubling achievement gap that has persisted in mathematics, and to ensure that America's students make greater gains toward becoming competitive with their peers in other countries."" Fourth- and eighth-grade students from more than 7,000 public and private schools nationwide were tested by the National Assessment of Educational Progress for the report, titled ""The Nation's Report Card: Mathematics 2009."" Massachusetts students had the highest marks at both grade levels. Other high-performing states were Minnesota, Vermont, New Hampshire and New Jersey. The area with the lowest marks in both grades was the District of Columbia, though the report showed that the district -- along with Nevada, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont -- had improved its scores since the last tests were taken in 2007. The average scores were categorized at each grade level into four groups: below basic, basic, proficient, and advanced. According to the Department of Education, some of the skills required to achieve a basic level of understanding of mathematics at the fourth-grade level include performing simple computations with whole numbers; showing understanding of fractions and decimals; and solving simple real-world problems. To achieve a basic level of understanding at the eighth-grade level, students must be able work with whole numbers, decimals, fractions and percentages; be able to solve word problems and use diagrams, charts and graphs; and be able to solve simple algebra and geometry problems. Scores were slightly higher in the 2009 report than they were in 2007, but Duncan said more needs to be done. ""Our students need to graduate high school ready to succeed in college and the workplace,"" he said. The National Assessment of Educational Progress results ""are a call to action to reform the teaching and learning of mathematics and other related subjects in order to prepare our students to compete in the global economy.""",0.6345049,7208

The story of the Wanless family is the story of a family doing muscle-aching work just to scratch out a living. It's the story of a family that needed a break. Wanless and his parents had recently moved into a camper on their ranch, after losing their home to foreclosure, according to neighbor Erv Figert. A sign with chipped off green lettering sits in the grass at the entrance to the Wanless property. ""There was a sign out there that said 'the ranch that God built,' "" said Joe Prue, father of Mike Prue. ""And for a while there you thought, where was God when everything was coming apart. And now, maybe God helped them."" Neighbors say they have not seen anyone come or go from the Wanless Ranch after Neal briefly emerged at a press conference last week to accept a giant-sized check from the May 27 drawing. For now, the gate to the Wanless ranch is held tight by a new lock, linking a rusted-brown chain. Rumors travel through the green fields of South Dakota faster than the Internet. Talk is cheap with millions of dollars to loosen the tongues. Many believe the Wanless family is going to buy a place up north, maybe by Pierre, but the cowboy with the big heart isn't talking. ""That grin you saw on his face on television (when Wanless accepted the check) is always there,"" said Linster. ""He always looked like he was probably up to something."" Now he has the money to do something about it.",0.63408,5110
48,"(CNN) -- When Autumn Preble was a teenager in the 1960s, she spent hours gazing at black-and-white LIFE magazine photographs that documented the journey of Peace Corps volunteers all over the world. George Stouter, 67, is helping build mental health programs in Saint Kitts for his Peace Corps stint. Preble, of Whidbey Island, Washington, wanted to join, but after college came marriage and a child. Now at 58, with her son off to college, she has begun her two-year stint as a Peace Corps volunteer working in the public health sector in Francistown, Botswana, where nearly one in four individuals are infected with HIV. ""I'm getting to experience what it's like to live in another culture, and that has a lot of value to me,"" Preble said from her simple two-bedroom bungalow in Botswana. Preble is known to natives in her community as Masego (Ma say ho), which means ""many gifts."" ""This is the kind of travel that I'm interested in."" Forget the mapped-out cruises or packaged vacations to see the world. A growing number of Americans over 50 are dedicating time in their golden years to volunteering abroad. The decision is becoming more attractive with a sickly national economy sparking more layoffs and early retirement packages. ""The economic crisis is giving them an opportunity to take a break,"" said Vanessa Noel, an associate director in the nonprofit department of Alliance Abroad Group. The Austin, Texas-based company offers work, teaching and volunteer programs to students and graduates in the U.S. and abroad. Noel coordinates volunteer trips abroad that typically last between two and 12 weeks. Inquiries from eager adults over 50 have flooded her office in recent months -- so much so that she is creating new programs this summer to Costa Rica and Ecuador tailored to older volunteers that will last several weeks. ""Life is short, and now they can seize the opportunities out there."" Applications for the Peace Corps from adults over 50 have spiked 44 percent in 2008 compared to 2007, driven largely by the weak economy and a campaign launched in 2007 to lure mature volunteers. All applicants to the Peace Corps -- a federal program created in 1961 that puts Americans overseas in places of need -- must pass background checks and a health test. Married couples are allowed to join together. By the end of 2008, there were 428 Peace Corps volunteers over age 50 in the field in countries all over the world, from South Africa and Romania to the Eastern Caribbean, challenging the traditional image of the 20-something, post-college volunteer.  See the stories of Americans over 50 who have volunteered abroad » . Other nonprofit groups specializing in shorter ""voluntourism"" trips also are seeing a spike in interest. For those unable to leave for the 27 months required by intensive volunteer programs like the Peace Corps, these paid programs last from a week to a year. Cross-Cultural Solutions, a nonprofit in New York that offers volunteer trips to countries like Russia and Peru from one to 12 weeks, experienced more than a 10 percent growth in volunteers over 50 in 2008, compared with 2007, according to company officials. San Francisco, California-based Global Services Corps, a nonprofit that coordinates service trips to Thailand, Tanzania and Cambodia for stays from two weeks to a year, saw a 25 percent jump in information requests from older Americans after the stock market tanked in October. Older volunteers have long donated time to volunteering abroad, perhaps most famously President Jimmy Carter's mother, Lillian Carter, who applied to the Peace Corps at age 68. As global health and economic issues abroad have become more publicized in an increasingly connected world, older Americans venturing overseas hope they can serve some of the poorest communities in the world while improving the tarnished American image abroad. Many older Americans, like Preble, say they are volunteering abroad in response to President John F. Kennedy's inspiring words from their younger years, asking them to serve their country. Now, they finally have the time. ""They have had a pretty lifelong pattern of community activism, so it makes perfect sense that as they approach the retirement years, they will do a lot of volunteering abroad,"" said Linda George, a professor of sociology specializing in aging at Duke University. Some volunteers also say they are motivated by President Obama's call for change. This month, Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which will pour an estimated $6 billion into volunteerism, including programs for older adults and retirees. Mary Hecht, 66, and her husband Norman Hecht, 68, left their cozy home in New Jersey to embark on a one-week trip this month to save the giant tortoises in the Galapagos Islands. In the midst of packing, she said she is excited to stay with a host family and learn more about the native food and culture. ""I think the older you get, the more set in your ways you become,"" said Hecht, who worked in the education sector for most of her career. ""I think the trip will teach me to be flexible and roll with the punches."" While many volunteers over 50 say there are some drawbacks to volunteering later in life -- such as missing their children and grandchildren back at home --there are many advantages, too. Mature volunteers bring with them valuable life and career experiences, and many countries tend to pay more respect to older people. ""The kinds of things they are struggling with in terms of creating programs are exactly the sorts of things I was previously involved with,"" said 67-year-old Peace Corps volunteer George Stouter, who started in Saint Kitts in the West Indies last fall. He consults on mental health initiatives at a local boys hospital, among many other projects. Stouter worked as a psychiatric social worker in Michigan for 35 years. Greg O'Neill, director of the National Academy on an Aging Society, added that Americans are retiring earlier and living longer, which lends more time to volunteering or making a career change. Darlene Grieger, an 81-year-old grandmother from Arizona, says there are no limits with age. In March 2007, she bid farewell to her five children and 14 grandchildren and went on her first volunteer trip to Costa Rica -- thanks to money donated by her family -- where she volunteered at an orphanage for three months. There, younger volunteers on her program usually called her ""grandmom,"" she said, chuckling. Last fall, she jetted off to Thailand for six weeks to work with a women's group. She did find time to do touristy things between her volunteer duties: Before coming back to the states, she flew on her own to Cambodia to catch a glimpse of Angkor Wat, one of the most famous temples in the world. ""I couldn't even imagine just going on a trip,"" said Grieger, who is planning on selling her home so she can continue volunteering abroad. ""That has to be so boring.""",0.63138074,6366
49,"SOWETO, South Africa (CNN) -- It's late Sunday morning inside a cavernous Salvation Army Church in Soweto, South Africa. Services, complete with African and traditional music, have just finished and a catchy drum beat with a distinctly American hip-hop sound is coming from the stage. Laura DiFilippi, 12, gets ready to board the bus in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to go to the airport. The group of teenagers dancing around the drums is 8,000 miles and an 18-hour plane ride from their New York home. They are mostly from Bushwick, Brooklyn -- a community of about 109,000 people only five miles from Manhattan. For some of these kids, it's their first time away from home. Unfamiliar with Bushwick? It's mostly a working class neighborhood where families have often struggled. For years it was a community with a thriving drug trade, severely under-achieving schools, extreme poverty and a staggering rate of teenage pregnancy. It was ravaged by fires and looting during the summer of 1977 and hit hard by the crack epidemic in the 1980s. Bushwick is recovering now, but half of the children under age 18 still live below the poverty line. A quarter of the adults never make it past the ninth grade and more than half never graduate from high school. The children on this trip to South Africa are what educators and social workers call ""at-risk"" -- at risk of having babies as teenagers; at risk of never finishing high school or achieving their dreams; at risk of never knowing the world beyond their neighborhood. Thirty of these children, between the ages of 12 to 16, have been paired up with college-aged mentors and brought to South Africa by Malaak Compton-Rock, the wife of comedian Chris Rock. She brought them to volunteer -- to serve the impoverished and the AIDS orphans in this country with the highest HIV-infected population in the world. Watch the kids' video diaries from South Africa » . Compton-Rock has carved her own niche in espousing service -- giving back. She often quotes her mentor Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund: ""Service is the rent we pay for living."" The South Africa trip is Compton-Rock's brainchild -- to broaden the horizons of young teens and give them perspective on their own lives.  Watch: The kids witness devastating effect of AIDS in South Africa » . ""I believe by traveling you open up your life,"" Compton-Rock tells a crowd gathered for a press conference the morning after the group has arrived. ""You don't think locally, you start to think globally and internationally and I think it gives you a sense of confidence."" She also wants the children to know, ""that in the United States of America, even in Bushwick, we have certain services that I want the children to understand that they need to take advantage of."" Compton-Rock is talking about access to free public education, food, knowledge and social mobility -- elusive things for South Africa's impoverished and particularly so for 1.4 million AIDS orphans there. One of the mentors on this trip is 20-year-old Alicia Gerald. ""I know that in my own experience,"" Alicia says. ""Just having someone put their hand out and say 'I believe that you can be great,' has really helped me rise to those expectations.""  Photos: Meet some of the kids » . Alicia is from Bedford-Stuyvesant, a troubled community just blocks away from Bushwick. It's also where Compton-Rock's husband grew up. Compton-Rock has required all of the children selected for the trip to sign one-year contracts to become ""global ambassadors."" As ambassadors they are required to tell their friends and neighbors about their experiences -- through writing, blogging, photographs and speeches. The idea, Compton-Rock explains, is that if a child is given a unique opportunity, she or he, is ""obligated to bore a hole and take someone through with you."" Among the children on Compton-Rock's ""Journey for Change"" mission is Laura DiFilippi, a quiet girl who's overcome a lot of challenges in her 12 years. Constant moving and instability in her family life meant it was tough to find the documents needed for travel. For a while, it seemed as thought she wouldn't be able to get her U.S. passport. With the help of Compton-Rock's assistant, Cece Falls, Laura got the paperwork done and her passport was issued just 24 hours before the kids piled onto the bus for the airport. There is also 15-year-old Jeremy Baker, with a broad smile and slight frame. He is growing up in the projects with four siblings and hits the basketball courts every morning before breakfast during the summer. His dream? ""Senior year I'd get a scholarship to Connecticut, UConn, play there,"" says Jeremy. ""Then, like after my sophomore year in college, go to the NBA, get drafted by Detroit."" It's a dream of many young black men, but a recent study suggests only .03 percent of the youngsters playing ball as seniors in high school actually make it to the NBA. Another young man, who makes magic with the drums and also smiles broadly, is 14-year-old Jonathan Severe. Compton-Rock snaps pictures while dancing to the beat and tapping on a nearby African drum. She is shaking her head in both joy and disbelief, clearly thrilled by what she sees. It's been less than 48 hours since the group has arrived; they haven't even begun their service yet, and already the young man is opening up in a way she had never expected. Jonathan said maybe six words during his interview for entry to the program, and despite Compton-Rock's best mothering skills he never lifted his eyes from the floor. His grandmother came with him to the interview and kicked his leg under the table to get him to speak. It didn't work. He barely spoke and when he did, you could hardly hear him. It wasn't easy for Compton-Rock to decide to take him to Africa. Her selection committee feared he didn't have the communication skills needed to be an ambassador. Two days into the trip and Jonathan is effusive. I literally have to cut him off in interviews to get a word in. To see that, so early on, has been one of the thrills of this trip for me. Two days in and I can already tell this experience will be life-changing for all of us. What will they learn and discover about themselves, and the world? I'll let them tell you. All the kids have been asked to blog about the joys and the challenges, the things they're learning and the disappointments. We're taking photos and documenting every step they take in South Africa. The Bushwick kids came to make a difference in the lives of these vulnerable kids in South Africa. It will be equally interesting to see how South Africa's children make a difference in the lives of these children from Bushwick.",0.63122547,5729
50,"PADANG, Indonesia (CNN) -- The first school assembly since the earthquake was charged with emotion and grief. Students gather for the emotional assembly at their school in Padang, Indonesia. Students at SMA1 High School in Padang have been arriving amid the ruins of their classrooms hoping life will get back to normal quickly. They still don't know how many pupils were victims of the earthquake. Only half the 800 students turned up Monday. But there was a gasp of shock as the vice principal informed them that one member of staff had been killed in the quake. As prayers and a lament were sung in the yard, the emotion was too much for one teacher who fainted and was carried away. Many students have stories of narrow escapes and cheating death by seconds. Haria Fitri told me she was taking a shower when suddenly the bathroom started shaking violently. She grabbed a towel and ran downstairs and jumped out of a window, just as her house collapsed behind her. Many are clearly traumatized by what happened, mentioning how scared they are that another quake will again turn their world upside down. The teachers too seem stunned by what's happened. Most of the classrooms here are full of rubble and lessons are now being conducted in a tent outside, provided by United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF. 17-year-old student Harris Putrareza, said: ""When I see my school, very big destruction, I get a little sad, but I am very happy to be back to my school."" The school's English teacher, a warm, animated woman called Gustina said: ""They feel very sad, they can't control their emotions, what pity our school is broken."" In some ways the very spirit of the school has been damaged. It was built in 1917 during the Dutch colonial period and has survived numerous earthquakes down the years. But this one ripped the place apart, leaving mountains of red bricks lying on the desks and huge gaping holes in the ceiling. One building is simply too dangerous to enter and may have to be torn down. Everywhere there are little reminders of the day the earth shook so violently: the trophy cabinet full of toppled sports awards, the covered walkways choked with smashed stone pillars. The senior students are already wondering how they will cope when it comes to their important mid-term exams next week. The principal has announced a postponement, while they find a suitable room. Slowly the students at this highly-acclaimed school will refocus on their studies, but no one will forget that day at the end of September when everything changed in Padang.",0.6279019,7670
51,"CAVITE CITY, Philippines (CNN)  -- At 16, Rhandolf Fajardo reflects on his former life as a gang member. Efren Peñaflorida's Dynamic Teen Company offers Filipino youth an alternative to gangs through education. ""My gang mates were the most influential thing in my life,"" says Fajardo, who joined a gang when he was in sixth grade. ""We were pressured to join."" He's not alone. In the Philippines, teenage membership in urban gangs has surged to an estimated 130,000 in the past 10 years, according to the Preda Foundation, a local human rights charity. ""I thought I'd get stuck in that situation and that my life would never improve,"" recalls Fajardo. ""I would probably be in jail right now, most likely a drug addict -- if I hadn't met Efren."" Efren Peñaflorida, 28, also was bullied by gangs in high school. Today, he offers Filipino youth an alternative to gang membership through education. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""Gang members are groomed in the slums as early as 9 years old,"" says Peñaflorida. ""They are all victims of poverty."" For the past 12 years, Peñaflorida and his team of teen volunteers have taught basic reading and writing to children living on the streets. Their main tool: A pushcart classroom. Stocked with books, pens, tables and chairs, his Dynamic Teen Company recreates a school setting in unconventional locations such as the cemetery and municipal trash dump. Peñaflorida knows firsthand the adversity faced by these children. Born into a poor family, he lived in a shanty near the city dump site. But he says he refused to allow his circumstances to define his future. ""Instead of being discouraged, I promised myself that I would pursue education,"" he recalls. ""I will strive hard; I will do my best."" In high school, Peñaflorida faced a new set of challenges. Gang activity was rampant; they terrorized the student body, vandalized the school and inducted members by forcing them to rape young girls, he says. ""I felt the social discrimination. I was afraid to walk down the street."" Peñaflorida remembers standing up to a gang leader, refusing to join his gang. That confrontation proved fateful. At 16, he and his friends ""got the idea to divert teenagers like us to be productive,"" he says. He created the Dynamic Teen Company to offer his classmates an outlet to lift up themselves and their community. For Peñaflorida, that meant returning to the slums of his childhood to give kids the education he felt they deserved. ""They need education to be successful in life. It's just giving them what others gave to me,"" he says.

52,"(CNN) -- In the wake of the tragic shootings at Columbine High School, some schools across the country turned themselves into near-fortresses. Kindergarden students huddle beneath desks in a lockdown drill. Such drills have become common. They installed metal detectors and security cameras, banned backpacks, required students to carry IDs and posted police in the hallways -- all in the name of keeping students safe. Now, 10 years after those highly publicized shootings in which two young men killed 13 people and themselves, school security has taken another dramatic turn. Some of the noticeable security measures remain, but experts say the country is exploring a new way to protect kids from in-school violence: administrators now want to foster school communities that essentially can protect themselves with or without the high-tech gear. ""The first and best line of defense is always a well-trained, highly alert staff and student body,"" said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, an Ohio-based firm specializing in school security. ""The No. 1 way we find out about weapons in schools is not from a piece of equipment [such as a metal detector] but from a kid who comes forward and reports it to an adult that he or she trusts.""  See how many homicides have occurred in schools since 1992 » . The Obama administration plans to create secure schools indirectly, by improving overall education, getting kids more involved in their studies and strengthening school communities, said William Modzeleski, a high-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Education who handles school security. The trend is reflected in security funding, some of which comes from federal grants. Allocations for the Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools program were cut by a third between 1999 and 2008, to about $294.8 million last year. And a program that has put about 6,300 police officers in public schools since Columbine was scrapped by the U.S. Department of Justice after 2005, according to Corey Ray, a spokesman for the department. Ray said he's hopeful President Obama's stimulus package will put more police officers in schools. They act as law enforcement officers as well as counselors and mentors to students, he said. Meanwhile, money for a school counseling grant program has increased since Columbine, with $52 million set aside for this fiscal year, compared to $20 million in 2000, the first year the program was funded, according to budget numbers compiled for CNN by the Department of Education. So while there's more money available for counseling, there's still been a steady decline in federal spending for other aspects of school security. Some critics say a lack of available funding for high-tech security upgrades may be behind the shift toward less-costly and more indirect violence prevention measures. ""Right now, the economic situation is affecting [school security funding]. Particularly the technology components of security are going to suffer because there's just not going to be the money to do these kinds of things,"" said Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators. ""We're in the process of laying off teachers and staff."" Trump, the security consultant in Ohio, said schools have lost their focus on security since Columbine. But he added that many effective security programs cost little or no money -- only the time it takes to train teachers and students how to spot potential problems and how to react if a shooting were to occur. While metal detectors may not be the best tools to prevent school shootings, they still can be useful in some crime-ridden school districts and, along with security cameras, should not be abandoned entirely, Modzeleski said. Some evidence suggests strong school communities -- where kids feel like they can come forward with problems -- can prevent violent crime. A 2008 Secret Service report found that in more than 80 percent of instances of school violence, at least one person, usually a fellow student or peer, had knowledge of the attackers' plans. If people who suspect a problem feel comfortable enough in school to tell a teacher or a principal, then attacks could be prevented, Modzeleski said. After Columbine, many states and school districts made quick moves to increase school security, experts say. Modzeleski said this was a ""kneejerk"" reaction to the tragic, but rare, event; and a decade later, policies are settling into a middle ground. ""Immediately after any of these incidents I think there's the immediate rush for more security,"" he said. ""That's what I would call the kneejerk reaction to any type of these events: 'We need more cops; we need more metal detectors; we need more cameras.' After that settles in, I think people come to their senses and say, 'Hey, if we're going to keep our kids safe in schools, we need more than that.'"" iReport.com: How did Columbine affect you? After Columbine, some states started requiring schools to prepare for school shootings with lockdown drills, much in the way they prepare for fires or other disasters. About once a month in Fort Wayne, Indiana, public and private school students pull down window shades and huddle in the back corners of dark classrooms while their schools go into lockdown mode, said John Weicker, security director at Fort Wayne Community Schools. A school administrator roams the halls to make sure all doors are locked and all students are hidden from what might be a school shooter if this scenario was not a drill. ""You're training the kids,"" Weicker said. Similar drills -- which, in some states, are attended by armed and masked SWAT teams -- are now practiced routinely in nearly three-quarters of schools, according to a recent survey of 445 administrators funded by the American Association of School Administrators. It's difficult to say whether these policies are working, but by some measures, school safety has improved in the decade since Columbine.  Watch parents remember children lost at Columbine » . On average, there have been about half as many deaths per year since Columbine as in the seven school years before the tragedy, according to a 2007 report from the National Center for Education Statistics and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In the school year immediately following the Columbine shootings, the number of in-school homicides dropped from 33 in the 1998-1999 school year to 13 in the 1999-2000 year, the report says. Several experts say the tragedy brought awareness to the issue of school security, which on the whole has been positive. They worry, however, that attention has been waning in the past few years. A 17-year-old student in Fort Wayne, Indiana, however, said that while he is reassured by tight school security, it's a good thing that the Columbine shootings rarely enter his mind. ""There's a couple times that we'll talk about it in like a history class,"" said Travis Armstrong, a high school junior. ""Because that did happen back a while ago, and therefore it is considered history.""",0.6250464,2796

Pay attention in class, though; you never know what hidden talents your teachers might have. Just look at all of these famous former teachers: . After teaching and performing music, Gene Simmons is now starring in his own reality show, ""Family Jewels."" Gene Simmons: The tongue-flicking bassist of Kiss taught sixth grade in Harlem before he became the world's most famous bass-playing demon. Simmons later revealed in interviews that his superiors canned him for replacing the works of Shakespeare with Spiderman comics, which he thought the students were more likely to actually read. Alexander Graham Bell: The telephone pioneer got his start teaching Visible Speech at the Boston School for Deaf Mutes. He developed a bond with a student named Mabel Hubbard, and when she was 19 the two married. Sting: Before he became a star with The Police, Sting taught English, music, and soccer at St. Catherine's Convent School. Sting later said of working at a convent school, ""I was the only man on the faculty. In fact, I was the only teacher not in a habit."" Mental Floss: How 10 celebrities picked their stage names . Robert Frost: Like King, Frost worked as a teacher to supplement the income from his fledgling literary career. Frost worked as both a farmer and teacher at the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire. His students called him ""the Hen Man"" because the poet was afraid of chickens, and Frost allegedly had trouble remembering to milk the school's cows on time. Lyndon Johnson: The future president got his start as a principal at the Mexican-American Welhausen School in Cotulla, Texas. He later finished his teaching degree and landed gigs teaching public speaking at Pearsall High School in Pearsall Texas and Sam Houston High in Houston. The debate team he coached at Sam Houston lost the Texas state championship by a single point; Johnson supposedly had to vomit backstage before he could bring himself to congratulate the winners. Art Garfunkel: We can't speak for Paul Simon, but at least half of Simon and Garfunkel was really, really good at math. Garfunkel nearly earned a doctorate in the subject and was teaching math at the Litchfield Preparatory School in Connecticut when ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" soared to the top of the charts. John Adams: The second president of the United States spent a few years working as a schoolteacher in Worcester, Massachusetts. Teaching didn't suit Adams, who thought his students were nothing more than a ""large number of little runtlings, just capable of lisping A, B, C, and troubling the master."" He eventually gave up the job to go to law school. Mr. T: It was hard for Chicago students to be fools when it came to gym class in the mid-1970s. You'd pay attention if Mr. T told you to do jumping jacks, wouldn't you? Sylvester Stallone: Did you know you were watching a matchup of tough-guy teachers when Stallone and Mr. T battled in ""Rocky III?""  When Sly was attending the American College in Switzerland during the 1960s, he worked as a gym teacher to earn extra spending money.

Rowling: The Harry Potter author worked as an English teacher in Portugal as she plotted out the early adventures of her young wizards. Andy Griffith: Before he was a sheriff, before he was Matlock, Andy Griffith was a teacher. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, Griffith taught English at Goldsboro High School. Billy Crystal: The comedian worked as a junior high substitute teacher on Long Island while he waited for his career to take off. Among the classes he subbed for: girls' gym, which must have been a great source of material. Kris Kristofferson: The country star was a Rhodes Scholar who studied literature at Oxford before joining the Army and rising to the rank of captain. Towards the end of his tour of duty, Kristofferson took a job as an English teacher at West Point, but he decided against the professorship at the last minute. Instead of heading to New York, he resigned his commission and moved to Nashville in 1965. Stephen King: Although he initially had to work in an industrial laundry after his college graduation, the horror master eventually found a teaching job that paid a cool $6400 a year at the Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. King wrote ""Salem's Lot"" while living in a trailer and working this job during the day. Mental Floss: Mojave Desert's airplane graveyard . Sir William Golding: The author's experiences as a teacher helped inform the novel that made his career.

Here's some of what it includes: Tax breaks for companies that hire people who are currently unemployed. Tax breaks for businesses that spend money on major investments or purchases. And funding for highway and transit programs this year. Some experts say the bill could create 300,000 new jobs. Others say it doesn't guarantee that companies will start hiring, and some lawmakers have argued that the bill doesn't do nearly enough. Rising Waters . AZUZ: In parts of the midwestern United States, National Guard members and local volunteers are fighting to keep the Red River at bay. A lot of these volunteers are high school and college students who are spending their spring breaks filling and stacking sandbags. The river's waters are on the rise thanks to melting snow, and there's a threat of serious flooding. This same thing happened last year when the Red River hit a record level in Fargo, North Dakota. Rob Marciano has more on the impact of the severe weather then and now. (BEGIN VIDEO) ROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: In Fargo, North Dakota, residents are trying to stack one million sandbags in hopes of pushing back the Red River, which could crest 20 feet above flood stage later this week. Last year, about 100 homes in the area were damaged and thousands of people were evacuated when the Red didn't go down for a record 61 days and crested twice. In the Northeast, a wild storm has left hundreds of thousands of residents either without power or with most of what they own underwater. Trees ripped down power lines, tore up sidewalks and crushed cars. The storm is being blamed for at least seven deaths. Many had to leave their front doors by boat or in the arms of heavy equipment.

I'm not the capital of Michigan, but I am the largest city in the state. I'm Detroit, and I'm home to about 4 million people. Closing . AZUZ: In three months, more than 40 Detroit schools will be closed. It's part of a $1 billion plan that was announced yesterday. The Detroit School District is looking for ways to cut costs. Officials say this plan will save $31 million in 2010 and help save money in the future. At a meeting to announce the proposal, Robert Bobb, the Emergency Financial Manager for Detroit Public Schools, said it will create a ""leaner, smarter"" school system. Detroit is dealing with buildings and facilities that are getting older. Plus, student enrollment in the district has dropped significantly; there are 50,000 empty seats. Community members will get a chance to offer feedback at a series of town hall meetings. But yesterday, Mr. Bobb outlined the long-term goals for the district. ROBERT BOBB, EMERGENCY FINANCIAL MANAGER, DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOLS: We believe that this plan provides certainty where, in the minds of some, there may be uncertainty. We want to build flexible, adaptable and sustainable learning environments. We want to support smaller learning environments. Want to develop multi-use facilities that support community use and community partnerships. U.S. Relations . AZUZ: Last weekend, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. reportedly said the relationship between the two countries was the worst it's been in 35 years. We told you about that. Now, though, he says he never said that. There has been some tension between the countries recently, but the Israeli ambassador says ""recent events do not represent the lowest point in the relations between Israel and the United States."" He added that the nations disagree on some issues, but says he's confident the differences will soon be overcome. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had some harsh words for Israel recently. But on Tuesday, she called the bond between the countries ""unshakable,"" although she added that the U.S. is still waiting for Israel's response on proving that the Middle Eastern country is serious about a Middle East peace plan.

(BEGIN VIDEO) SOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Myron Rolle was on a fast track to having it all. MYRON ROLLE, NFL PROSPECT: How you doing? O'BRIEN: A gifted athlete, he was all but assured enormous fame and even bigger money. Then, something happened. You quit, basically. ROLLE: I did. I did. I don't like saying that word. O'BRIEN: From the moment he first touched a football, Myron Rolle was a star. ROLLE: I was pretty good at it. I was bigger than all the kids, so I had some success. O'BRIEN: In high school, ESPN ranked Myron the number one senior football player in the country. Eighty-three colleges made him an offer. Myron chose Florida State University, a prime launching pad for the pros. Myron played safety. His future: a shoo-in, first-round pick in the NFL draft last year, millions of dollars to follow. But that's when he basically quit, when he put it all at risk. Why did you leave? Why did you quit football? ROLLE: I left football because the Rhodes Scholarship was too great to pass up. It was either now or never. O'BRIEN: He won a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship, a chance to earn a Masters Degree in medical anthropology at Oxford University in England. Myron moved to England and watched the NFL draft from the sidelines. ROLLE: It hurt. It really did. It pained me. Like inside, deep. I said, I can be out there right now making millions of dollars. That could be my name being called. But when I went to Oxford, I said, this is the right choice. O'BRIEN: He's not done with his studies. He has more to do at Oxford. But now, nearly a year later, with that certainty of his, Myron Rolle came back. After a few years in the pros, he wants to go to med school to become a neurosurgeon. He's got to get back to England to finish his degree. ROLLE: This is the mud from England right here. O'BRIEN: Make no mistake, here, no one cares about Oxford. This is business, high stakes football. Is this guy as good as he was a year ago? And now, game on. Myron played well in the Senior Bowl. The NFL draft is weeks away. It's pressure. ROLLE: Sometimes it's overwhelming. Sometimes you have to take a step back. O'BRIEN: So many people counting on him. ROLLE: You know what RS stands for? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's that? ROLLE: Rhodes Scholar. O'BRIEN: For In America, Soledad O'Brien, CNN, Orlando. (END VIDEO) Downloadable Maps . AZUZ: Oxford, Israel, Detroit. Today's show's all over the map.

55,"(Mental Floss) -- Agatha Christie was a painfully shy girl, so her mom homeschooled her even though her two older siblings attended private school. President Woodrow Wilson didn't learn to read until age 12. Pearl S. Buck was born in West Virginia, but her family moved to China when she was just three months old. She was homeschooled by a Confucian scholar and learned English as a second language from her mom. Alexander Graham Bell was homeschooled by his mother until he was about 10. It was at this point that she started to go deaf and didn't feel she could properly educate him any more. Her deafness inspired Bell to study acoustics and sound later in life. If Thomas Edison were around today, he would probably be diagnosed with ADD -- he left public school after only three months because his mind wouldn't stop wandering. His mom homeschooled him after that, and he credited her with the success of his education: ""My mother was the making of me. She was so true, so sure of me; and I felt I had something to live for, someone I must not disappoint."" Mental Floss: Jefferson vs. Adams and the birth of negative campaigning . Ansel Adams was homeschooled at the age of 12 after his ""wild laughter and undisguised contempt for the inept ramblings of his teachers"" disrupted the classroom. His father took on his education from that point forward. Robert Frost hated school so much he would get physically ill at the thought of going. He was homeschooled until his high school years. Woodrow Wilson studied under his dad, one of the founders of the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS). He didn't learn to read until he was about 12. He took a few classes at a school in Augusta, Georgia, to supplement his father's teachings, and ended up spending a year at Davidson College before transferring to Princeton. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges . Mozart was educated by his dad as the Mozart family toured Europe from 1763-1766. Laura Ingalls Wilder was homeschooled until her parents finally settled in De Smet in what was then Dakota Territory. She started teaching school herself when she was only 15 years old. Louisa May Alcott studied mostly with her dad, but had a few lessons from family friends Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Can you imagine?

56,"(CNN)  -- More than 2,000 students in Southern California laid 65 miles of pennies on a speedway track Thursday in an attempt to set a world record and help schools in the area. Mason Gonzalez is ready with pennies. Dodgers tickets were prizes for collecting the most pennies. THINK (Teaching, Helping, Inspiring & Nurturing Kids) Together didn't meet its original goal of laying out 100 miles of pennies at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California, but group spokeswoman Nadia Flores said the group is happy with the results. ""We raised twice what we were able to lay down,"" she said. ""I think the energy and the vibe from having so many kids and volunteers present made it really fun."" Flores said the group ran out of time in its attempt to get all 100 miles laid out, but she added that they're confident they have the record anyway. Guinness World Records, which would certify the record, said Thursday it had not yet received documentation from the group. The current record for pennies laid out is 40 miles. The money -- about $84,500 -- will go to the nonprofit program that provides free after-school care for students at more than 200 elementary and middle schools in at-risk communities in four California counties -- Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino. Flores said the idea for ""Miles of Change"" came after group members saw students at a school in Kansas make a 40-mile chain of pennies in July 2008 to set the world record. Flores said her group, based in Santa Ana, California, wanted a program that would unite the counties involved -- and set a record. The pennies were collected by 35,000 students in the after-school program and were laid in loops around the two-mile track in Fontana, California. Flores said every penny must be touching the next penny in order to qualify for the Guinness world record. Documentation will include aerial photos, she said. Each student took home tubes to collect the pennies. Students who collected the most got tickets to future Los Angeles Dodgers games, Flores said. The effort also is meant to honor Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday and the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the Lincoln penny.",0.61096144,2092
57,"Editor's note: John Rice is founder and CEO of Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), a New York-based national nonprofit organization seeking to develop ""the next generation of African American, Hispanic and Native American leaders in major corporations, nonprofit organizations and entrepreneurial ventures."" John Rice says there's a tremendous need for new leaders in the nonprofit world. NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Obama has challenged all Americans to participate in the volunteer service movement and to support initiatives that help solve the problems that plague our communities. He recently introduced the Social Innovation Fund, intended to help increase the impact of the most effective and innovative nonprofits in our communities. This is a tremendous step in the right direction, but in order to expand these initiatives, we need a broader pool of leaders with a deep understanding of the communities they are serving and who have the skills, experience and relationships required to succeed in leadership roles. According to the Bridgespan Group, a leading nonprofit consulting firm, the number of vacant senior manager roles in the nonprofit arena is ever increasing, with 24,000 positions available in 2009 alone. Over the next 10 years, this sector will need to attract and develop more than two times the number of people currently employed in order to fill these roles. This next generation of leaders must come from within the communities that struggle most, as these leaders are the most passionate about making change and have the most to gain if successful.   Watch John Rice on preparing for leadership roles » . The good news is that there is an incredible desire among young African-Americans to give back to their communities. Darren Smith is a young investment banker who grew up in one of New York's underserved neighborhoods and won a scholarship to Baruch College in New York, where he graduated with honors. If you were to ask him what he wants to accomplish in his life, he will say that he aspires to do two things: become a business leader and build a nonprofit that has a large impact in the community in which he grew up. He believes that developing strong business skills, broad relationships and a track record of success will prepare him to maximize his impact in the community. Smith is one of thousands of talented African-American students and young professionals eager to become corporate or entrepreneurial leaders in sectors such as finance, technology, consulting and entertainment, where they have a broad sphere of influence that extends into their communities. Yet minority leaders remain dramatically under-represented in leadership positions and in the pipeline to those roles. Despite representing 13.5 percent of the U.S. population, African-Americans hold less than 3 percent of senior executive positions and represent only 5 percent of MBA graduates. To address this issue, I founded Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), a nonprofit that provides high-potential young people such as Smith with the ""key ingredients"" they need to realize their career potential -- the step by step career roadmap, coaching and mentoring, hard and soft skill development, door-opening relationships and a high-performing peer community. Every senior leader would say they would not be where they are today if they had not gotten some or all of these ingredients, but remarkably these key ingredients are not taught in even the best schools. Instead they are passed down through informal channels to which minorities still have more limited access. As a result, too many African-Americans who overcome a challenging home environment and troubled K-12 education system to attend college are not achieving their full career potential. Here at MLT, we have had exciting results to date: nearly 40 percent of the minority students at top business schools such as Harvard, Wharton and Kellogg completed MLT's MBA Prep program and 95 percent of the undergraduates who complete our Career Prep program land fast-track jobs at America's leading firms across all sectors. While participating in MLT's Career Prep program as a college student, Smith and several other MLT fellows founded a mentoring organization that prepares high school students from New York's most underserved communities for college. Like Smith, nearly 90 percent of our alumni desire to launch or lead a nonprofit organization at some point in their careers, and many are already well down the path. To harness this potential, MLT has built a robust curriculum that prepares our fellows to enter and succeed in the social entrepreneurship sector, and we partner with leading nonprofits and foundations such as Teach for America, Stand for Children, New Profit, The Knight Foundation and Blue Ridge Foundation to connect MLT alumni to other talent pipelines. Despite these advances, there is still much more to be done. It is not enough to get African-Americans into fast-track entry-level positions or MBA programs; we need a comprehensive, multistage approach to enable them to overcome hurdles they will encounter along the path to the senior leadership levels. Research shows that the largest challenge for minorities is the transition from middle management to senior management, so more investment is needed at that stage. By helping to grow organizations such as MLT and other successful talent development initiatives, I believe that we will succeed in filling the growing leadership gap in corporations, nonprofits, entrepreneurial ventures and the government. Once there, African-Americans and other under-represented minorities will have the passion, financial capital, experience and relationships they need to be change agents in the communities that are in desperate need of our support. The success of our nation depends on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Rice.",0.6098607,8728
58,"(CNN) -- Universities nationwide were recovering Friday, a day after protests over education budget cuts hit campuses from coast to coast. Though many of the demonstrations were peaceful, some turned chaotic. On the West Coast, the University of California, Santa Cruz, was scheduled to reopen Friday. The crush of demonstrators on Thursday caused administrators to close the northern California campus. ""Please check back for information on the campus's planned return to service on Friday,"" the university Web site said. The protest, dubbed the March 4 National Day of Action, sent thousands of students, educators and supporters to the streets to challenge budget cuts and tuition increases. In Oakland, California, police arrested 160 protesters who shut down a freeway, authorities said. Police stopped students from shutting down a freeway near the University of California, Davis, in northern California. Demonstrations occurred in other states including Colorado, New York and Wisconsin. A blog called Student Activism, which compiled a list of the protests, said 122 events were slated in 33 states,  most on campuses and some at state capitols. Many of Thursday's demonstrations focused on cuts in state funding for colleges and universities, which supporters say drive up tuition, limit classes and make higher education unobtainable to many. State funding for the California State University system was reduced by nearly $1 billion for the academic years between 2008 and 2010. Schools have responded by increasing fees, canceling classes, cutting student support programs and furloughing professors. Fees have increased 182 percent since 2002. Class waiting lists have doubled or tripled. ""The less affordable education becomes, the less likely low-income students will be able to get a college education,"" said Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association and a professor of history at California State University, Los Angeles.",0.60928303,9791
59,"(CNN) --  I spoke at TED in 2006, the year they started to put the talks online. I'm told that since then, the talk has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times in more than 200 countries. The number of people who've seen it may be 20 times that or more. I have a stream of e-mails, tweets and blog posts round the world from young people, parents, students, teachers, cultural activists and business leaders of all sorts. They tell me how deeply they relate to the talk and often that they've seen or shown it many times at meetings, conferences, workshops and retreats. Parents tell me they've shown it to their children; young people tell me they've shown it to their parents. They say they've laughed and sometimes cried together and had a different sort of conversation as a result. Changing the conversation is one of the primary purposes of TED. Why has this talk had such an impact? I think there are several reasons. To begin with, the talk is short. The 18-minute talk is part of the genius of TED. In a world of instant messaging, rampant data and overspecialization, brevity is a virtue. (Even so, I've seen blogs that strongly recommend the talk but warn that it's almost 20 minutes long.) A second factor is that, based on the audience's reaction, the talk is entertaining and funny at times, which always helps. And I'd just had my hair cut. We may never know how much that simple act contributed to the global appeal of the talk. But the real reason for its impact is that what I'm saying clearly resonates deeply with people of all ages and across many different cultures. I believe that the argument is becoming more urgent by the day. What is the argument? In a nutshell, it's that we're all born with immense natural talents but our institutions, especially education, tend to stifle many of them and as a result we are fomenting a human and an economic disaster. In education, this vast waste of talent involves a combination of factors. They include a narrow emphasis on certain sorts of academic work; the exile of arts, humanities and physical education programs from schools; arid approaches to teaching math and sciences; an obsessive culture of standardized testing and tight financial pressures to teach to the tests. The result is a disastrous waste of talent among students and their teachers. To sense the scale of this disaster, you only have to look at the alarming rates of turnover among faculty and the levels of drop out, disaffection, stress and prescription drug use among students. Even for students who stay the course and do well in education, the rules of success have changed irrevocably. Just look at the plummeting value of college degrees. The waste of talent in education is not deliberate. Teachers are as anxious about this as everyone else, but many of them feel trapped in the awkward groping of national reform policies, many of which misunderstand the problems as well as the solutions. The waste of talent isn't deliberate, but it is systematic. It happens in part because the dominant systems of education are rooted in the values and demands of industrialism: they are linear, mechanistic and focused on conformity and standardization. Nowadays, they're buttressed by major commercial interests in mass testing and by the indiscriminate use of prescription drugs that keep students' minds from wandering to things they naturally find more interesting. The tragedy is that meeting the many social, economic, spiritual and environmental challenges we now face depends absolutely on the very capacities of insight, creativity and innovation that these systems are systematically suppressing in yet another generation of young people. Reforming these systems is not enough. The truth is that we are caught up in a cultural and economic revolution. This revolution is global in scale and unpredictable in nature. To meet it, we need a revolution in the culture of education. This new culture has to emerge from a richer sense of human ability. To shape it, I believe we have to leave behind the manufacturing principles of industrialism and embrace the organic principles of ecology. Education is about developing human beings, and human development is not mechanical or linear. It is organic and dynamic. Like all living forms, we flourish in certain conditions and shrivel in others. Great teachers, great parents and great leaders understand those conditions intuitively; poor ones don't. The answer is not to standardize education, but to personalize and customize it to the needs of each child and community. There is no alternative. There never was. The good news is that all around the world there are wonderful examples of people and organizations that are making determined efforts to do things differently in education -- and in business, health care, architecture, communities and cultural programs. There are examples of these all over the TED Web site and in the expanding ripples of the TED prizes. TED itself is a great example of the spirit of collaboration and inter-disciplinarily that is the essential to a genuine culture of creativity. What are the principles of this culture? Towards the end of my talk, I mention a book I was working on called ""Epiphany."" It was published this year under a much better title, ""The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything"" (Viking) and is now in 11 languages. It draws on conversations with people in science, business, education, the arts, sports and more on how they found in themselves the talents and passions that have shaped their lives. But the book is not about them: it's about you and your children, if you have any; and your friends too, if you have any of those. There's a wealth of talent that lies in all of us.

61,"NIAGARA FALLS, New York (CNN)  -- Thirty years ago this summer, America learned the name Love Canal. The working-class Niagara Falls neighborhood built atop tons of chemical waste became a synonym for environmental disaster. Lois Gibbs, who runs an environmental justice group, shows a photo of children from Love Canal protesting. Troubles at the local elementary school -- and health problems among its students, such as seizure disorders -- were among the first signs of a much larger problem that made news around the world and prompted federal Superfund legislation to clean up the most polluted sites in the United States. Despite the outcry over Love Canal, little has been done to make schoolchildren safer from hazardous or toxic waste, says Lois Gibbs, who headed the Love Canal Homeowners Association and now runs the Center for Health, Environment & Justice. ""We should be farther along today than we are,"" said Gibbs, who started the nonprofit a year after her evacuation from Love Canal. The organization is dedicated to helping communities facing environmental threats. A 2005 study by the Center for Health, Environment & Justice looking at just four states -- Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Michigan -- found half a million children attending schools within half a mile of known toxic dumps. Gibbs points to New Bedford High School in Massachusetts as an example of children at risk. New Bedford High opened in 1972 on top of a former burn dump for PCBs, an industrial chemical linked to cancer and brain damage. PCB levels in the body build over time, raising health risks. ""Like a lot of teachers there now, I figured, how bad could it be? I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005,"" said former New Bedford teacher Susan Dias, who is now cancer-free. She is returning to the classroom this fall but will not go back to New Bedford High. Former teacher Maria Quann also says New Bedford High made her ill. ""I became very, very sick. My immune system shut down. I collapsed and was bedridden for several months,"" Quann said. Her health improved after she left the high school, she says, and she has now retired. Maureen Woolley, who worked in the cafeteria, says she compiled a list of 25 school employees who died of cancer. Three classrooms were closed last year because of high PCB levels, but the school has been scrubbed and a new ventilation system added. The rooms are expected to be open this fall. There have been no reports of students at the high school becoming sick as a result of the toxic waste. ""I wouldn't have kids in the school if I didn't think it was safe. I would close the school,"" said Mayor Scott Lang, whose two sons attended New Bedford High. PCB levels inside the school now fall within federal guidelines, he says. Despite results of ongoing air-quality testing, teacher David Greene remains skeptical. ""I do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous,"" he said. Only seven states have laws preventing cities and towns from building schools on or near toxic waste, according to the Center for Health Environment and Justice. They are Massachusetts, Rhode Island, California, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi and Utah. ""You can go most anyplace and build [a school] on top of a Superfund site,"" Gibbs said. ""They can build a school anywhere they want, really. And that's the sad truth. I think at schools, very little has changed, and that's unfortunate."" Even in states with laws, many are weak or poorly enforced, she says. In Massachusetts, state law prevents schools only from being built close to active waste dumps, which would not have prevented New Bedford High's construction three decades ago on a former dump site. In Niagara Falls, Gibbs' home was built three blocks from 20,000 tons of industrial waste placed in barrels and buried in a mile-long ditch by a plastics and chemical maker. The 99th Street Elementary was built on top of the dump. Gibbs, married with two young children at the time, recalls elementary school students playing with ooze bubbling up on the playground. ""The children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them,"" Gibbs said. ""So, for example, one of these things was phosphorous rocks. Phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface. The children would pick up these phosphorous rocks, and when you threw them at a hard surface, they would explode like a firecracker."" Some children were badly burned by the phosphorous, she adds. Gibbs says neighborhood children also played with the chemical Lindane, a pollutant associated with skin irritation, nausea, convulsions -- even death. ""I have a high school education. I don't have a science degree, but you don't have to be a scientist to know that 20,000 tons of chemicals and kindergartners don't mix,"" Gibbs said.",0.608771,5907
62,"(CNN) -- Jennifer Muzquiz was ""goth"" in high school. She had, and still has, multicolored hair, a ""face full of piercings,"" and an all-black wardrobe, even though she no longer identifies with the goth subculture. And while her style had always earned her her fair share of strange glances, she says everything changed for the worse after the Columbine school shootings on April 20, 1999. Jennifer Muzquiz, in all black, decided to study at home after feeling shunned as a goth after Columbine. It was on that day that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and teachers in a shooting spree at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The massacre was one of the deadliest school shootings in history, and it had a profound effect on students and teachers across the country. As the media and the public groped for meaning behind the incident, there were plenty of theories about the motive behind the massacre. One of these was that Harris and Klebold were members of the goth subculture, or ""trench-coat mafia"" as they were known at Columbine, and thus had been outcasts. This theory has been widely refuted, but for goth students around the country, the damage was done. ""As a result [of Columbine], the public were afraid of the 'goths' and 'punks' and 'metalheads' at school,"" says Muzquiz, who was a high school senior at the time. ""Parents, often successfully, lobbied to get trench coats and all-black attire banned in their local schools. School administrators started considering these groups to be gangs and harassment of students was rampant, with unwarranted backpack searches, detainment in the hallways by security guards, and being called into the administrative offices for questioning."" Rumors ran rampant about kids who ""looked like they were going to bring a gun to school,"" and Muzquiz says her classmates quickly learned if they wanted to cause trouble for a student, all they had to do was report that student had a list of enemies. ""They could simply report to administrators that the person had an 'enemies list' and the school would quickly swoop in to rectify the situation, even when it wasn't the truth. ... The accused would forever be known as 'the kid with the list' and ostracized,"" she says. Because of this and the new dress code restrictions, her goth friends ""were afraid to go to school."" Muzquiz herself caught so much flak for her appearance that she went into home studies. And though she was no longer in school, discrimination couldn't be avoided. People in town would cross to the other side of the street to avoid her and her friends, she says. iReport.com: 'Sadly, teens still tend to shun those who are different than they are' Muzquiz was even interviewed by the national media about her experiences after Columbine. At first she regretted it and feared backlash. ""I had already gotten enough crap since Columbine about wearing all black,"" she says. But she was glad she did it after receiving e-mails from other students who identified with her and thanked her for the interviews, including one girl who was suicidal until reading an article about her. ""One girl even had e-mailed me and said [she] was coming home to write a suicide note ... and kill herself after school. She read the article about me and it made her think twice,"" says Muzquiz. ""In the article, I said it's not worth letting these people get to you. It's not up to them to tell you that you're wrong. She thanked me."" ""[To have] a 14-year-old e-mail me ... it was just, like, whoa, I don't care who says anything bad ... I helped someone,"" says Muzquiz. ""To this day that just sticks with me. Anything I do in my life -- nothing's going to measure to that, the fact that I helped someone realize that there's more to life."" Things changed for teachers after Columbine, too. Many say they realized they weren't just responsible for their students' knowledge, but for their overall well-being. ""Life was never the same after that day,"" says Barbara Rademacher, a veteran teacher from Rogers, Arkansas. Schools across the country instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks and metal detectors, and teachers were trained to deal with violent behavior. But more than that, says Rademacher, ""teachers and students are always just a little afraid."" ""What Columbine said to me as an educator was that we in the education community hold people's lives in our hands. ... We as educators have a much higher duty, a much higher call, than just to teach our subject areas. ... Columbine was to education what 9/11 was to the United States: a shattering wake-up call, a disaster so profound, it permanently changed our world view.""  iReport.com: 'Education is literally a matter of life and death' Kym Godwin remembers a similar wake-up call after the shooting. She was a first-year teacher in Ilwaco, Washington, at the time. ""I think most people who go into teaching have the desire to go out there and change the world and enlighten kids and bring them to this great level of knowledge,"" she says. ""I remember when it happened, all of a sudden, it was like: 'How can I give them all of this knowledge if I can't keep them safe?' I realized at that moment that my job wasn't just giving them academic learning, it was also about protecting them and making them feel like they're in a safe place."" This realization hit home for her when her school had a lockdown. Teenagers from another part of town had entered the school, allegedly looking for a student there. A school security guard apprehended them right outside the door to Godwin's classroom. ""I remember thinking, what would happen if somebody actually walked in the door? ... And that's when it hit me, that the kids have to be able to trust me as their teacher to protect them regardless of who walks through that door. I told the kids, this is real, and I am the one in control and I will protect you. ... And I found out afterward that virtually every teacher in the building did the exact same thing. The kids looked to us and knew we were there to keep them safe."" Godwin also means ""safe"" in a different way. It includes protecting her students from physical harm, yes, but also protecting them from bullying or social stigmas that could potentially lead to violent behavior. Some investigators have said there is evidence to suggest the Columbine shooters were victims of bullying or ostracism, and Godwin says this is a nationwide problem. ""What happened at Columbine could happen virtually anywhere. Kids get picked on, and it could get to a point where they snap. They're human beings,"" she says.  iReport.com: 'My students are my kids'",0.6056488,2837
63,"(CNN) -- CNN.com asked its users what they would do if they had all the money they needed. What would they do in retirement? Or would they retire? Several CNN.com users said they would buy a motorhome and travel around the United States to NASCAR events. We received more than 1,400 replies. Some people wanted to volunteer in other countries, some wanted to find new hobbies, some just wanted to relax for a change. Here are some of the edited responses that users around the world sent in. Reza Rohani of Tehran, Iran I would develop an NGO for popularization of science in Iran and some Central Asian countries. I would establish a publication house solely for the mentioned purpose and travel around the world to become more acquainted with different cultures and produce information packages and audio-visual documentaries to bring about a better understanding to people in different countries. E. Noonan of Natick, Massachusetts Oh, if I didn't have to work, I would spend my time on my dream of acting. Slogging around New York trying to get auditions, get into stage plays, get an agent -- all that sounds wonderful, as long as there is enough money to live on. Voice-over work and straight plays ... I would be in heaven. Frank Morganti  of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida I'd continue my work as a general contractor as my new hobby and wouldn't worry about money. Eric Scheffer of Bangkok, Thailand Retirees and financially independant people can still be of great use to society and communities. There is, for example, still a lot of poverty in Asia and Africa. Living costs are low, and retirees can live comfortably in Asia or Africa while participating in community work. One can, for example, teach simple things in the villages: hygiene, healthy cooking, etc. They can also give aid and simple loving care to small children. I would like to encourage retirees and financially independant people to become actively involved in such countries, and make a difference. There is no need for us or any healthy retiree to sit around and wait for death. The world needs us. Mandy Sickler of Marion, Indiana I'd finish my last year in college as a social work major and I would pay off all my college loans. Then I wish I had the means to load up a huge plane full of food, water and clothing/shoes to take to underprivileged countries and teach the people how to use the food I brought them. I would bring over educators to teach the people in these places about how to maintain their health. If I could, I would provide every child with the correct physical checkups and immunization shots. But this would be way out of reach for me to do; so if I didn't have to work, I would join the Peace Corps and work my butt off to help in any way I could. Roger Belanger of Tiverton, Rhode Island I'd be involved somehow in the theatre arts. My mid-life crisis hit about 10 years ago at 40 and I became involved in amateur theatre. If I were able to ""walk away from it all,"" I would dedicate my life to the performing arts in some fashion. Robert Madden of Parsons, Kansas . Buy a motor home and become a NASCAR fan on the road at a different track every weekend. Cicely Jette of Boston, Massachusetts I would develop the other side of my brain! I'm a research scientist and spend most of my time on data analysis, organization and logic. If I didn't have to work, I would learn to sing opera, how to speak French and Italian fluently, how to act, and I would spend all my free time in museums. That is ... until I overloaded my right brain and was driven back to the lab. Mark Albert  of Salmon River, Nova Scotia I would do the same as now: stay home with my kids. I have already decided to leave my job to be able to spend time with my kids in the most valuable time of their lives and mine. My wife works and makes enough for me to be able to do so and I am very grateful! Not enough parents stay home to raise their own kids. It rocks! Valerie Cathell of Dumfries, Virginia If I didn't have to work is tough to contemplate; however, I have fantasized about helping kids who are not able to read or are trapped in war-torn areas with no exposure to education. I am an educator currently, and I work in a small private school where funds are scarce. I understand limitations when there is not enough money. I would love to be able to touch the lives of kids who have no idea what an X-Box is or an iPod. Even in our environment, we have parents paying private tuition, who have the means to provide these ""often taken for granted"" things. But that is what they are: things. I worked with my fifth grade class to create a book for children in Uganda last year. After receiving the book, the liaison/facilitator of the program, sent our school a DVD of the children in Uganda. We shared this with our students and they were in awe of the way those kids actually lived. It was a life-changing experience and one that inspired me to seek ways to help others more often. Donald LaMarr Sr. of Antioch, California If I didn't have to work I would spend a significant portion of my time on the streets of Oakland, Berkley, and San Francisco, California, approaching and mentoring potential gang members in a different more positive direction. We have more than 1 million young African-American males who are either unemployed or underemployed who need some direction and someone to show them that there is a different way, a better culture than the gang culture. I  would help guide them back to our educational institutions. I would help to create hybrid educational institutions for the most incorrigible amongst them. These would not be the gladiator training camps that our youth prisons have become. These would be places where education and cultural development become mandatory and punishment for failing or resisting assimilation would be severe. That's what I would spend most of my time doing if I were retired. Jeffrey Young of McKinney, Texas For every person that needed help, I would stop and offer assistance. From one to the next, like a connect-the-dots on the map of the world just to see how I could band-aid my way across the globe in search of myself while making a difference from the smallest to the greatest challenges thrown at me. I would be a constant part of the solution. If I had nothing to worry about financially well, 90 percent of my problems would go away and then I would have the rest of my life to focus on the things that matter. I would go about developing relationships, experiencing the lives of others all while uplifting spirits of the world one soul at a time. I would breathe life from the Himalayas. Ride the currents in the waters of Costa Rica. Listen to jazz in New Orleans. Dip in the hot springs by Vancouver, British Columbia. Really. There is not enough time for me to talk about everything I would do. Instead, trust in that I would never waste a moment learning life all over again. Debra Ross of Rex, Georgia If I were the recipient of a sudden, legal windfall, I'd immediately quit my job and purchase an RV and travel to every state in America driving at a consistent, aggravating 40 mph. Isn't that what the people do when they travel in those things anyway? Far be it from me to break the rules.  E-mail to a friend .",0.6054167,1493
64,"(CNN) -- The case of a 13-year-old Arizona girl strip-searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain-reliever will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court this week. The Supreme Court has a mixed record when it comes to students' rights. The justices in January accepted the Safford school district case for review, and will decide whether a campus setting gives school administrators greater discretion to control students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed in cases involving adults in general public spaces. The case is centered around Savana Redding, now 19, who in 2003 was an eighth-grade honors student at Safford Middle School, about 127 miles from Tucson, Arizona. Redding was strip-searched by school officials after a fellow student accused her of providing prescription-strength ibuprofen pills. The school has a zero-tolerance policy for all prescription and over-the-counter medication, including the ibuprofen, without prior written permission. ""In this case, the United States Supreme Court will decide how easy it is for school officials to strip search your child,"" Adam Wolf, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing Redding, told CNN Radio on Sunday. Wolf told CNN Radio his client was traumatized by the search. ""School officials undoubtedly have difficult jobs, but sometimes they overreact -- and this was just a clear overreaction,"" he said. Redding was pulled from class by a male vice principal, escorted to an office, where she denied the accusations. A search of Redding's backpack found nothing. Then, although she never had prior disciplinary problems, a strip search was conducted with the help of a school nurse and Wilson's assistant, both females. According to court records, she was ordered to strip to her underwear and her bra was pulled out. Again, no drugs were found. In an affidavit, Redding said, ""The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had. I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry."" At issue is whether school administrators are constitutionally barred from conducting searches of students investigated for possessing or dealing drugs that are banned on campus. A federal appeals court found the search ""traumatizing"" and illegal. Some parents say older children deserve the same constitutional rights as adults, but educators counter a school setting has always been treated differently by courts, and a ruling against them could jeopardize campus safety. While a federal magistrate and a three-panel appeals court found the search was reasonable, the full 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Redding last year. ""Common sense informs us,"" wrote the court, ""that directing a 13-year-old girl to remove her clothes, partially revealing her breasts and pelvic area, for allegedly possessing ibuprofen ... was excessively intrusive."" The court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom. ""The overzealousness of school administrators in efforts to protect students has the tragic impact of traumatizing those they claim to serve. And all this to find prescription-strength ibuprofen."" In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the school district said restrictions on conducting student searches would cast a ""roadblock to the kind of swift and effective response that is too often needed to protect the very safety of students, particularly from the threats posed by drugs and weapons."" School officials said the court was ""wholly uninformed about a disturbing new trend"" -- the abuse of over-the-counter medication by teenagers. The high court has a mixed record over the years on students' rights. In a famous 1969 ruling, the justices said students do not ""shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate."" But decisions in the 1980s gave administrators greater discretion, including one case that said officials need not be required to have a warrant to search a student's locker. Such a search was permitted if there were ""reasonable"" grounds for believing it would turn up evidence and when the search was not ""excessively intrusive."" Opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes, and those participating in other extracurricular activities. And in a well-publicized 2007 ruling from Alaska, the Supreme Court upheld the suspension of a student who displayed a large ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus"" banner at an off-campus, but school-sponsored, event. The decision did not endorse a broader argument that students in general have limited free-speech rights when they interfere with a school's vaguely defined ""educational mission."" The court could now be asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches, and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over. The case is Safford United School District No. 1 v. Redding (08-479).",0.60249424,9232
65,"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- The high school honor student and the NFL's highest-paid defensive back stroll down the destitute streets of Skid Row. ""I can sell you something right quick,"" a drug dealer hisses. Another shouts, ""Gonna whoop your ass!"" More expletives are hurled. Seventeen-year-old Kenneth Chancey is giving a tour to Nnamdi Asomugha, showing the NFL star the streets that he and his sister used to walk to get to school while living in a Skid Row homeless shelter. Prostitutes, addicts and drug dealers scatter. ""Camera! Camera!"" they shout. The two make it safely past the park, one of the roughest areas of Los Angeles. An orange soda whizzes through the air, nearly hitting the teen and the Oakland Raiders' All-Pro cornerback worth $45 million. ""Wow,"" the teen says. ""I'm sure they watch you every Sunday, and they don't even recognize who you are."" It is Kenneth's inner strength and his love for education that have brought together this high school class president and NFL star. ""The thing I took away is how fearless he is,"" Asomugha said later. ""The things he's been through are so big and so severe -- they were threatening our lives and throwing things at us on Skid Row. But it doesn't bother him. ""His potential meter is at 1,000 right now."" Escaping through education . Even while Kenneth lived on Skid Row, he dreamed of attending Harvard to become a neurosurgeon. When Asomugha saw Kenneth's story on CNN, he wanted to help. He runs a foundation, the Asomugha College Tour for Scholars, that takes talented inner-city kids on tours of college campuses they otherwise would never be able to see. He's helped get 25 teens into college over the last four years. On this day, he's come to tell Kenneth that he will be among the 16 students traveling in the spring to visit schools in Washington, D.C. ""I'm thankful to be able to give back,"" Asomugha said. Hours before the Skid Row tour, Asomugha traveled to Hollywood's Helen Bernstein High School, where Kenneth is a starting running back in his senior year. They met at the school's football stadium, where Asomugha told Kenneth in person. ""This smile on my face,"" Kenneth said, ""is a freaking good thing. This is awesome!"" Asomugha leaned closer. ""You know who we're working on now?"" ""Obama?"" Kenneth asked nervously. ""We have to,"" the NFL star replied. Kenneth's fever-pitched excitement reached a crescendo, ""Oh my gosh!"" His father, Gordon Costello, joined in and handed a folded paper to Asomugha. The proud dad didn't show off football awards or his son's athletic achievements. Instead, it's Kenneth's latest report card, straight A's. ""He might overqualify for the tour,"" Asomugha said as he studied the report card. ""This shows someone with a lot of drive and ambition. These are some great grades."" ""I'm at a loss for words,"" the teen said. ""Stuff like this doesn't happen every day."" Asomugha came from a family where education was stressed from day one. He remembers asking his mom as a boy, ""Can I have some ice cream?"" ""No,"" she responded. ""You haven't finished your homework."" ""I'd say, 'but I'm 3!' "" Asomugha's sister is a pediatrician, his mother holds a doctorate. Two other siblings have secondary degrees. ""I am the least educated in my family,"" Asomugha said. ""I catch a lot of heat from my family."" The football star, who is the highest-paid defensive back in NFL history, has a degree in finance from the University of California-Berkeley. Kenneth is energized. ""I'm going to be the first one in my family to get a secondary education,"" he told Asomugha. ""And everyone will follow you,"" his father added. Kenneth spent his sixth-grade year living in a van with his mother and stepfather. His sister once was beaten up by someone who wanted her shirt. Kenneth was held up at gunpoint for his laptop. He refused to hand it over because his grandmother bought it for him. ""If you're going to shoot me, shoot me now,"" he told the would-be thief. ""He said, 'I ain't gonna kill no little kid.' "" Mantra: Always keep your head up . From February to August of this year, Kenneth lived at the Union Rescue Mission homeless shelter along Skid Row with his father and sister. After the CNN piece aired, his friend invited him and his sister, Stephanie, to stay with his family, while Kenneth's father looked for work. Outside Kenneth's earshot, the NFL star talked about how the teen is an inspiration, doing all the right things to achieve greatness in life. ""You don't hear about guys like Kenneth,"" Asomugha said. ""When you have your back against the wall and you're trying to fight and there are so many things -- so many obstacles -- against you but you're still keeping your head above the water like he's doing ... the sky's the limit."" Kenneth says he constantly thought about dropping out to get a job to help his father financially. His dad would have none of it. ""Your education will pay off in the long run,"" his father always told him. On the tour at Skid Row, Kenneth took Asomugha to the shelter's rooftop. It's a million-dollar view of the Los Angeles skyline. It's where Kenneth studied. It's also where he learned his biggest lesson: to always keep his head up. The student and the football player leaned over the building's ledge. Down below, drug deals were being made. ""Anytime you look down over the ledge, you start to see the negative,"" Asomugha said. ""When you keep your head up, you're seeing all the positive. Was that your mantra?"" The teen smiled. ""That's how you do it in life,"" Kenneth said. ""I just try to keep my head up, to look into the future."" Five years from now, he'll be graduating from college. The hell of Skid Row will be a distant memory. ""Once I succeed,"" he said, ""I will be able to help other people."" CNN's Traci Tamura and Gregg Canes contributed to this report.",0.6024282,7004
66,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former middle-school student who was strip-searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain medication won a partial victory of her Supreme Court appeal Thursday in a case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety. Savana Redding leaves the U.S Supreme Court in April. She was 13 when she was strip-searched. Savana Redding was 13 when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs. No medication was found, and she later sued. The justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued. The larger issue of whether a campus setting traditionally gives schools greater authority over students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed was not addressed fully by the divided court. ""Savana's subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening and humiliating,"" wrote Justice David Souter for the majority, likely his last opinion before he steps down from the bench next week. But reflecting the divisiveness over the issue, Souter said, ""We think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case."" Whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court. ""I'm pretty excited that they agreed with me, they see that it was wrong for the school to do that,"" Redding said from her Hobbs, New Mexico, home after the ruling was announced. ""I'm pretty certain that it's so far less likely to happen again"" to other students. Redding was an eighth-grade honor student in 2003, with no history of disciplinary problems at Safford Middle School, about 127 miles from Tucson, Arizona. During an investigation into pills found at the school, a student told the vice principal that Redding had given her prescription-strength 400-milligram ibuprofen pills. The school had a near-zero-tolerance policy for all prescription and over-the-counter medication, including the ibuprofen, without prior written permission. Redding was pulled from class by Vice Principal Kerry Wilson, escorted to an office and confronted with the evidence. The girl denied the accusations. A search of Redding's backpack found nothing. A strip search was conducted by Wilson's assistant and a school nurse, both females. Redding was ordered to strip to her underwear and to pull on the elastic of the underwear, so any hidden pills might fall out, according to court records. No drugs were found. ""The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had,"" Redding said in an affidavit. ""I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry."" Souter said Wilson initially had ""sufficient suspicion"" to justify searching the girl's backpack and outer clothing. But when no contraband was found, the officials went too far by continuing the search of her underwear. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Redding and her family sued, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the school, calling the search ""traumatizing"" and illegal. That court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom. The Supreme Court found little agreement on key issues. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that the search was illegal but would have also made individual officials liable for damages by Redding. ""Wilson's treatment of Redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it,"" said Ginsburg, who was especially forceful during oral arguments in April, criticizing the school's actions. But Justice Clarence Thomas took the opposite view: that administrators deserved immunity and that the search was permissible. ""Preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution,"" he said. ""And, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative."" In 1985, the high court allowed the search of a student's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes. Such a search was permitted if there were ""reasonable"" grounds for believing that it would turn up evidence and when the search was not ""excessively intrusive."" Opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes and those participating in other extracurricular activities. The court was being asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over. Adam Wolf, an ACLU attorney who represented Redding, applauded the decision. ""When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials,"" Wolf said . But school administrators said the ruling does not make their jobs any easier. ""The home medicine cabinet now poses a serious threat to students, who may take those medications for abusive purposes,"" said Francisco Negron, general counsel for the National School Boards Association. ""That's a problem schools are trying to stem."" ""How they determine now whether the drug is dangerous, whether it's not dangerous -- that kind of clarity and that kind of guidance, the court did not give us."" Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience. ""Before it happened, I loved school, loved everything about it. You know, I had a 4.0 GPA, honor roll, and now, well, afterwards I never wanted to go to school again."" She is attending college. The case is Safford Unified School District No. 1 v.

A strip search was conducted by Wilson's assistant and a school nurse, both females. Redding was ordered to strip to her underwear and to pull on the elastic of the underwear, so any hidden pills might fall out, according to court records. No drugs were found. ""The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had,"" Redding said in an affidavit. ""I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry."" Souter said Wilson initially had ""sufficient suspicion"" to justify searching the girl's backpack and outer clothing. But when no contraband was found, the officials went too far by continuing the search of her underwear. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Redding and her family sued, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the school, calling the search ""traumatizing"" and illegal. That court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom. The Supreme Court found little agreement on key issues. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that the search was illegal but would have also made individual officials liable for damages by Redding. ""Wilson's treatment of Redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it,"" said Ginsburg, who was especially forceful during oral arguments in April, criticizing the school's actions. But Justice Clarence Thomas took the opposite view: that administrators deserved immunity and that the search was permissible. ""Preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution,"" he said. ""And, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative."" In 1985, the high court allowed the search of a student's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes. Such a search was permitted if there were ""reasonable"" grounds for believing that it would turn up evidence and when the search was not ""excessively intrusive."" Opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes and those participating in other extracurricular activities. The court was being asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over. Adam Wolf, an ACLU attorney who represented Redding, applauded the decision. ""When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials,"" Wolf said . But school administrators said the ruling does not make their jobs any easier. ""The home medicine cabinet now poses a serious threat to students, who may take those medications for abusive purposes,"" said Francisco Negron, general counsel for the National School Boards Association. ""That's a problem schools are trying to stem."" ""How they determine now whether the drug is dangerous, whether it's not dangerous -- that kind of clarity and that kind of guidance, the court did not give us."" Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience. ""Before it happened, I loved school, loved everything about it. You know, I had a 4.0 GPA, honor roll, and now, well, afterwards I never wanted to go to school again."" She is attending college. The case is Safford Unified School District No. 1 v.

68,"LEBANON, Tennessee (CNN)  -- A tumultuous home life forced country music star Gretchen Wilson to grow up quickly. Bernadine Nelson, left, and Gretchen Wilson want to raise awareness about the importance of adult education. ""I was one of those kids that was brought up in kind of a crazy environment in the home, and I just thought I'd be better off if I could get out there and start doing it my way,"" said Wilson, 35. So at 15, she quit school and became a bartender in her Illinois hometown. From that point on, Wilson focused her attention solely on surviving and making music. In 1996, she moved to Nashville to pursue her dream of being a country music singer. Despite setbacks along the way, she found success in 2004 with the release of her first single, ""Redneck Woman."" ""I had big dreams like most local musicians do, but the chances of this having happened for me were slim to none,"" said the Grammy Award winner. ""Without [an] education, I'd have been pouring drinks for the rest of my life."" Until earlier this year, Wilson was one of the millions of Americans who haven't finished their high school education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, 43 million people have dropped out of high school, and one in five Americans are functionally illiterate. Though she was a successful musician, Wilson said she became more determined than ever to finish her education. So, at age 34, she decided to get her GED -- and it was educator Bernadine Nelson who helped her. ""I didn't have to go back and get my GED, but it was something I really needed to complete me as a person,"" Wilson said. Wilson reached out to the local adult education center in Lebanon, Tennessee, where she met Nelson, the center's director. ""[She] greeted me with a huge smile on her face and welcome arms,"" Wilson said. ""She promised me above all that I'd be able to stand in that line and be proud of myself. She became an instant hero in my eyes."" Nelson held true to her word. A year later, Wilson received her GED, crediting the achievement to Nelson's support and encouragement. Together, they're now raising awareness about the importance of an education and encouraging people to say, ""I can do that too."" Though she had been a teacher for decades, Nelson, 62, didn't realize the scope of under-education in America until she began working in adult education roughly six years ago. ""It was an emotional thing to me because I kept thinking, 'What can I do? How can my little job help?' "" Nelson said. ""But I know it does, because every single person I've helped helps the big problem.""  Watch Wilson describe why Nelson is her hero » . In addition to overseeing the center, Nelson has become an outspoken advocate for adult education in Tennessee, speaking to community groups and holding a weekly guest spot on a local radio show. She believes the benefits of an education are priceless. ""Having a GED or high school diploma gives you more self-esteem and a better opportunity for a better job,"" Nelson said. Since 2002, Nelson has helped more than 1,050 students receive their GEDs. And she said she knows that many others will follow in Wilson's footsteps. ""Gretchen came to the program because she wanted to fulfill this void that had been missing for all these years for her,"" Nelson said. ""I don't think she realized how much this would speak to other people. Her fans are legion. If their role model, the Redneck Woman, could get her GED, then ... maybe they could too."" Since Wilson received her GED in May 2008, Nelson said, several people have already called her, citing the singer's achievement as inspiration for obtaining theirs. For Wilson, Nelson's dedication to bringing the importance of education to the forefront of people's lives is making a difference. ""She's bound and determined to put that sense of pride back into these people who felt that they've lost it,"" Wilson said. ""That's not only respectable, it's admirable.""",0.5962355,5624

""Breakfast, boys,"" Daniel Raffo proclaimed as his cats jumped with excitement in their cages. Raffo set down his wheelbarrow, filled with Grade A beef. Using a pitchfork, he fed his Bengal tigers. It's the morning ritual at Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Raffo is the show's tiger trainer. He's a fifth-generation circus performer from Argentina. On this morning, the show awakes in Miami, Florida. ""You get up in the morning; you wash the animal, clean it up; you feed them, then you play with them a bit,"" Raffo said. ""And then during the day, you spend some time with your family."" He lives in a trailer with his family so he can stay close to the tigers. He, wife Andrea and son Davian are all on a two-year tour with Ringling Bros. But why would anyone live on the road like this, with a 4-year-old? Andrea is also part of the circus, performing an aerial ballet, hanging by her hair high above the crowds, just like her mother and grandmother, who taught her the act. ""I can finish my act and then go up and see my son, so it's good, 'cause we're always together,"" Andrea Ayala Raffo said. The Raffos keep a home in Florida but are rarely there. ""Home is actually my trailer, when we travel, and have dinner every night and watch TV. That's really my home,"" Andrea Raffo said. And these lives on wheels come with real family needs. Just outside Section 405 at Miami's American Airlines arena, across from the Mexi-go Taqueria and Nacho Time food stands, school is in session. Jonathan Leiss is a licensed teacher with the circus. He uses a nationally recognized home-schooling curriculum. He pitches a one-room schoolhouse in every city where the show pitches its tent, for all of the school-age children of the circus. School is open five days a week. He teaches all the subjects, and every one of his students gets personal attention. ""I would describe it as a rigorous curriculum,"" he said. ""We don't want to allow anything to slip through the cracks because we're traveling. This is a real school."" Leiss added, ""If I was teaching in a public high school, I could have 120 students. That's a lot less opportunity to really address what each student needs."" Katherine Stuart is one of the students. The 8-year-old is growing up quickly, surrounded by circus people from 32 countries. One of the performers is teaching her Spanish. She says she likes to wash the elephants, and she loves the travel. ""You can see all these different places and what it looks like, and I also wanted to know what each state looked like, so I get to do it,"" she said. Katherine's dad is Mike Stuart, the general manager. With his wife, Mary, and son Tylar, 3, he hits about 36 cities a year. When CNN arrived at his temporary office at the Miami arena, Katherine was reading with Mike. Tylar was with Mom, playing a ""Blues Clues"" game on the computer. ""This is a 24/7 job, so I make time pretty much every day to sit with my kids, go out with my kids,"" Mike Stuart said. The Stuarts, like most of the 350 circus members, live on a train, with all of a home's amenities. But finding a park or a playground is a must for them. ""I have a house in Massachusetts. I probably see it once a year, maybe for a week or two,"" Stuart said. ""But, more or less, we travel on the train. It's year-round, basically. ... So really, home is wherever the circus takes me."" One disadvantage is that the kids do not have a lot of friends to play with. But the family is always together. ""I think there's a lot of people who travel for their jobs, that are not fortunate enough to travel with family, where this job allows us to be able to do that,"" Mary Stuart said. The Stuarts believe that their lives and the lives of their children have been enhanced by the real-world learning experiences. ""Instead of just reading it in books, they're going to see these things, and to me, that's more fulfilling,"" Mike Stuart explained. Citing privacy reasons, the circus did not allow CNN to see the train. With any traveling family, there will inevitably be spiritual needs. Sister Dorothy Fabritze is a full-time circus worker and Catholic nun who holds religion classes, working across cultures, sharing the circus lifestyle. ""I saw that these people needed to find that they too were a parish, that they too were a community,"" she explained. ""We can support and walk with each other in this journey that we call life."" Fabritze arranges for clergy to visit the circus weekly. She's a former missionary who spent 16 years in Papua New Guinea. Here, she says, she hopes to be a biblical presence amid the glitzy backdrop and colorful characters, from acrobats to clowns to animal trainers. ""Some come asking for Bible study. We'll do that. Some come forward and say, 'My child needs the sacrament, with confession and communion. Can you help me?' Of course I can,"" she explained. For about two years, Fabritze also worked backstage, opening and closing the curtain between acts, for 800 shows in two years. She remembers those times as ""God moments."" ""They knew that I'd be there, and they would just come over and in the darkened area just talk to me about whatever they wanted to talk, and wonderful things happened. Wonderful spiritual things happened, just because I was there,"" she said.

COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- At the University of South Carolina, the campus is quiet, but students were still heading to their classes after six students were killed in a beach house fire during the weekend. The school is planning a short ceremony Monday evening to honor the six students who were killed Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. A seventh person killed is believed to be a student at Clemson University. Their identities had not yet been released Monday afternoon.

Pausch, 47, a computer science professor, delivered the lecture, ""Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,"" at Carnegie Mellon in September 2007, a month after being told he had three to six months to live because his cancer had returned. The lanky, energetic Pausch talked about goals he had accomplished, like experiencing zero gravity and creating Disney attractions, and those he had not, including becoming a professional football player. He used rejections he was handed when he applied for jobs at Disney to comment on the importance of persistence.

He discussed his fondness for winning stuffed animals at fairs, showed a slide of them, then -- pretending to be concerned his audience would think the image had been digitally manipulated -- produced them onstage. Donning silly costume items like a vest with arrows sticking out of it and a Mad Hatter's hat, he described working with students as a way to help other people achieve their dreams.

73,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Eric Hahn thought his financial situation was set after he was approved for a private student loan with an 8 percent interest rate to supplement his federal education loans. Eric Hahn, 21, estimates he will be in debt for the next five to seven years for his undergraduate tuition. Just a few weeks later, Hahn, 21, was forced to cash in his savings and investments so he could make his rent and tuition after finding out that the lender, MyRichUncle.com, had suspended its private student loan program. ""Due to continued disruptions in the capital markets, combined with the continued demand we have experienced this year, we are reaching funding capacity limits,"" a message on his cell phone said, mimicking a statement on the company's Web site. The sudden news left Hahn, a senior-year finance major, scrambling to find additional funding after maxing out his borrowing options from the federal government. Eventually, the country's leading student loan provider, Sallie Mae, approved him for a private loan at 12 percent. After he graduates, Hahn estimates it will take him anywhere from five to seven years to repay about $30,000 he will have borrowed by then. ""Money isn't cheap,"" said Hahn, who transferred to Georgia State University in Atlanta from the University of Connecticut last year because the tuition was less expensive. ""The process is time-consuming, and there's also the stress of having to liquidate my investments and wonder where I'm going to find money."" About 8 percent of student borrowers rely on private loans, which tend to be costlier and stricter than federal loans, said Robert Shierman, executive director of the Institute for College Access and Success. In doing so, Hahn and others like him are getting a crash course in market volatility and its effects on the consumer's ability to find money.  Watch how the current economic troubles affect consumers » . MyRichUncle.com is the most recent lender to suspend its private student loan program, joining the ranks of major financial institutions like Wachovia and Bank of America and companies specializing in student loans such as College Loan Corporation and Campus Door, which was backed by Lehman Brothers. MyRichUncle's president and co-founder, Raza Khan, told CNN: ""We are currently working with a number of investors so we can resume loan origination as soon as possible. ""Meanwhile, students and parents should not lose sight of the value of education. Funds do remain available -- we encourage families to do all the homework and research, and to make prudent decisions on borrowing,"" he added in a written statement. Since August 2007, 33 lenders have suspended private loans programs, according to the Web site FinAid.org, which tracks activity in the student loan market.  Unlike federal lending programs, private loans rely on liquidity from investors. Even though private loans are considered strong by industry standards, they are feeling the effects of a turbulent capital market. ""The only reason lenders had to stop making the loans was that they ran out of liquidity,"" said financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz, who created FinAid.org. ""It's a contagion effect of the sub-prime crisis,"" said Kantrowitz. ""It's an overreaction that has affected the student loan market."" With their strong resemblance to consumer loans, where lenders set the terms based on your credit score, financial advisers often recommended private loans as a means of last resort. But with rising tuition and increased enrollment putting a squeeze on the student aid market -- which disbursed about $60 billion in federal funds and $17 billion in private loans last year -- students are turning to private loans after they've exhausted all other avenues, or for expenses that federal aid won't cover. In response, Congress passed legislation this year to increase the maximum amount of federal loans that students can obtain. ""With federal student loan limits increasing, you can borrow now more than last year, regardless of income, assets, collateral or income,"" said Martha Holler, vice president of corporate communications of Sallie Mae. Despite the uncertainty in the capital market, many lenders, including Sallie Mae, are still able to offer private student loans by securing lines of credit and raising liquidity on their own. Holler says other options also exist, from scholarships for skills as random as skateboarding, to tuition payment plans -- an interest-free option that allows borrowers to make payments in monthly installments. But students like Hahn remain on the fringe. Even after being awarded an out-of-state tuition waiver, which lets him pay the same tuition as a resident from Georgia, he says he has borrowed all he can in federal loans. His parents, who are facing their own financial struggles, can't co-sign for a loan with a lower interest rate or better terms. Nevertheless, Hahn has accepted his fate. As school begins, he is returning his focus to his studies. ""It's a pain in the neck, but it is what it is,"" he said in a telephone interview in between classes Wednesday. ""The reason this all happened is due to the credit crisis and the housing crisis. So I guess the lesson is don't hop on what everyone else is doing.""

74,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has given a girl's parents the go-ahead to sue a Massachusetts school district over alleged sexual harassment by another student. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling allows a couple two avenues to pursue claims against their daughter's school district. The justices, in a unanimous ruling, allowed the plaintiffs two avenues to make their claims -- a 1972 law banning gender bias in education and a separate civil rights law enacted 138 years ago. Lisa and Robert Fitzgerald said their then-kindergartner daughter was forced by an older male student to lift her skirt or pull down her underwear. The parents alleged school officials ignored their concerns and refused to discipline the boy. Federal courts had been split over whether the newer law -- known as Title IX -- displaced any claims made under part of the 1871 civil rights law, called ""Section 1983."" The Fitzgeralds lost their initial Title IX claims and an appeals court blocked them from pursuing the other legal strategy. The ruling from the justices now gives the Fitzgeralds the right to continue their lawsuit against school officials. ""We hold that Section 1983 suits based on the Equal Protection Clause remain available to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote. The plaintiffs allege the incidents happened on a school bus in Barnstable, Massachusetts, in the 2000-01 academic year. The child had told her parents that whenever she wore a dress, a third-grader would make her do things she did not want to do. After the mother complained to school officials, the boy denied the allegations. The principal, after interviewing other students and the bus driver, concluded she could not corroborate the girl's version of events. The principal suggested the girl be transferred to another bus as a possible solution. The Fitzgeralds said that amounted to punishing their daughter and said the boy was the one who should be transferred. The local police department also looked into the case but concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the boy. The parents began driving the girl to school and filed a lawsuit, claiming the schools system's response was inadequate. School officials denied wrongdoing and tried to limit the case to Title IX, which applies to public or private schools receiving federal aid. The law is credited, among other things, with helping bring equality in sports participation and funding for college women. ""Our concern was that the school district just didn't take things as seriously as they should,"" said Charles Rothfeld, attorney for the Fitzgeralds. ""They were frustrated by what they perceived as indifference by the school."" Rothfeld said the school's behavior was ""pretty egregious.""

75,"(CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: ""Why are our kids so messed up?"" ""Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?"" ""What's happening in our schools?"" These are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the ""bystander effect"": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it. Unfortunately, this ""What's wrong with our children?"" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening. Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community. Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: ""What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?"" The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus. Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it. Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events. According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, ""I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either."" Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is ""a dark alley near the back side of the school,"" the site of the purported rape. As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area. As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. . Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information. This dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred. Students and families using a hot line in Colorado were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004-06. As of summer 2009, this one hot line fielded 1,687 reports that resulted in crime prevention or intervention. Alert students have also helped prevent replays of the tragedies that occurred at Columbine and Virginia Tech by tipping off school officials. Several years ago, student reports stopped a Columbine-style massacre plot, employing bombs, napalm and automatic weapons, at a high school in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

76,"(CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: ""Why are our kids so messed up?"" ""Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?"" ""What's happening in our schools?"" These are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the ""bystander effect"": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it. Unfortunately, this ""What's wrong with our children?"" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening. Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community. Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: ""What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?"" The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus. Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it. Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events. According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, ""I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either."" Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is ""a dark alley near the back side of the school,"" the site of the purported rape. As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area. As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. . Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information. This dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred. Students and families using a hot line in Colorado were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004-06. As of summer 2009, this one hot line fielded 1,687 reports that resulted in crime prevention or intervention. Alert students have also helped prevent replays of the tragedies that occurred at Columbine and Virginia Tech by tipping off school officials. Several years ago, student reports stopped a Columbine-style massacre plot, employing bombs, napalm and automatic weapons, at a high school in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This year, tips from students and alert teachers and police disrupted a student-massacre plot, featuring pipe bombs and firearms, at Hillside High School in San Mateo, California. Since Columbine, school shootings have been averted in New Bedford, New York, and Covina, California, to name some others. And at Richmond, it was an 18-year-old bystander, overhearing others talking about the incident, who reported the crime.

77,"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- When -- after many visits to doctors and hospitals --- Tian Huiping's son was finally diagnosed with autism, the only advice she was given was to make use of a loophole in China's ""one-child"" policy that allows parents with disabled children to have one more. Tian Huiping considered suicide when she learned her son was autistic. Instead, she opened an autism school. Alone with her son after her husband divorced her, Tian became depressed and desperate enough to consider killing herself and her son, Yang Tao. ""I made a poison for me and my son,"" she said. But when she saw her boy smiling up at her happily, she says she couldn't do it. ""I thought, I have no right to end his life, and I cannot kill myself and leave him."" From that horrible moment 18 years ago, there grew an incredible resolve -- the kind of dogged determination borne of a mother protecting her child. At one of the many hospitals she went to for help in Beijing, Tian came across a small brochure printed by the Taiwan Autism Association, explaining a few basic concepts on how to teach kids with autism.  Watch mom describe being near suicide with autistic child » . She read it over and over again. ""I just tried to work a little bit with my son and another boy we lived with,"" she says. ""And it worked -- a little bit -- but I saw hope."" She rented space in a kindergarten and opened her own school at first, with just six autistic children. She slept on the floor in a store room to save money. Two months later, the kindergarten closed her down. ""We didn't make enough money for them,"" she says. But the children had shown progress, even though the teaching was based on a few simple concepts in a few pages of a brochure. Soon, the word was out. And more parents with autistic children came to Tian  looking for help, all of them with the same fears. ""If my son cannot go to school, what will happen with him? As a mother this is such a big worry."" Fifteen years later, Tian and her Stars and Rain Education Institute for Autism help more than 3,000 children a day through her school and its outreach program. Eighty children of all ages enroll in her school for an 11-week course with their parents -- many of whom travel hundreds of miles from small villages to get help for their children. The parents then return to their villages to try to educate the local population.  Interactive: Autism 101 » . The Chinese government says there are only about 100,000 people with autism in the entire country, but unofficial estimates put the number between 1-2 million people, perhaps even more. Tian says her institute has a list of just 60 doctors nationwide who are capable of diagnosing autism. Fifteen years ago, she says there were just three. Because resources are scarce, the focus at her school is on teaching the parents how to educate their children. They first help parents to accept their child's disability and teach basic information about autism awareness. Programs are individualized for each child, with teachers working on verbal communication, managing tantrums and other early intervention methods. One of the parents is a woman named Fu Jing. It took three years and countless wrong diagnoses, before she finally learned why her son Ruoqi wasn't talking or playing with other kids, she said. When Fu leaned Ruoqi was autistic, her world collapsed. ""I thought about committing suicide with my son. I could not imagine the pain he would suffer when he grew up. All the unfair treatment from society and schoolmates,"" she said. ""As a mother, I felt so much pain."" But now Fu is learning how to communicate with her son, how to raise him, even how to love him. ""The training here strengthens the acceptance of your kids. Honestly speaking, as an ordinary person, I get angry and even shout at him,"" she said. ""But here, they say we have to accept our kids as who they are. I feel that I have changed."" There are no government programs to help parents with autistic children -- and there is no government help for Tian and her school. ""I'm not used to requesting anything from government,"" she says. ""We have grown up in such a situation."" For the past three years, Stars and Rain has been working with Heartspring, a Kansas-based center for children with special needs. Teachers from Beijing have been sent to Wichita, Kansas, for training; and teachers like Connie Coulter have come to Stars and Rain. When she arrived in February, Coulter found a school with almost no resources and without access to the latest research. Some parents, she said, would come up to her and ask about a magic pill or vitamin ""to cure their child."" ""In the villages where they're coming from, they're just viewed as basically throw-away children,"" she said. ""To tell [the parents] and be able to educate them, it was an exhilarating experience to talk to them about the basic understanding of autism.""   Coulter described her time at the school as a ""life-changing experience."" ""There are things that they have taught me about value of family, the passion, the empathy, the sacrifice that I don't see as much in the United States,"" she said. It's a sacrifice these parents feel lucky to make -- because in China, if your child has autism and you want to help, there is almost nowhere else to turn. E-mail to a friend .

78,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Olga A. Mendez, a ground-breaking Puerto Rican politician from New York City, has died after a long battle with cancer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced. Mendez, widely reported to be the first Puerto Rican woman elected to a state legislature in the mainland United States, was 84. ""Olga's election to the state Senate as its first Puerto Rican woman was a tremendous symbol of hope for a community that now had a seat at the table,"" Bloomberg said in a release Wednesday. ""But Olga's life was an inspiration to countless others, because the doors she bravely pushed opened stayed open for everyone else."" Mendez served in the New York state Senate 13 consecutive terms, from 1978 until being defeated in 2004. A long-time Democrat, she had switched to the Republican Party in 2002 and failed to win re-election to her heavily Democratic 28th district, which included East Harlem and parts of the Bronx. ""Mendez was brash, bold and aggressive because she had to be,"" New York's El Diario newspaper said Thursday. ""She cut her teeth in the Senate and became a battle-ready politician. And she balanced what few politicians were able to do well -- an on-the-ground constituency services with the ability to achieve critical legislative negotiations. This, in a Senate that was controlled by Republicans during the entire 26 years she served."" Bloomberg noted Mendez's bipartisanship. ""When I first entered public service eight years ago, Olga sat me down and impressed upon me -- in her inimitable way -- the importance of reaching across partisan lines to do what's right for your constituents,"" the mayor said. ""That's a lesson I carry with me every day."" El Diario noted that ""Mendez successfully fought for an increase in the state's minimum wage, ushered in legislation that provided basic rights to migrant farm workers and secured funding for senior citizen centers. She also fought for resources for early childhood development and gained bipartisan support for affordable housing and economic development initiatives in her district."" Born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, Mendez moved to the Mainland U.S. after receiving a bachelor's degree from the Universidad de Puerto Rico in 1950. She received a master's degree in psychology from the Teacher's College at Columbia University in 1960 and a doctorate's in educational psychology from Yeshiva University in 1975. An early widow, she had no children. Mendez underwent surgery for breast cancer in 1993. ""Olga didn't recoil from public life or attempt to hide her condition,"" Bloomberg said.

79,"(CNN) -- A Chicago, Illinois, nightclub accused of barring six African-American students last week will participate in a rally against discrimination late next month, the senior class president of Missouri's Washington University said Wednesday. Fernando Cutz, 21, said the group and Original Mother's in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood had reached an agreement that would also see the nightclub sponsoring four fundraisers and its managers attend diversity training classes. ""What we are looking to do is to turn this negative into a positive,"" the text of Cutz's remarks said. ""To make sure that all of us learn from what happened to these six students in Chicago 10 days ago and that we move forward, together, in a productive manner. ... ""We would also like to show that the best way of fighting discrimination can be by reaching out and extending a helpful hand to those who need it,"" Cutz said at a news conference. The club has also agreed to a private apology to the six students and a public apology to the  senior class, which was in Chicago for a two-day class trip. The students complained to state and federal agencies after six African-American members from their senior class trip celebration were denied admission to the club on October 17. Bar personnel cited dress code violations -- specifically baggy jeans -- in barring the African-American students, Cutz said. At one point, a white student and a black student exchanged jeans to see what would happen. The white student was admitted while his classmate still was kept outside, Cutz said. After the students' news conference, an attorney representing the club said the bar would be working with the students to fight discrimination and will issue an apology because they had a bad experience at Mother's. But Brad Grayson said the club does not believe it discriminated against the group. ""There was no intention to admit white kids with baggy jeans and exclude black kids with baggy jeans,"" he told the Chicago Tribune newspaper. In his remarks Wednesday, Cutz said the students wanted to avoid being ""caught up in the hype"" of the situation and ""forget the values that we are truly fighting for."" Mother's representatives will speak at the rally, which will be held in in Chicago in late November, he said. The celebration at Original Mother's had been arranged with the bar in advance by the student class board, which includes two of the African-American students who later were denied entry, Cutz said. He said he was already inside the bar with some 200 other students, none of whom are African-American, when the first group of African-American classmates arrived. Cutz said he quickly learned that the manager of the bar had denied the six students entry, and he said the manager told the students their baggy pants violated the bar's dress code. Cutz, who is white, said he confronted the manager. ""These six [students] were better-dressed than I was,"" Cutz told CNN. He told the students to ""go back to the hotel and change."" But the manager of the bar stepped in to say that he had made his decision and that the six men could not return to the bar even if they changed clothes, Cutz said. The students became ""more agitated"" and ""set up an experiment,"" Cutz said. Class Treasurer Regis Murayi, who is black, exchanged jeans with a white student, Jordan Roberts, who -- being 3 inches shorter than Murayi -- looked ""substantially baggy."" Roberts approached the same manager who had turned away the African-American students, paid the entry fee and was allowed in, Cutz said.

80,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- She is one of the world's most likeable and photogenic leaders, has her own YouTube channel, and is determined to change the face of learning in the Middle East. Queen Rania's down-to-earth personality has won hearts and minds all over the world. She is also, according to you, the most inspirational leader featured on CNN's ""The Spirit of..."" in 2008. Thousands of CNN Web site users voted to award her the honor for her matchless energy working with Jordan's young people, ahead of luminaries such as peace advocate Kofi Annan, activist Wangari Maathai and environmentalist James Lovelock. This is Queen Rania's second award in as many months. In November, she was presented with the first ever YouTube Visionary Award for her bold use of the video-sharing network to discuss stereotypes about Islam and the Arab world. The channel fielded questions from young people about all aspects of Islamic culture. She could not be present to personally receive the honour at YouTube's Live event in San Francisco, but her pop-culture-savvy pre-recorded acceptance speech showed her to be possibly the coolest queen alive. She delighted viewers with a lighthearted top-ten list of reasons for registering her own YouTube channel, which included, ""Because I didn't have enough friends on Facebook,"" and ""Because anything Queen Elizabeth can do I can do better."" The experimental venture gained her a faithful online following, and since then the channel has become a platform for entertaining, non-hostile debate. It is exactly this willingness to set aside her royal image and interact with the public that her fans say has shown Queen Rania's dedication to bringing about change. She first entered the international spotlight 15 years ago after marrying Abdullah II bin al-Hussein, the then future king of Jordan. In 1999, she was proclaimed Queen, the world's youngest at age 28. She wasted little time in applying herself to various causes, and soon made her name as an engaging advocate for women's rights and moderate Islam, and as a heavy investor in youth. The 38-year-old mother of four has said that she cares about her people as if they were her own children, and wants to ensure as many of them as possible get the most out of school. Queen Rania may be light-hearted in some of her approaches, but she is very serious when it comes to revitalizing education in the Middle East. She has made closing the Middle East's ""knowledge divide"" -- the gap in knowledge that has grown as a result of people in richer countries having more access to computers, the Internet and education than those in poorer countries -- a top priority over the next few years in the hope that it will unlock the economic potential of the region's population. Queen Rania certainly has a challenge on her hands. Earlier this year, the Arab League Educational Cultural and Scientific Organisation revealed that nearly one in three between the ages of 15 and 45 is illiterate. Alongside promoting equal rights for men and women and the importance of literacy, Queen Rania has strived to convince both the education and private sectors that existing education systems need reinvigoration. She has repeatedly called for creative instruction and explorative learning to be embraced in the classroom. In April of this year, Queen Rania launched the Madrasati (""My School"") project, which encourages Jordanians to get their neediest schools back on their feet. Under the program, communities are working with the public and private sectors to raise funds and recruit volunteers to renovate school facilities and provide school supplies and equipment. This is expected to improve the learning environment for children, and ultimately have a ripple effect on the neighborhoods where the schools are located. Queen Rania's campaigns in various areas have helped to inspire other Middle Eastern policy-makers to see globalization in a more positive light -- a truly inspiring leader.",0.5783527,4590
81,"(CNN) -- Elmo and Gordon want you to wash your hands so you don't catch the flu. Smokey Bear, the Ad Council's most famous icon, has moved from 1940s posters to his own Facebook page. The ""Sesame Street"" stalwarts star in a series of public service announcements to teach children healthy habits in the face of the H1N1 flu virus. The Muppet and the man (actor Roscoe Orman) are the latest in a long line of characters -- human and not -- to star in public service announcements co-sponsored by the Advertising Council. The Ad Council, the charitable arm of the advertising industry, employs the same top-flight talent that creates ads for Budweiser, Coca-Cola and other familiar brands.  Watch Elmo and Gordon give the pitch » . Growing beyond its early ""Buy War Bonds"" posters and Smokey TV spots, today's Advertising Council is moving into social media ""in a very big way,"" said Peggy Conlon, the organization's CEO. ""There's all kinds of ways the Advertising Council finds its target audience on the web,"" she said, noting that the group has its own YouTube channel. A marketing executive endorses the approach. ""If your target is young people, television really doesn't make a lot of sense now if they're spending hours on the Internet, hours in social media,"" said Ben Kunz, director of strategic planning for Mediassociates, a media planning and Internet strategy firm. ""You need to find a way to reach them in the media that they consume."" The ""holy grail"" is to go viral, as people pass the message around because they like it or think it's important, Kunz said. A gory, four-minute British PSA on the dangers of texting while driving has received nearly 600,000 views on YouTube in less than two weeks, fueled in part by Facebook and Twitter links.  Watch how the PSA has changed minds » . ""If you can leverage these new human networks using mobile and Facebook and Twitter and blogs to disseminate your message, that's the real home run,"" he said. ""But the only way to do that is to give people a real reason to become engaged."" One campaign that tries to do that is called Boost Up, aimed at encouraging students to complete high school. Louis Caldera, who at the time was secretary of the Army, initiated the project with a call to the Ad Council because of a lack of qualified recruits. ""There was a disconnect between the societal message that said, 'Go to college,' and [the Army's] message, which said, 'Don't go to college, join the military,'"" Caldera, a West Point alumnus, told CNN. Caldera wanted people to think of the Army as a leader in education issues, not an alternative to schooling, and he sought the Ad Council's help. ""We absolutely did not want people to think this was about recruiting,"" he said. The council put together a campaign intended for all students, with a particular goal of reaching Latinos, for whom dropout rates are higher than for other groups. ""It really encourages people -- both adults and their peers -- to give these kids the encouragement that they need to really reach within themselves and find the personal resolve that they need to overcome life's difficulties and graduate from high school,"" Conlon said. ""It's a really smart campaign. I think it's very genuine, and it resonates really well with kids."" Although dropout rates generally and among Latinos remain high, ""I think this is making a contribution to creating the environment in which more students can be successful,"" said Caldera, now a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank. President Obama will appear in the latest series of Boost Up PSAs, to begin airing next week. The Ad Council and its partners measure a campaign's success by how much donated media a campaign attracts. Media outlets will run an ad more if it helps them retain audiences, Conlon said. The Ad Council receives $1.8 billion a year in donated media, she said.  Watch some notable Ad Council PSAs » . The council also measures response to phone numbers or Web sites promoted in the ads and tracks awareness through before-and-after surveys, Conlon said. ""We can watch the needle move over time,"" she said. ""It's very scientific; it's very empirical."" But not every campaign is a home run, Conlon admitted. ""We kind of laugh about the Gerald Ford 'Whip Inflation Now' with his big WIN buttons,"" she said. ""The Advertising Council did that campaign, and for many reasons that were mostly cultural, it completely bombed."" And then there are those campaigns that get mixed reviews. ""The 'Just Say No' campaign was probably the biggest success,"" Kunz said. ""I think it led to something like the creation of 5,000 clubs around the country, and there was a definite decline in drug use."" Conlon laughed. ""It was a terrible campaign,"" she said. ""And the reason was not because we shouldn't be telling young people not to use drugs, but it's just not as simple as that. It stripped it down to such a simplistic message that it had terrible reaction on the part of kids."" Campaigns are about educating the public on the facts of an issue, Conlon said. ""You have to get their attention, and that's where the creativity comes in,"" Conlon said. ""It can't be just lecturing or just exposing the message to people. In this cluttered media environment, you really have to have something that breaks through."" One creative spot that has broken through on an emotional level depicts a grown man practicing cheerleading moves on a sidewalk. The humorous ad promotes fathers' involvement in their children's lives. ""Being a good dad sometimes requires shamelessness,"" said Bill Ludwig, creative director at the Campbell Ewald ad agency in Detroit, Michigan, which created the spot. ""The idea is that the smallest moments can have the biggest impact on a child's life. Just spend a little time with your kid."" The father-daughter message touched Facebook user Jessica Gonzales, a graduate student in San Diego, California. ""There's plenty of ads telling us what to buy, how to look, etc., but few remind us how to just be ... and how to be good to one another,"" Gonzales said. ""The ad's tagline is 'Take time to be a dad,' but that message could be easily translated to so many other roles: Take time to be a friend, a mentor, a positive influence."" That's the kind of response the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is hoping to get from co-sponsoring the ""Sesame Street"" flu campaign. ""We are doing everything we can to protect public health and teach children how they can stay healthy and safe,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

Now in its fifth year, the camp is a passion for the Grammy Award-winning artist, who each year gives more than a hundred teens from underserved communities across the country the opportunity to learn about the entertainment and sports industries. Thomas Springer, a 17-year-old Atlanta, Georgia, resident, has participated in the camp for four years and said he wants to use his talent in filmmaking and what he has learned at Camp New Look to help his community. ""Before I came to camp, I didn't think I had a voice in my community and that I could do anything based on my age,"" Springer said. ""The camp let me know that no matter what your age, no matter what you do, you can make an impact on your community."" Usher came to fame as a teen and has sold millions of records, including the hit singles ""Yeah"" and ""Confessions II."" His success has allowed him to become part owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team and to launch his own line of fragrances for men and women. The camp, the singer said, teaches participants the business aspects of the entertainment and sports industries and imparts the importance of being service-oriented. A selection committee selects campers that are nominated by partner organizations in various cities across the country. Now the father of two young boys, Usher said he is also enriched by the camp's experience. ""It makes me a better man. It makes me a better individual,"" he said. ""There's a difference between hard work and heart work, and this would represent heart work.""  Watch Usher talk about his camp » . As a youngster, Usher participated in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and he said it helped shape his ideas about mentoring. ""I think that the Boys & Girls Club is a very positive environment for kids,"" he said. ""It's another place that allows you to be a product of your experience. I encountered a lot of people who became mentors for me there."" At this year's closing ceremony for Usher's Camp New Look, held at the Alliance Theater at Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, the energy level was high as campers and their family members walked a red carpet alongside some of Usher's celebrity friends, including NBA star Alonzo Mourning and San Francisco 49er Allen Rossum. The free, residential camp held for two weeks every summer in Atlanta is an outgrowth of Usher's New Look Foundation, which he established to empower at-risk youth by giving them the skills necessary to enter careers in the sports and entertainment industries and working with them to provide employment opportunities. Mourning said Usher is one who understands that ""to whom much is given, much is required."" ""The service that Usher is providing for these kids with these educational opportunities and expanding their lives to a whole new level, it's important that we all rally around these particular causes and support these initiatives,"" Mourning said. Gabrielle Brou, 16, a first-year camper from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, who aspires to be an actress, said there were countless opportunities at camp to network with successful people who are living the lives she hopes to achieve. ""Once I found out that there were ways I could better myself in acting, learn the business and also give back ... I decided that this camp would be really great for me,"" she said. ""I would love to do it again next year."" Having a day set aside for the campers and their families to revel in all that they have achieved and their future possibilities left Usher with a huge smile on his face. ""It's really good to see them be able to live out their dreams,"" he said.",0.5779312,5378
84,"DOBBS FERRY, New York (CNN) -- Jude Ndambuki teaches high school chemistry, but when he's not in class, you might find him Dumpster diving for discarded computers. Jude Ndambuki's Help Kenya Project provides refurbished computers for Kenyan students. For the past eight years, the Kenya native has been refurbishing computers, printers and other electronic educational resources otherwise headed for landfills, then sending them to grateful students back home. ""The children in Kenya have very few resources; even a pencil is very hard to get,"" said Ndambuki, 51, who lives in the New York City suburb of Dobbs Ferry. ""Being one of the kids who actually experienced very dire poverty in Kenya, I feel any part that I can play to make the life of kids better, I better do it."" In lieu of compensation for the considerable time, expertise and expenses he devotes to his Help Kenya Project, Ndambuki asks that recipients plant 100 trees for every computer they receive. By connecting computer recycling, educational development and environmental conservation, he hopes to encourage a greener, more prosperous future for his country. The Help Kenya Project has provided more than 2,000 refurbished computers to Kenya's schools and planted more than 150,000 trees.  Watch Ndambuki and his Help Kenya Project in action » . ""Many of the schools that I give computers [to] in Kenya have not seen computers before. So we're bringing them closer to the development,"" explained Ndambuki, adding that without this opportunity, some of those schools might have gone another 20 years without touching a computer. ""It's like giving the kids new life,"" he said. ""Computers are getting new life, and trees are being planted to bring a new life, too. It's all connected."" Finding treasure in the trash . ""Growing up was not easy"" for Ndambuki, who said he became a teacher to help children who are struggling the way he did. The second of eight children raised by a widowed mother, Ndambuki attended school at the expense of his older brother; he quit because the family couldn't afford both boys' education. Ndambuki was appointed principal at a Kenya high school where he befriended American exchange students who helped bring him to the United States to further his education. In 1997, he arrived with his wife and two children for his new teaching post in a Dobbs Ferry private school. On a late-night walk home from continuing-education classes, he passed a computer thrown out on the curb for trash collection. He brought it home, where he found it was in perfect working order. It struck Ndambuki that the machines ending up in landfills could offer life-altering opportunities for children in his homeland. ""It all came together,"" recalled Ndambuki. ""Kids in Kenya need to know technology. It's the way of the world, and they will be left behind without it. I am determined to prepare them for office jobs instead of field work."" The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates that 98 percent of Kenya's public primary schools and 80 percent of public high schools lack computers. And 70 percent of Kenya's energy is derived from charcoal and firewood culled from the country's forests, according to the UN Environment Programme. ""There's a lot of trees that are cut every year,"" Ndambuki said. ""We find the land becomes bare, a lot of erosion of the soil takes place. So we need trees to be planted."" The trees also help protect the computers from dust blowing in through the classroom windows, he said. Ndambuki ships a 40-foot container loaded with hundreds of refurbished computers to Kenya for distribution once a year. He and a few of his chemistry students often tinker with computer parts after classes, spending hours refurbishing, packing and preparing the shipments. Each Kenya school receives an average of five computers. To ensure that private data of the computers' former owners is not accessible to new users, the Help Kenya Project wipes that information from the machines, loads them with necessary memory and restores them to functioning order. Every two years, Ndambuki visits recipient schools to show teachers and students the basics of computer programming and maintenance. Some of his American students accompany him and help teach the computer classes.  Watch Ndambuki trade technology for trees in his native Kenya village » . In addition, Ndambuki joins students, teachers and members of their communities to plant trees. ""While I'm doing this project, I feel so much connection with the kids in Kenya,"" he said. ""I'm not just gone to America to enjoy the good life. This has been a very nice bridge for me so that I can feel I've not left them."" Want to get involved?

85,"(CNN)  -- The sagging economy is taking a bite out of federal school-meal subsidies as more students take advantage of free or low-price breakfasts and lunches, nutritionists say in a report released Thursday. About 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program, a group reports. The School Nutrition Association surveyed more than 130 school nutrition directors from 38 states to produce its report, ""Saved by the Lunch Bell: As Economy Sinks, School Nutrition Program Participation Rises."" The nonprofit organization said that about 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program in 2008-09 than in the previous school year. That represents an average increase of 2.5 percent from 2007-08, the report says. These numbers hold true despite a slight decline in the number of students enrolled in public schools this school year, according to the study. More than three-quarters of the districts surveyed reported a rise in the number of students eating free meals under the U.S. Department of Agriculture program, the report says. Many of the school district employees who monitor the food programs complain that the federal subsidies fall far short of the rising costs. According to the association, the estimated average cost to prepare a school meal is $2.90, but the federal reimbursement is $2.57. School lunch programs are experiencing a potential loss of at least $4.5 million per school day, based on 30 million school lunches provided, the group says. The good news, according to association President Katie Wilson, is that ""this year, when hunger is more common, more students are able to eat a balanced, nutritious meal at school."" Meals served under the USDA programs must meet nutrition guidelines based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. For lunches, that means no more than 30 percent of calories can come from fat and fewer than 10 percent from saturated fat.",0.5712165,3074

87,"(CNN) -- I finally said goodbye to some old buddies. Omar (played by Michael K. Williams), ""The Wire's"" legendary stickup artist, hunts for a rival with his shotgun. One of them shot a woman at point-blank range after complimenting her on her hair. Another person maimed a rival with his shotgun. A third stole from his sister to finance his drug habit. Their names are as twisted as their deeds: Snot-Boogie, Bubbles, Dukie. And if I ever introduced you to them, you probably wouldn't be able to understand them. Their talk is filled with a bruising street poetry that's hard to decipher unless you've lived in their West Baltimore neighborhood -- as I once did. My ""friends"" are some of my favorite characters on the HBO series, ""The Wire."" HBO (which, like CNN, is a Time Warner division) released the complete, five-season box set two weeks ago. The show focuses on a detective unit's quest  to take down a ruthless drug crew, but it grapples with bigger themes: the collapse of public schools, the disintegration of working-class America and political corruption. Critics say ""The Wire"" offers the most realistic depiction of America's inner-city subculture ever seen. I decided to test that claim because I grew up in the West Baltimore community where ""The Wire"" is set. After watching all five seasons, my take on the show is ambivalent. Some of ""The Wire"" is real, but not in the ways you might expect. 'How do I get from here to the rest of the world?' ""The Wire's"" most unsettling scene for me took place in season four. It involved a murder  -- of a gentle teenager's spirit. The character's name is Dukie, and he brought back memories of some people I knew. Dukie is lost. He has no family, his public school is paralyzed by violence and he's not tough enough to make it on the streets. He has a gift for computers but doesn't know what to do with his ability. Dukie looks one day for help from ""Cutty,"" an ex-con who runs a boxing gym in their neighborhood. Cutty tells Dukie that ""the world is bigger"" than the violent neighborhood both live in. ""How do I get from here to the rest of the world?"" Dukie asks Cutty. ""I wish I knew,"" Cutty sighs, and walks away. Why did Cutty give Dukie such a hopeless answer? Maybe it's because some people who never lived in a neighborhood like ""The Wire"" confuse hopelessness for authenticity. Yeah, I could shock you with stories of violence, but it's so easy to slip from revelation to titillation. I start off telling you a story about how tough my school was, and soon I'm shooting it out with five drug dealers who want to steal my homework. But I never remember West Baltimore being so hopeless. A man like Cutty wouldn't tell a young man that he had no way out -- adults rallied around kids with potential. I even checked with some childhood friends -- one who is now an undercover police officer who literally works a ""wire"" for the Baltimore Police Department -- and we all agreed that ""The Wire's"" bleakness was exaggerated. ""They made it seem like we grew up in Bosnia,"" my friend, another ""Wire"" fan, told me. Perhaps I had the luck of timing, or, to paraphrase one ""Wire"" character, I left  just before ""the game got more fierce."" I'm 44. I grew up on a street connecting two notorious Baltimore landmarks -- North Avenue and Frederick Douglass High School. Douglass is a school so bleak that PBS recently aired a documentary on its dismal state. North Avenue is known for its liquor stories and shootings. I left my neighborhood for good in the 1980s before crack cocaine really hit. Still, I shared some of the same struggles as some ""Wire"" characters. I spent much of my childhood in the equivalent of foster homes. I never really knew my mother. My father was an on-and-off-again presence. But my community was filled with what Barack Obama calls the ""quiet heroes."" (Obama reportedly is a big fan of ""The Wire."") There was my high school tennis coach. The dignified deacons in my church. The retired steelworker who watched Orioles baseball games on his porch next door. Relatives, teachers, even summer job programs (one gave me my first exposure to journalism) -- all inspired me. Yet those quiet heroes seem fated to fail in ""The Wire."" The show implies that only a fantastic few ever escape the streets. What Cutty could have told Dukie . Despite my misgivings, I love ""The Wire."" The dialogue crackles, the characters are rich and the minute ways it captures how Baltimoreans move and talk is uncanny. But the ""Complete"" story isn't the whole story. ""The Wire"" did, however, nail one childhood memory for me. The most realistic moment in ""The Wire"" for me didn't take place during any violent showdown. It took place in a steakhouse. The scene involved a ""Wire"" character called ""Bunny"" Colvin, a major in the Baltimore Police Department. Colvin helps run an experimental program for problem students at a local high school. One night, he decides to take three of a school's most disruptive students to a steakhouse in downtown Baltimore. The kids are loud and brash, but they're petrified when they have to sit down in a fancy restaurant filled with white people. They can't function and end up leaving the restaurant, still hungry and angry. I could relate. When I was asked in high school to join an academic team that would compete on television against elite, white high schools in Baltimore, I said no. When I attended my first year in college, I wouldn't speak in class and stopped going because I was so intimidated being around people who could actually speak proper English. I almost flunked out. I felt like an imposter. Sometimes, it's not enough to give kids who come from a world like ""The Wire"" the chance to get out. They also have to be convinced that they deserve it. I almost sabotaged myself because I wanted to go back to what was familiar. Even though the familiar was depressing, it was all I knew. Now I know something different because a lot of people convinced me that I deserved to be in that other world. I wish Cutty would have done the same for Dukie. I wish he would have told him he would find a way from ""here to the rest of the world."" I hope the real-life Dukies know that. They deserve a chance to say goodbye to that world, too.",0.56799406,8153
88,"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- When we requested an interview with members of the Communist Youth League, I expected an army of suits with well-rehearsed answers. Instead, we met three students casually dressed in jeans, just 18 to 23 years old. Christina Zhang wants to be a linguistics teacher or professor. She plans to attend graduate school. The interview was arranged by the State Council Information Office, in advance of the upcoming 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Unlike many government-sanctioned shoots, it was not carefully choreographed or closely monitored. The students did arrive with a ""minder"" of sorts, but he was no older than them and didn't interrupt the conversation. We sat down for tea at Ritan Park in downtown Beijing. My questions seemed to be more sensitive than they expected, but the students remained poised and answered every one. All of the students are members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, the same organization that launched the successful careers of Chinese President Hu Jintao and many of China's other top leaders. ""I think Communism is an ideal state of society that everyone should pursue,"" said Natalie Chen, an 18-year-old freshman and finance major at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management. ""In the Communist society, everything is fair in economics, in politics, in education. Everybody has equal opportunity and that's a great society."" ""Do you think everything is fair in China?"" I asked Natalie. ""At present I have to say no,"" she said. ""But, we are of course making progress towards it.""  Watch Chang's interview with the students » . Young students like Chen are the future of the Chinese Communist Party, which now is the largest political party in the world with 75 million members. It has come a long way. In 1949, the Communist Party was a group of mostly revolutionary farmers, who came to power on the heels of civil war.  See how China has changed over 60 years » . ""The party was a rag tag organization you might say,"" said David Shambaugh, a visiting fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and political science professor at George Washington University. ""They had no experience in ruling, but a lot of experience in fighting and they were faced with a number of problems of how to set up a government and run the country."" The first three decades of Communist rule were tumultuous, marred by backward isolation and a destructive Cultural Revolution. However, the next 30 years transformed China from the inside out, with the implementation of new economic goals and gradual openness to the outside world. The Communist Party now is largely credited with delivering the country from isolation to economic prosperity. Despite this achievement, perhaps the party's most astounding achievement in 60 years is, quite simply, surviving as the one and only political party in a massive country. ""To be adaptable and flexible is a path to survival,"" said Shambaugh. ""So this has been a very adaptable, and I would argue, eclectic party, borrowing bits and pieces from different political systems all around the world and studying other political systems."" Yet, in being so adaptable, analysts say the party has run the risk of having a lot of slogans and little substance. Slogans such as ""the scientific mode of development,"" ""socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" and ""harmonious society"" often cannot be explained by the average Chinese citizen. ""These are all current slogans, but people are not really sure what they mean,"" Shambaugh said. Indeed some of the party's youngest members provided vague answers when asked for what exactly the Communist Party stands. ""I think we have a goal,"" said 23-year-old Christina Zhang, an undergraduate in linguistics at Beijing Normal University. ""That is to reach a harmonious society. That is our dream ... I believe we are sure to realize our dream."" ""We discuss science, we discuss thought, we discuss everything,"" added Lin De-yuan, a 23-year-old first-year graduate student in Marxist studies at the Chinese Youth University of Political Sciences. He also suggested I read ""the book by Karl Marx,"" referring to the Communist Manifesto. China's younger generation has been criticized for caring too much about securing good jobs instead of about policy and politics. These days, it is widely regarded that many young people join the party, not because they share Communist ideals, but because it looks good on their resumes. Chen, Zhang and Lin denied joining the party for personal gain. Chen plans to become a banker or a politician, Zhang aspires to be a teacher and Lin dreams of becoming an NBA referee. However, they do acknowledge joining the party may have some benefits and some members actively use their party credentials to achieve certain career goals. ""Admittedly, some people join the party with their own purpose of getting a good job, or getting a promotion,"" Chen said. ""But that's why we are still having a fierce battle with corruption in the party."" In fact, corruption is one of the biggest challenges the Communist Party will face in the years ahead. Young Communists like Chen, Zhang and Lin will be responsible for rising to these types of challenges and shaping the party's future. Their generation may determine whether the Communist Party is still China's one and only ruling party 60 years from now.",0.5658334,6706
89,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Going to the prom is a highlight in many teenagers' lives. But attending a prom isn't always an option for some young people, including those with special needs. Alex Gonzales passes under the Marines' sword arch Saturday in Washington as he arrives at the prom. That's where Helen McCormick comes in. ""We are dreaming for children who are excluded from their proms, and ... you're going to see people walk through the doors who are going to be just absolutely mesmerized,"" said McCormick, president of a Virginia-based nonprofit called The House, Inc. For the past four years, McCormick has organized a prom specifically for children with special needs. This year's prom, dubbed ""The Cinderella Ball,"" was held Saturday night at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington. More than 150 teens attended the gala, where they were greeted by 41 Marines. Each one of the teens went down a red carpet, under a Marine Corps sword arch, before being seated for dinner.  Watch scenes from the spectacular prom » . ""The children that will be coming are various disabled children with kidney (ailments), children that are literally terminally ill, children with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and autism,"" McCormick said before the event. Norman Gonzales brought his 13-year-old son, Alex. ""Their social life is very limited at school and outside school as well, so something like this is very good because they come to a place where they find themselves with people that they can relate to,"" Gonzales said. This was Alex Gonzales' first prom and he said he had a great time. ""Coming to an event like this -- I think it's a great experience,"" he said.

They get to dress up and feel really beautiful and have this night dedicated to them,"" Sparks said. Most of the teens attending the prom were accompanied by a parent or friend. Some of them brought dates. It was a night many of them said they wouldn't forget anytime soon. Victor Padgett attended the festivities with his daughter, Dede.

90,"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN)  -- Argentina's capital city was beset by strikes Thursday, with teachers, doctors and transit employees refusing to work over money matters. Teachers and doctors in Buenos Aires went on strike Wednesday and are scheduled to go back to work Friday, the government-run Telam news agency and other outlets reported. Subway workers will go on strike Thursday night for a few hours, they said. This is the fourth work stoppage in the past six months for doctors. Only emergency cases are being treated. The doctors are not only seeking better salaries, but also improvements to the public health system. They are protesting ""the lack of money in the public system, the possibility that the health budget will be reduced by 500 million pesos (about $130 million), the lack of professionals, the lack of labor to solve the problems in Argentina's public health,"" said Alicia Kobylarz of the Federal Syndicate of Health Workers. The nation's public hospitals treat the poor and needy. Health professionals want the government to employ more doctors to meet rising patient loads and an increase in diseases and epidemics such as H1N1 flu and dengue fever. The hospitals depend on funding from the provinces, leading to major differences in each area's needs and what local health care facilities can offer. ""Provinces that have petroleum income, for example, are provinces that have better budgets, that have better hospitals"" said Aldo Neri, a former national health minister. ""There is much inequality in the treatment that the poor receive in Argentinean public hospitals depending on which province they live in. That's why I say the inequalities have increased."" The current health minister, Juan Manzur, said next year's health budget will have an increase of more than 15 percent, greater than the national budget, which will have a 12.4 percent increase. Teachers also want greater pay and announced Thursday they would go back on strike Tuesday because of failed talks with Buenos Aires Education Director Mario Oporto. The teachers say they want their raises by year's end. Oporto said there's no money for raises now, the official Telam news agency reported. ""The province's posture is very clear: There won't be raises in 2009 because there already have been,"" Oporto told a radio station, according to Telam. ""We're sorry about the work stoppage, and we are ready to keep working. This time we are very firm: There will be no raises in 2009."" Daniel Scioli, governor of Buenos Aires Province, said public education ""is our top priority"" but also emphasized there would be no raises this year, the news agency reported. Teachers' union leaders complained Thursday that government officials went to schools Wednesday to find out which teachers were there and which had joined the work stoppage, Telam said. Subway workers in Buenos Aires announced they will walk off the job at 7 p.m. Thursday. They, too, want pay raises. Educators also are on strike in neighboring Chile, where professors say they are owed a ""historic debt."" The indefinite strike entered its fourth day Thursday and negotiations are scheduled to resume Friday. Jaime Gajardo, president of Chile's College of Professors, told a local TV station there has been improvement in negotiations with the government and the talks could advance noticeably in the next few days. Pablo Zalaquett, the mayor of Santiago, the capital of Chile, said the two sides are closer on a pay bonus the professors want. CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.",0.5602569,8412
91,"(CNN) -- I have vivid memories of childhood. The 5-year-old girl with endless questions; she wanted to discover the secrets of the entire world within minutes. She dreamed of being a doctor once, an engineer another time, and a mother of lovely kids. A dreamer, this is how I would describe the little girl Reem. Reem is a 22-year-old student living in Gaza City. Days passed fast. Reem couldn't remember a lot of them, but she had some moments left in her memory -- usually the happy moments of her life -- and those memories were the basis for today's Reem, the 22-year-old girl who is ME. I remember how happy I was when my teacher announced to the school that I was first in my class. I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet. I can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration. I can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth » . Sometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place. But life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school. I was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media. All my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally. My ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian. Usually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be. It's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom. I found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States and whom I contact through the Global Citizen Corps. I have realized how similar Palestinian youth are to youth all over the world. Catherine likes some of the food I like, and she loves swimming just like I do.

92,"(CNN) -- I have vivid memories of childhood. The 5-year-old girl with endless questions; she wanted to discover the secrets of the entire world within minutes. She dreamed of being a doctor once, an engineer another time, and a mother of lovely kids. A dreamer, this is how I would describe the little girl Reem. Reem is a 22-year-old student living in Gaza City. Days passed fast. Reem couldn't remember a lot of them, but she had some moments left in her memory -- usually the happy moments of her life -- and those memories were the basis for today's Reem, the 22-year-old girl who is ME. I remember how happy I was when my teacher announced to the school that I was first in my class. I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet. I can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration. I can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth » . Sometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place. But life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school. I was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media. All my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally. My ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian. Usually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be. It's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom. I found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States and whom I contact through the Global Citizen Corps. I have realized how similar Palestinian youth are to youth all over the world. Catherine likes some of the food I like, and she loves swimming just like I do. There are also lovely differences between us: I tried to cook what she taught me once, and she is learning Arabic now. Maybe our lifestyle is different. I focus on my own development; I spend most of my time working to become a more qualified person with more knowledge and skills.

93,"(MENTAL FLOSS) -- College admissions are competitive, and not just from the student's side. Sure, sometimes it's hard to get into the college of your choice, but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants. Davidson college students don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service. While some colleges boast about class sizes, graduate fellowships, and endowment growth rates, this sort of info is likely to bore the 17-year-old students they're wooing. Instead, some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students, often in the form of free services. While the cost of these ""free"" perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills, when a family's spending upwards of $40,000 a year for school, it can't hurt to help them feel like they're getting something for nothing. Here are a few you might be jealous of: . 1. Free laundry . Nothing's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study, party, or sleep, only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry. Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them. Since 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them. The laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms. As if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges . 2. Free skiing . Michigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime. 3. Free computers . At my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate. While there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly. Mental Floss: 12 college classes we wish our schools offered . 4. Free theater tickets . Nothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house, so if tickets are moving slowly, why not fill the seats with college students? NYU's Ticket Central can wrangle Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values, but sometimes, the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds. Ticket Central also boasts that it can get students into Knicks games for as little as $12 and into Mets games for just $3. Of course, the way those teams have played in the last year or so, that offer might scare off more prospective students than it entices. 5. Personalized birthday cakes . College birthdays are often all sorts of debauched fun, but at least in my experience, they were often sorely lacking in quality cake. Sure, sometimes you'd get a pan full of Betty Crocker-ed good intentions cooked in a dorm oven, which are precisely calibrated to burn cakes' edges while leaving the center liquid, but it was rare to see a real birthday cake. Ohio University's dining services can fix that, though, by allowing students' parents to join the Birthday Club. For $18, parents can make sure their kid gets a personalize birthday cake and all of the plates, napkins, and forks they'll need to share it with their friends. 6. Cheap golf . College students who want to golf on a tight budget often have to resign themselves to finding the rattiest municipal course they can find and hoping they survive the ordeal. Students at Stanford, though, have access to the Stanford Golf Course, a legendary course that's hosted such greats as Tom Watson and Tiger Woods since it opened in 1930. Only students, alumni, faculty, and their guests can enjoy the course's picturesque views of San Francisco, and for guests the price is pretty steep, up to $110 a round. Students, though, get a great deal on greens fees; they can get in a full round for just $25. Mental Floss: 12 star-powered college roommate pairs .

95,"GAINESVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- When 19-year-old Reid Overton wants to smoke a cigarette on his college campus, he has to walk to a distant parking lot and get into his car, but he doesn't seem to mind. ""Even as a smoker, I don't like to walk past a cloud of smoke,"" he says. Reid Overton, a freshman at Gainesville State College in Georgia, heads to his car when he wants a smoke. Overton is one of 5,300 students at Gainesville State College, an hour north of Atlanta, Georgia. A 4-year-old ban prohibits anyone from using tobacco products on campus, including students, faculty and visitors. A smoke-free campus was the brainchild of longtime college president Martha Nesbitt, herself a former smoker. ""It's just a healthier place to be,"" says Nesbitt, ""because as you go in a building, you're not going to have to go through smoke. When you walk out, you don't see cigarette butts littered around. It's just a cleaner, healthier campus."" Nesbitt reports there haven't been any problems enforcing the ban. Signs are posted around campus, and the policy is prominently displayed on everything from the school Web site to admissions applications. The American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation reports nearly 60 college campuses around the United States have smoke-free policies that affect the entire campus. Other schools have limited restrictions, banning smoking indoors in residential housing and student facilities. Nesbitt believes her college is one of the first to fully prohibit the use of tobacco products. Watch more on efforts to curb smoking on campus » . The American Cancer Society says the movement is catching on. ""The trend toward a smoke-free country is going on everywhere,"" says Daniel Smith, president of the American Cancer Society Action Network. ""I think college campuses are simply reflecting the same trend we're seeing in society."" With the 30th anniversary this week of the nationwide Great American Smokeout, the cancer society is pushing a smoke-free college campus initiative. It encourages campus coordinators to hold competitions and distribute survival kits that include gum and support information. The group is trying to convince students that if they can quit for a day, they can quit for good. According to the cancer society, the prevalence of smoking in the United States is highest among college-age students, ages 18 to 24. While other age groups are decreasing their tobacco use, the cancer society says college students are smoking at a greater rate. Those statistics worry Smith. ""We know that 30 percent of all cancers are caused by smoking,"" he says. He blames the addiction rates among young adults on heavy marketing efforts on college campuses by tobacco companies. ""Many people might initially think it's cool. But when they're educated about the health effects, by that time, they are addicted, and it's very hard to quit."" Overton isn't all that worried about cutting back on his pack-a-day smoking habit, but he says that long walk to his car has provided some added benefits. ""It doesn't encourage me to quit, but it does encourage me to cut back some."" That's welcome news for some of his nonsmoking classmates. ""I'm not forced to be around all of the smokers,"" says freshman Matthew Bradford, 19. ""I'm not breathing it in all of the time, and it's nice to get some fresh air when you get out of class.""

Then, solar light arrived and changed everything. Children in Gudda stand on rooftops near a solar panel. Solar power first arrived two years ago. ""When the lanterns first arrived, the villagers asked, 'What is this?' "" says Hanuman Ram, the local solar engineer. ""I explained to them how it worked. Then slowly, as people saw it, they said, 'Wow, what a thing this is!'

Ram, the man credited with the transformation, doesn't have a high school degree. But he did attend an institution about an hour away called Barefoot College, established 35 years ago with an emphasis on helping India's rural population find solutions for their problems among themselves. The college, in part funded by the Indian government, trains villagers all over India who have little or no education, giving them a range of skills to change their lives. The entire campus, which has amenities such as a library, meeting halls, open-air theater and labs, uses solar power. On a recent visit to the main college campus, a group of village women were hard at work making solar cookers, which can boil a liter of water in eight minutes. They are part of the ""Women Barefoot Solar Cooker Engineers Society"" -- six women who came together and started their own business. Barefoot College serves an outlying community of 125,000 people. In a nearby village, women flock to a water desalinization and purification plant set up by the college and maintained by Barefoot graduates. The station, powered by solar panels, provides the area with a rare commodity: clean drinking water. At the local store in Gudda, owner Ram Swarup puts his solar panels to maximum use. He says the solar lights have allowed him to increase his business by a third. The panels also have powered up the only DVD player and television in the village. Partly paralyzed by polio, Swarup never dreamed that he would have so much in life. He says it took courage -- and light. The villagers say that they now feel empowered -- less reliant on a far-off government. Even the village's engineer is amazed. At Ram's house, the solar lamps flicker to life. He smiles as he says that before, he didn't even know what artificial light was, and now, he's a solar power expert. ""I never saw light before,"" he says. ""How could I think that I could bring light here?"" Like most of the Barefoot graduates, he was selected to attend the college by his village elders. Now, every night when the lights flicker on, he says, he feels great. With the extra earnings he's made as a solar engineer, he's made another of his childhood dreams come true. He purchased his favorite instrument, a harmonium, and now the family can gather around every night and listen to his music. He says he hopes his daughter, now 14 years old, will follow in his footsteps and become a solar engineer.

97,"(CNN)  -- The American Civil Liberties Union is pushing for a quick legal decision, hoping to save a high school prom that was allegedly canceled because two lesbians wanted to attend it together. The rights group filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against a Mississippi school district and high school in federal court Tuesday over the April 2 prom. The case will be argued before a federal judge in Mississippi on March 22, the ACLU said. The showdown stems from a complaint by 18-year-old Constance McMillen, who said she was told not to bring her girlfriend to the prom or wear a tuxedo. The prom was canceled after the ACLU demanded that McMillen's high school change its policy. ""I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together,"" McMillen said in an ACLU news release. ""A lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else, which I really appreciate. But all I've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school's prom with my girlfriend."" The motion filed Tuesday is part of a lawsuit that the ACLU has filed against the Itawamba County School District and Itawamba Agricultural High School. At the center of the lawsuit is a memorandum from the school to students, dated February 5, which says that prom dates must be of the opposite sex. Also, when McMillen expressed a desire to wear a tuxedo to the prom, the district superintendent told her only male students were allowed to wear them, according to court documents. Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence, according to the documents. School district officials could not be reached for comment. But the county's board of education said in a statement last week that ""Due to the distractions to the educational process caused by recent events, the Itawamba County School District has decided to not host a prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School this year."" The ACLU aims to change that. ""We are determined to get the prom back on the calendar and open to all students,"" said ACLU lawyer Christine Sun. ""What this case comes down to is the school taking the extraordinary measure of canceling the prom, rather than live up to its legal obligation to fairly treat all students who want to come to it.""",0.54654837,9001

99,"Editor's Note: David Hawkins is Director of Public Policy and Research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling, a nonprofit organization that represents more than 11,000 high school counselors and college admission officers from across the country. He was the author of a report last month by the organization's commission on the use of standardized tests. David Hawkins says test scores shouldn't be used to rank college quality . ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- A recent controversy at Baylor University has brought new attention to the widespread misuse of standardized college admission tests to rank the quality of America's colleges and universities. The SAT and ACT have achieved nearly iconic status in America and throughout the world. As the late author and scholar Stephen Jay Gould noted, the tests are viewed by many as ""abstruse and mysterious,"" with powerful effects on public policy, social mobility, and even individual identity. Misuse of test scores as college ranking criteria creates undue pressure on admission offices to pursue increasingly high test scores and fuels the tests' disproportionate influence. Last June, Baylor University encouraged its already admitted first-year students to retake the SAT. The reward for students who retook the test was $300 in bookstore credits. Students who increased their score by more than 50 points got a $1,000 merit aid scholarship. If enough students retook the SAT and increased their scores, the gains might be enough to move Baylor up the rankings list. The scarce financial resources allocated for this plan are too badly needed elsewhere, particularly among low-income students in rural and urban areas around the country, to spend on an effort to raise a college's SAT profile. A Baylor spokesman told The Associated Press Thursday that the university ""goofed"" and would likely end the incentives. It's critical to understand that high SAT and ACT scores alone do not equate to merit. Last month, our organization's Commission on the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission issued a report calling for change in the way everyone involved in college admissions uses the tests. Test misuses feed the public perception that the scores are the most influential factor in college admission. For the past 15 years, National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) research has shown that students' grades in high school, particularly grades in college preparatory courses, are by far the most important consideration in college admission decisions. One of the most pressing problems regarding the SAT and ACT scores is their misuse in the U.S. News and World Report college rankings formula. The SAT and ACT were designed to provide information about a student to colleges and universities and were never meant to be measures of college quality. Accordingly, the commission encouraged U.S. News and World Report to eliminate test scores as a measure of institutional quality. The U.S. News ranking formula includes a ""student selectivity"" score that constitutes 15 percent of a college's overall rank. SAT or ACT scores of enrollees make up 50 percent of the student selectivity score. In response to the NACAC report, U.S. News and World Report said, ""As long as standardized tests play an integral role in the college admissions process, U.S. News will use them as part of our ranking methodology."" The situation at Baylor is a reminder of the inflated value assigned to the SAT and ACT in higher education. The fervor surrounding the rankings, as well as the lengths to which colleges go to increase them, are unfortunate distractions in higher education and admissions. The impression students and families get from the rankings is that higher test scores mean higher quality colleges. To borrow a phrase familiar to admission deans, many colleges recruit great students and then graduate great students. Is that because of the institution, or the students? Some credit undoubtedly should go to both. But is a college of lower quality because its students' SAT scores are lower than those of students at another college? Generally speaking, the ability of admission tests to predict success in higher education is much more limited than most people think. Colleges most often determine the utility of admission test scores by assessing how well they predict first-year grades. Colleges are wrong to place so much emphasis on test scores as measurements of their institutional worth when admission offices across the board consider the scores to be one among many indicators of a student's merit. As influential as the rankings have been with students and families, is it any wonder that colleges whose stakeholders often demand higher ranks go to such lengths to influence their position in the rankings? Misuse of test scores has real ramifications for students and families. For every student able to afford test-performance tutoring and fees for taking the test many times, there are many qualified students from under-served backgrounds who become discouraged that they will be unable to compete. For every college that raises its SAT or ACT profile for rankings purposes, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of qualified students who will never apply because artificially inflated test scores signal yet another barrier to higher education. It is critical to re-evaluate the varied uses of admission tests, and protect against their misuse in all forms.

101,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- White students at a South African university tricked black residence hall workers into eating stew containing urine, prompting a march Wednesday in which five people were arrested, university officials said. Students protest against a racist video on the campus of Free State University in Bloemfontein, South Africa. The white students made a video of the incident, which they staged in reaction to the university's efforts to integrate its residences, according to a statement from the University of the Free State. The protesters on Wednesday included black and white students who later marched to the residence where the video was made and demanded that it be shut down, witnesses said. The video surfaced on Tuesday but was made in September, the university said. In the video, white male students at Reitz Residence are seen encouraging at least three black female housekeepers to participate in what the students call the ""Reitz Fear Factor,"" an apparent reference to the television show in which contestants eat live worms or compete in other feats.  Watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage » . In one scene from the video, a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items. Then he tells the camera he will add the ""special ingredient."" The student then urinates into the mixture, which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave. Other students can be heard laughing on the tape. The next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew, saying, ""This is our dorm's 'Fear Factor.' We want to see who has the best 'Fear Factor.'"" On the video, the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture. The women, on their knees, spit the stew into buckets after tasting it. Some appeared to vomit, but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on. Next, the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race. The video is put in slow-motion as the theme from ""Chariots of Fire"" plays. Finally, one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women, telling her she has won the ""Fear Factor."" At the end of the video, a message appears on the screen in Afrikaans saying, ""That, at the end of the day, is what we think of integration."" University officials and human rights groups in South Africa denounced the video. ""The executive management of the [university] condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved,"" said UFS Rector Frederick Fourie in a statement posted on the university's Web site. ""We have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter,"" he added. Later Wednesday, Fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them, a statement from the university said. Counseling is being provided for the workers, it added. The students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended, Fourie said, and charges against the men will be filed with the South African Police Service. Two of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in Bloemfontein, according to the university. Two others completed their studies last year. The students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced. ""I am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video. I have publicly said several times that the UFS is not a place for racism,"" the rector's statement said. ""The fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in UFS residences is also most disturbing,"" Fourie said. A spokeswoman in Free State province for the Democratic Alliance -- an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all South Africans at the center of its policies -- called the video ""shocking and inhumane."" ""It looked like they were willing [participants] but they didn't know what purpose the video served. ... It was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat,"" said spokeswoman Liana Van Wyk, the South African Press Association reported. Helen Zille, the Democratic Alliance's leader, Wednesday asked the South African Human Rights Commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university. ""The abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims' constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected,"" Zille said in a statement posted on the group's Web site. ""This incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel [residence] integration,"" she said. Fourie acknowledged in his statement that ""the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity, respect, human dignity and human rights."" He added, ""These kinds of actions make it all the more important that we succeed with establishing such a new institutional culture on the campus. I appeal to all staff and students to remain calm and to act in the best interests of the university."" The university, a research center, is one of South Africa's oldest; founded in 1904. It has more than 25,000 students, according to its Web site, and uses a parallel-medium instruction in English and Afrikaans for its full range of undergraduate and graduate programs.

102,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jewish students and faculty at California universities fear for their safety on campus because of threats aimed at them over the Middle East conflict, the father of a slain Wall Street Journal reporter said Friday. Judea Pearl, the father of slain reporter Daniel Pearl, says anti-Semitism is on rise on college campuses. Judea Pearl, whose son, Daniel Pearl, was kidnapped and killed by al Qaeda extremists while on assignment in Pakistan in 2002, told reporters at a news conference that anti-Semitic e-mail and verbal threats have escalated since Israel's three-week invasion of Gaza in January. Pearl teaches computer science on UCLA's Westwood campus. On the school's Web site, UCLA Chancellor Gene Block issued a statement about the university's policy. ""The conflict in the Middle East and current events in Gaza are some of the most highly controversial issues of our time, stirring deep emotions on all sides,"" the statement read. ""We have a responsibility to protect the freedom of expression. We also all have a responsibility to listen and engage -- respectfully -- even as we must understand that not every campus forum on a controversial topic will satisfy passionate and concerned members of the campus and broader communities,"" said Block. Pearl and officials at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, where the news conference was held, are concerned that administrators on college campuses across the country are not doing enough to foster freedom of expression while protecting Jewish students and faculty members from acts of intimidation on campuses. ""The verbal abuse is there, the intimidation is there, the feeling of helplessness is there, not only among students but among faculty,"" said Pearl. Pearl cited an incident several years ago in which he was threatened. ""I received hate messages from someone at UCLA who did not identify himself and said, 'I saw you in Ackerman Union and I know where your office is and I'm going to beat the (expletive) out of you,'"" Pearl said. ""I handed it to the campus police, and they did not do anything."" UCLA spokeswoman Elizabeth Boatright-Simon told CNN there is no record of Pearl's complaint to campus police but said the university plans to meet with him. Wiesenthal Center officials cited another incident three weeks ago at San Jose State University where the consul general of Israel was verbally abused and forcibly driven from the stage during a guest-speaking engagement aimed at fostering understanding of Jewish culture. The diplomat, Akiva Tor, had to be escorted out of the room by security officers and campus police before the event ended, according to Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Wiesenthal Center and Michelle Salinsky, president of Spartans for Israel, the group which co-sponsored the speaking event. ""We were extremely concerned about our safety and Mr. Tor's safety,"" said Salinsky, a senior majoring in political science. ""Mr. Tor said he's never felt more disrespected. This was clearly an infringement of our expression of free speech. I think a lot of Jewish students do not feel safe on campuses because of the escalation of hate perpetrated against Jews."" San Jose State University spokeswoman Pat Harris told CNN the sponsors of the event were responsible for moderating the speaking forum but maintained that officers and security personnel acted appropriately. In a statement, the university president Jon Whitmore defended the university's policies but expressed concern about the event. ""Our campus places high value on the free exchange of ideas in a manner that is inclusive and respectful of differing views,"" the statement read. ""At a recent campus event, numerous members of the audience with views differing from the invited speaker were so vocal in their expression of opposition and so uncooperative with the moderator's requests for orderly means of handling questions and answers that they disrupted the event and did not allow the speaker to respond to posed questions. The university fully endorses the free expression of ideas and opinion, but does not condone behavior and methods of expression that disrupt free and orderly discussion."" As part of an effort to promote tolerance, the Wiesenthal Center announced plans to unveil a public service campaign next month which will be distributed online at Columbia University, UCLA, UC-Berkeley, San Jose State University and the University of Chicago, among other campuses. ""There are a lot of Jewish kids in California and elsewhere who are beginning to look elsewhere and saying maybe the UC system is not a user friendly place to go and we can't accept that,"" said Cooper.",0.536861,2593
103,"(CNN) -- For Brad Cohen, the barking and squealing noises he could not control began in the fifth grade. Fifty kids came to Camp Twitch and Shout's first session. Director Brad Cohen says he hopes to double that figure. ""I remember eating lunch at school all by myself and the mean kids would parade around me and mock my noises. My teacher made me get up in front of the class and apologize to everybody for the noises I was making,"" Cohen recalls. More than 20 years later, Cohen is a camp director, celebrating the first year of Camp Twitch and Shout, a place for youngsters, who like Cohen, have Tourette syndrome. ""Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder which causes people to make noises and tics that they can't control,"" Cohen says. Fifty campers, between the ages of 7 and 18, came from all over the country to spend a week in Winder, Georgia, about 45 miles east of Atlanta. They have plenty to do, from swimming and fishing to music and arts and crafts. Most have been teased or harassed in school, and the camp is a place just to have fun. ""It's very nice to be able to let it all out and just not have to worry and not have people stare at you and think that you're weird and think -- what's wrong with that person?"" says 16-year-old camper and black belt Tinsley Birchfield of Atlanta.  Watch more from Camp Twist and Shout » . For other campers, such as Jacob McGee of Savannah, Georgia, just being outdoors is magical. ""My favorite part was when we climbed the tree. That was pretty awesome. I went as high as I could go. It was really fun,"" says the 11-year-old. According to experts, Twitch and Shout is one of only five weeklong camps in the country for children with Tourette syndrome. Atlanta-based child neurologist Howard Schub says such camps help children better cope with their condition. Some campers have never met another kid with Tourette syndrome. ""A child goes to camp, they see that they're not the worst. ... There are others that are functioning pretty well with worse tics than they,"" Schub says. Cohen adds, ""They see that wow, 'There are other kids that are like me.' They laugh, they tell the same jokes, they have the same interests. And what we hope is that their self-esteem goes up."" Twitch and Shout campers display motor tics common to most kids with Tourette syndrome such as eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, head jerking, and -- in a few rare cases -- cursing. Camp activities are filled with the sounds of typical vocal tics: sniffing, throat clearing, hooting, barking, hissing and squealing. But campers such as teenager Kevin Kardon of Athens, Georgia, say they've just gotten used to it. ""It's just kind of like you're listening to music, and you hear something in the background and you don't really hear it,"" Kevin says. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three out of every 1,000 school-age children are believed to have Tourette syndrome. The cause is unknown, but genetics appear to play a role. Most children develop the condition between 7 and 10, and if their tics are mild to moderate, they usually require no medicine to control them. Symptoms usually peak during the late teens or early 20s. ""Many children, as they get older, the tics become either much less prominent or certainly reduced to a single or just a few tics that are not as disabling,"" Schub says. That was certainly the case with Cohen. Barking is still his dominant tic, but when he was the age of his campers, he wrestled to control several others, including eye blinking, teeth chomping and arm twitching. In middle school, when his tics were at the height of their intensity, the principal approached him and asked if he'd like to educate the student body about his condition. Cohen says this move changed his life. ""They gave me a standing ovation, and it was on that day that I realized the power of education. I wanted to be that teacher that I never had. And that was my dream. I wanted to be the teacher that focused on kids' strengths, not weaknesses,"" he says. And that's what he's been trying to do in the classroom for more than 13 years. At 35, Cohen is an elementary school teacher, the author of a book on Tourette syndrome and now a camp director. He says he hopes his campers find strength in knowing they are not alone and will carry this new confidence home with them to face the challenges of the upcoming school year. ""When they have tough times and they think they can't find success, it's our goal that they will think back to their experience at Camp Twitch and Shout and say, 'You know what? I can do it; I can be successful because I did it at camp,' "" Cohen says. Next summer, Cohen says he plans to recruit twice as many campers and hopes the experience will be as worthwhile for them as it was this year for 15-year-old Chris Wall of Athens. ""This camp was awesome because it had people just like me,"" says Chris, beaming.",0.5359541,5353
104,"SMYRNA, Georgia (CNN) -- A week before the start of the new school year, principal Denise Magee roamed the hallways of Campbell Middle School in Smyrna, Georgia, preparing for battle. Middle-school principal Denise Magee says a best-case scenario would be a school year without bullying. The adversary? Preteen and teenage bullies. Toting anti-bullying posters and masking tape, Magee was determined to let students see from Day One that she had a zero-tolerance policy when it came to that kind of harassment. ""Middle-school kids are just cruel to each other,"" Magee said. ""They speak their minds, so you see bullying in the form of teasing, taunting, social isolation and name calling."" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 30 percent of all children in grades six through 10 have been bullied or have bullied other children during a school year. Clinical psychologist Mark Crawford of Roswell, Georgia, called the statistics unacceptable. ""Bullying is not a rite of passage,"" he said. ""It always has a bad outcome."" Crawford said several times a month he hears complaints from young patients who are victims of bullies. And he worried about the consequences. ""Kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms, physical complaints, emotional problems and academic underachievement."" Parenting expert Stacey DeBroff, author of ""The Mom Book,"" cautioned that bullying often occurs in places that aren't monitored by adults, such as a walking route to and from school, a corner of a playground and the Internet. She warned mothers and fathers to be on the lookout for signs a child is being bullied. ""When you see signs of being anxious, sad and withdrawn, of having a kid move off their typical personality, it alerts you that something is going on."" Crawford noted that some of those symptoms can be attributed to typical adolescent behavior, but he added, ""When you see a real change in a child's personality or their normal routine, it's a bad sign.""  Health Minute: Watch more on defeating bullies » . He also conceded that some children won't open up to their parents about bullying. ""One of the reasons kids don't tell their parents they are being bullied is the fear that their parents will run in and do something about it and they think that will make it worse."" DeBroff agreed that it is tempting for some parents to rush in to solve the problem by calling the bully's parents. ""You often know them, your kids have been in school together, you feel like calling them up...so they're on the defensive and really it's never a point of resolution."" Crawford said that it's important to do your homework before attempting to resolve the situation. He encouraged parents to talk with their child first and get them to open up about what's happening. ""You need to find out when it is happening, where it is happening and exactly what is going on,"" he said. When elementary age children are involved, Crawford recommended parents intervene more quickly. ""Younger kids have a limited arsenal from which to draw,"" he said. ""They don't necessarily know how to be more assertive."" Middle-school students may want to have some control over the situation, according to Crawford. In that case, he said it might be a good idea to go over possible scenarios and options that will help them put a stop to the bullying. DeBroff said it is important to ask for help from a teacher or school administrator. ""They want to know about it because it ripples into the classrooms and places that aren't visible to them."" Magee, the middle-school principal, agreed. ""I do not want parents to leave us out of the scenario,"" she said. ""I want them to immediately contact us."" But be judicious, she urged. Some parents can inflame the situation. ""You will encounter situations where parents will tell their kids, 'If you are hit, I want you to hit back.' "" Experts point out it is important for parents to keep emotions in check and to not encourage a child to hit back or retaliate. Instead, DeBroff suggested parents become strategic advisers to their child and help them avoid bullying situations. In a couple of weeks, after her students get settled, Magee plans to hold grade-level meetings about her school's anti-bullying policy. In the meantime, she remained optimistic and hoped this school year will be different. ""The best-case scenario as local school principal? We are bullyproof, fully free of any bully incidents, that we are truly here with academic focus, no fighting, no teasing, no name calling, none of that. We're here to learn.""",0.53334343,7834
105,"(CNN) -- Anjali Thakur is living in fear in India. She is a mother afraid for her son. ""We are all having sleepless nights,"" Thakur says. Sourabh Sharma -- one of the Indian students attacked in Melbourne. Her son isn't in a war zone or even a country known to be dangerous. He is a student in Melbourne, Australia. ""Three years back when we sent him,"" she says, ""it was one of the safest places for the children to go."" The Australian government says it is still safe but a spate of vicious attacks on Indian students in recent weeks has parents like Thakur and hundreds of students shaken and angry. From Melbourne to Victoria to Sydney Indian students say they are targets of racially motivated attacks. At least 10 Indian students have been attacked over the past month, the most severe case left an Indian student in a coma, another student was stabbed in the stomach, and a third left with a nasty black eye. So far more than a dozen arrests have been made. Australia authorities say they don't believe the attacks and robberies are racially motivated but instead crimes of opportunity against soft targets: students who typically travel alone at night on public transportation. But hundreds of Indian students see it differently. They have reacted with protests in at least three Australian cities. Police say at one point Indian students decided to take the law into their own hands and retaliate which has been condemned in both India and Australia. The situation has gotten so much attention Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has made several statements on the matter, insisting the attacks are isolated incidents. In an interview on Australian radio he said: ""Every city has violence, let's put this into perspective, and Australia I'm advised on the statistics is one of the safest countries in the world for international students."" In India though the perception of a safe Australia has been shattered partly due to the widespread publicity of the recent cases. The story has been front page news for days while local television media has been going with breaking news every time it receives a report of an Indian student attacked anywhere in Australia. Political tension has even bubbled up between India and Australia with India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressing the attacks and asking Australia does something to safeguard India's young people. Australia has responded with a 10-point action plan to help safeguard students. A helpline has also been set up. As for Anjali Thakur, she says her son has lived in Australia for three years and never experienced violence; in fact she says he didn't even know about the attacks in Melbourne where he lives until she called him to warn him. But Thakur has been watching the news in India and seeing a totally different picture of Australia. ""It's a lovely beautiful peaceful country,"" Thakur says, ""but now what you see on TV and what you hear, that's a total contrast to what we know of Australia."" The Thakur family has responded by refusing to let the youngest son study in Australia and keeping their eldest son from enrolling in a master's program at his university. If that kind of sentiment spreads, it could have serious consequences for Australia's $12.6 billion-a-year education export industry. More than 80,000 students from India study in Australia. ""Any parent will tell you,"" Thakur says, ""they are not going to send a child for the best education in the world at the cost of his life.""",0.52031267,8298
106,"Editor's note: Dina Habib Powell, global head of corporate engagement at Goldman Sachs, served as U.S. assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs from 2005 to 2007. Dina Habib Powell says there are encouraging signs the world is ready to invest in empowering women. NEW YORK (CNN) -- As we mark International Women's Month in March, it is encouraging to see that the movement to recognize the vital role that women play in families, nations and economies has been building for more than a decade and that developments in the past few years have shown that real progress has begun to take hold. On the heels of International Women's Day, President Obama said Monday, ""we will not sow the seeds for a brighter future or reap the benefits of the change we need without the full and active participation of women around the world."" He also recently announced the creation of a new position, ambassador-at-large for global women's Issues, at the State Department. To fill this critical role, the president nominated Melanne Verveer, a widely respected women's advocate and former top aide to then first lady Hillary Clinton. Verveer was a founder of Vital Voices Global Partnership, an organization committed to empowering women and recently co-chaired by Secretary Clinton and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. There has also been very recent progress on Capitol Hill. Last month, the U.S. Senate created a Foreign Relations subcommittee that will focus on the global status of women, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. The efforts have been a bipartisan priority for our leaders. In 2008, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice successfully led the effort in the U.N. Security Council to officially recognize rape as a weapon of war. And in 2001, Laura Bush used the first presidential radio address ever given by a first lady to focus international attention on the plight of women in Afghanistan and used her influence to protect and empower women around the world. Critical strides are also being made globally. In Rwanda, a country devastated by genocide, women have become a key part of the nation's rebirth. Under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, more than half of the parliament is made up of women. In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf made history when she became the first female president on the African continent. In the Middle East, Kuwait has emerged as a leader in women's suffrage and political participation. And in the United Arab Emirates, women such as Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, minister of foreign trade, have been trailblazers for progress throughout the region. This social change is being promoted at the United Nations, where Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently noted that the protection, education and empowerment of women and girls are among the most important ingredients to achieving all other Millennium Development Goals. Such consensus should not be surprising as study after study has found that investing in the education of women improves lives. Every extra year of girls' education can reduce infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent. In Africa, children of mothers who receive five years of primary education are 40 percent more likely to live beyond age 5. And multicountry data show educated mothers are about 50 percent more likely to immunize their children than uneducated mothers are. But one of the most important developments of recent years has been the increasing amount of research that shows investments in women can offer not only social benefits, but also real economic growth. A growing body of evidence highlights the economic advantage of educating and empowering women. The private sector has seized on this data. There is now broad consensus that investing in women is not only just good social policy, it is ""smart economics,"" as Bob Zoellick, president of the World Bank, says. Toward that end, the World Bank has convened a Private Sector Leaders Forum with companies committed to these issues, such as Standard Chartered, Cisco, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Carlson and Nike. My own firm, Goldman Sachs, published two critical pieces of research, ""Womenomics"" and ""Women Hold Up Half the Sky,"" which found that investments in women -- through increased education and labor force participation -- can lead to real economic growth in developed and developing countries. Specifically, this research found that a 1 percentage point increase in female education raises the average level of gross domestic product by .37 and raises annual GDP growth rates by .2 on average. Such findings led to the development of 10,000 Women, an initiative that is working with a global network of leading academic and nonprofit partners to provide women at home and abroad with quality management and entrepreneurial education. This education is helping to create a greater number of female-owned small and medium enterprises, and a new generation of leaders poised to have exponential impact. One recent graduate of the program, Tuokpe Esisi, a fashion designer from Nigeria, has already increased her revenues, and immediately invested a portion of her profits to provide tutors for the illiterate male tailors she employs. This not only positions her enterprise for greater growth, but is also a perfect demonstration of the multiplier effect of investing in women. Organizations such as Women for Women International, Camfed and the International Center for Research on Women have long touted this multiplier effect and are supported by private-public partnerships dedicated to the promotion of women leaders. For example, the State Department, with the help of Vital Voices, instituted a mentoring program for the past four years with Fortune's Most Powerful Women. The program pairs leading U.S. executives -- such as Ann Moore (Time Inc), Pat Woertz (ADM), Helene Gayle (Care) and Anne Mulcahy (Xerox) -- with rising female entrepreneurs in developing countries. At the dawn of the 20th century, Egyptian poet Hafez Ibrahim said: ""When you educate a woman, you create a nation."" Nearly a century later, the cause of women's empowerment has never been more important. As New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof recently put it, gender inequality is ""the dominant moral challenge we face in the 21st century."" This challenge also presents an opportunity we cannot afford to squander. We should seize this moment and this momentum. There is tremendous work to be done, but history has shown us that women will not let us down. They will take up the challenge and build up their families, their villages and ultimately all our nations.

(UWIRE) -- A Web site developed this year that allows students to share old exams online is causing debate among professors about its ethical implications. PostYourTest.com creator Demir Oral says the site is a tool for education, not for cheating. PostYourTest.com is an educational tool that lets students anonymously upload materials and tests from their previous and current classes, said Demir Oral, creator of the site. However, there are teachers who do not want their tests to be posted for every student to see. ""I would not be happy if a student who had taken a class of mine had taken an exam and posted it online,"" Sarah Hall, graduate professor of psychology at Penn State University, said. ""I know that some teachers reuse past exams and it would be hard to have to write a new test for every class."" However, Mary Bojan, professor of chemistry at PSU, said she wouldn't mind if students posted her tests online. ""For my classes I always write new exams every time, and I wouldn't object because I have some old exams up online that I've posted myself,"" Bojan said. Currently, there are no tests online for Penn State University, because the site was developed on the West Coast, Oral said. ""Primarily the main audience is San Diego, but that's because I've only advertised around there,"" Oral said. He said he is looking into expanding the site more to include universities and colleges across the country. ""Also, although I am still focused on the United States, in the future I would like to go global,"" Oral said. ""I think it would be really effective worldwide."" While studying for an exam in the HUB-Robeson Center, Christal Cozier (senior-nutrition) said she would consider using the site. ""I think looking at an old exam helps -- it at least gives the student an idea of how the teacher poses questions,"" Cozier said. While she said she wouldn't go through the trouble of posting a test herself, Cozier said she didn't think students posting old tests online would be a problem. ""Most teachers give out practice exams and old exams anyway,"" she said. ""The only time I would think it would be a problem is if the teacher uses exams more than once."" In response to criticism of the site from professors, Oral said he wants people to know the site is a tool for education and not a tool for cheating. He added teachers can ban their exams from the site if they don't want students sharing them online. ""The first professor that banned his exams said he wanted to ban them because he was copyrighting them and publishing them in a book, and that made total sense to me,"" Oral said. Even with the option to ban tests, Tara Chismar said professors may not know the site exists and may not know to ban their exams from it. She said the site might be OK only if students get permission from their teachers to post exams online. Bojan said the biggest problem she saw with students posting material online would be putting up tests the teachers wanted handed back in. ""Common sense needs to come into play with something like this because there's a student responsibility side to it,"" she said. ""Having access to an exam you're not supposed to is cheating."" Students shouldn't have to rely on old tests online to prepare for an exam from a new teacher, Hall said. ""There are likely a lot of professors who would be happy to give students more of a sense of what the exam is going to be like -- maybe giving them sample questions,"" she said. Bojan warned students should use materials posted online wisely because looking at an exam may not always be the best way to study. ""One problem is old tests may not be the most effective study tool,"" she said. ""By just going off of old exams students aren't learning how to actually do the problems.""",0.5036504,8786

Pittsburgh may seem like an unlikely choice for such a high-profile event, but a closer look shows why this city personifies the transformative power of education and research, and how the practical application of innovation can drive growth and improvement in quality of life the world over. Pittsburgh is a city that was largely written off as a rusted industrial center. But as heads of state from around the world tour the city this week, they will see running trails replacing former industrial railways and they will find green hotels and LEED-certified buildings rising where abandoned steel mills once stood. These changes are creating jobs, bringing new commerce and making Pittsburgh the most livable city in the United States, according to the Economist magazine. President Obama has praised our city as a ""bold example"" of the new green economy. A significant part of Pittsburgh's renaissance can be attributed to its two major research universities: Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. Having one such institution is an advantage in today's global economy; having two (very close to each other) puts Pittsburgh in a very small group of American cities. The shape of today's research university, with its heavy dependence on federally sponsored research, can be traced to World War II and its immediate aftermath, with a major boost a decade later when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. But what began as a response to national security threats has turned into the engine of America's -- and the world's -- prosperity. As my colleague, the Dean of Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering, Pradeep Khosla has written, the industries that have fueled economic growth have come out of the American research university enterprise. Biotechnology, nanotechnology, digital communications, and computers and software that have improved our quality of life and economic standing all have their origins in research universities. The companies that apply this research create jobs and fuel economic growth and wealth generation in ways that the world has never before experienced. According to one report prepared for the White House, 50 percent of the growth in the American economy in the last 40 years has been due to investments in research and development. Obviously, the private sector is a major driver of R&D, but federally funded research at universities throughout the United States plays a key role. The presence of a major research university does not, by itself, guarantee economic progress beyond the direct jobs that the university creates. Realizing the full potential of a university depends on effectively tapping into the brilliance and ingenuity of its faculty and students and the innovations they create. Technology commercialization -- shaping a bright idea into a commercially successful product -- has been described as a ""contact sport"". It requires an innovative and entrepreneurial campus culture and an ecosystem surrounding it that supports technology-based economic development with facilities, money and people who know how to take ideas to the market. More than a decade ago, Carnegie Mellon embraced Pittsburgh's economic development as one of its institutional strategic priorities. We changed our technology transfer policies to make it easier and faster for our faculty and alumni to create local companies based on our technology. We joined forces with the University of Pittsburgh and partnered with state and local government and industry to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem on which we all rely. Today, there are more than 200 Pittsburgh companies commercializing Carnegie Mellon technology. Our economic development efforts have also included company attraction. With state and local government support, we built a building on campus for global technology companies, which see value in being so close to our faculty and students. There are now hundreds of new jobs in that building, created by Intel, Google and Apple. Disney set up their first research lab here, but they're across the street -- the new building is full. The success of the American research university has been, and continues to be, studied by many developing and developed countries that want to advance technology, secure a stronger position for themselves in global markets and raise the standard of living for their citizens. It is clear that the U.S. model must be replicated in many countries in order for the world to be a better place. During the last decade, in pursuit of another of our strategic priorities, Carnegie Mellon has partnered with several countries, including Qatar, Portugal, Greece, Australia and Japan, among others, to establish high-caliber education and research programs. Countries that can successfully replicate the U.S. research university enterprise will secure for themselves a strong position for the future, for they will be the source of the next wave of economic expansion in the world. We are living in one of the most intellectually exciting eras in history. From medicine to energy, to robotics and computing, many fields of science are experiencing a revolution that will change our understanding of what is possible. These revolutions are occurring on the campuses and laboratories of research universities every day around the world. As world leaders arrive here in Pittsburgh, they must keep in mind the importance of research and education, historically and in addressing today's most challenging issues. As they contemplate stimulus plans and regulation of the financial industry, and enjoy Pittsburgh's beauty and impressive progress, they must also resolve to sustain and, in most countries, grow their systems of higher education, including and especially their research universities. Research universities are at the heart of Pittsburgh's transformation, and they are a key to our collective future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jared L.

111,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Do you need to borrow to fund a college education for yourself or your child? Be sure you're taking my ""Clark Smart"" approach to borrowing. Clark Howard: If a four-year college is too cost prohibitive, try a two-year institution at a fraction of the cost . Subsidized Stafford loans are the single best source of money you can borrow. The interest is picked up by the federal government -- courtesy of your fellow taxpayers -- while you're in school and for a six-month grace period following graduation. Once the loans go into repayment, subsidized Stafford loans taken out during the 2009-10 school year carry a fixed interest rate of 5.6 percent. The rate will be lower still at 4.5 percent for loans originating during the next school year, and all the way down to 3.4 percent the following year. There are, however, limits to the amount you can borrow. Freshman can get up to $3,500 annually; sophomores can borrow $4,500 each year; and juniors and seniors cap out at $5,500. Once you exhaust your subsidized Stafford stockpile, you want to move on to unsubsidized Stafford loans, which are now offered at 6.8 percent. Remember, though, to borrow as little as possible because the interest on these unsubsidized loans accumulates while you're in school.  Watch smart choices when paying back the loans » . As a third option, parents can take out PLUS loans, which are issued at a fixed rate of 8.25 percent. Visit FAFSA.ed.gov to determine your eligibility for all these loan options. What's one type of loan you do not want to take out? Private student loans. Back in 2005, the private student loan industry used its political influence to gain the right to use any and all tactics (short of threatening bodily harm or actually causing it) in their efforts to collect money. In fact, private student loans typically can't even be dismissed in bankruptcy. Remember my rule of thumb when it comes to determining what level of borrowing you can comfortably handle: Do not take on a total loan amount that exceeds the likely first-year earnings in your field. If college is still too cost-prohibitive after you've gotten all the financial aid and loans you can, I'd love for you to think about starting your degree at a two-year community college. The cost of a community college can be as little as one-tenth to one-twentieth that of a private college, as I discovered when I researched schools with my eldest daughter. Let's say you decide to do your first two years at a community college. People often worry about the lack of prestige associated with these kinds of schools. But most employers only look at the name of the traditional college that issues your degree after you've put in your time at a community school. In fact, an employer might even prefer someone who worked their way through a community college and had to struggle financially. Doesn't that show more fortitude in a job candidate than the person who cruised through a 4-year college on the silver-spoon plan? And for those of you already dealing with paying off student loan debt, there's a radical change coming that I want you to know about. Effective July 1, an income-based repayment plan (IBR) became available to borrowers with Stafford loans and Grad PLUS loans. Under the new program, your payment will be based on your current income and family size. That means your monthly payment could be an unprecedented zero dollars if you qualify! Contact your lender to see if you qualify and to apply for the IBR. In addition to the IBR, other new provisions that went into effect July 1 include loan forgiveness options for certain workers. Nonprofit workers and some government employees are eligible for loan forgiveness after making on-time monthly payments for 10 years. If you work in the traditional for-profit sector, it will take 25 years of on-time payments before you're eligible for loan forgiveness.

112,"(CNN Student News)  -- Discussion Questions . 1. When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month? 2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history? 3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers? Learning Activities . Use these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans. 1. A Milestone in U.S. History . Remind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school's historian or media specialist for archiving. 2. Covering Black History . Ask students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time. 3. Harlem Renaissance . Inform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement. Have each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as ""roaming curators"" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans. 4. Profiles in Black History . Do your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom. 5. Local African-American History . Valuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history. 6. Black History Museum . Celebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits? 7. Not Just for February . Inform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.
