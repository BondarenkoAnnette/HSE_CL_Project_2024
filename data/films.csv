0,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- When Max Records auditioned for the ""Where the Wild Things Are"" (out Friday) role of Max, the precocious boy in a dirty white wolf suit who sails to an island full of fearsome horned monsters and becomes their even more fearsome king, he arrived with one advantage -- and it wasn't his first name. Max Records plays Max in the film adaptation of the children's book ""Where the Wild Things Are."" ""I had memorized all the lines,"" the now-12-year-old acting novice from Portland, Oregon, told EW earlier this year. ""I was totally obsessed with the book, like from the age of half a year old to, like, 4. So I was really familiar with it."" (Ah, the perspective of youth.) Of course, Maurice Sendak's 1963 kid-lit masterpiece is a picture book containing just 10 sentences. But Records clearly has a deep feel for the material. ""It's not moralistic or patronizing. It's not 'Johnny did something bad and had to apologize.' It's about being a kid. It's just real."" Spike Jonze, the auteur behind ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich,"" told EW he initially balked when offered the project more than a decade ago -- by no less than Sendak himself. ""I felt it was just so perfect in the form in which it already existed,"" said Jonze. ""I didn't know what more you'd add to flesh it into a movie, or even why you would want to add to it."" He's reluctant to share too many details, but says his live-action adaptation elaborates on the world of the wild things as well as Max's relationship with his mom (Catherine Keener) and her boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo). Jonze began shooting in 2006, but by 2008 the movie was not yet finished and there were reports that Warner Bros. wanted the whole thing reshot. Not true, says Jonze and producer Vincent Landay, though both admit the production was a long, challenging process -- from finding a naturalistic way to depict the fantasy world (""I wanted everything to feel like it had really happened, not fabricated with CGI,"" says Jonze) to filming in the remote wilderness of Australia to getting emotionally resonant performances from Records, the puppet monsters, and the voice cast (including James Gandolfini and Forest Whitaker). Laughs Jonze, ""We made it really, really hard on ourselves."" Here are more EW Picks for the week of October 11: . Movies . ""The Stepfather"" (out Friday). The original 1987 ""Stepfather"" -- about a seemingly kind man who marries a vulnerable widow and then reveals himself to be a murderous psychopath -- spawned two sequels, launched the career of future ""Lost"" star Terry O'Quinn, and then pretty much disappeared. Now, like a horror-movie baddie you were sure was dead, ""The Stepfather"" is back for more. This remake stars ""Gossip Girl's"" Penn Badgley as a teen who returns from military school to find that a suspicious new guy (Dylan Walsh) has moved in with his divorced mom (Sela Ward). ""Dylan looks so accessible and sincere and warm,"" says Ward. ""I guess Ted Bundy did too."" Okay, now we're creeped out. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" (out Friday). Gerard Butler goes from family man to the meanest vigilante since Charles Bronson matching with Jamie Foxx in this action-thriller from director F. Gary Gray (""The Italian Job""). TV . ""Hell's Kitchen"" season finale (8 p.m., Tuesday, Fox). What ""Hell's Kitchen"" lacks in substance, it makes up for in style, and its slickly edited season finale is a sizzling nail-biter. Kitchen newbies will have no trouble following along as the three remaining chefs -- egotistical Kevin, coolheaded Ariel, and ""one-armed bandit"" Dave -- battle for Gordon Ramsay's foulmouthed approval. ""The Newlywed Game"" (6 p.m., Tuesday, GSN). George Takei and Brad Altman compete tonight, marking the first time a gay couple has ever been on the game show. ""30 Rock"" (9:30 p.m., Thursday, NBC). ""30 Rock"" is back? We want to go to there. NBC execs and Jay Leno, however, might not be so eager to visit, as Tina Fey kicks off season 4 with a barbed broadside against network programmers: When Jack (Alec Baldwin) forces Liz (Fey) to add a mainstream-friendly cast member to broaden her show's audience, Tracy Morgan's Tracy sweats his appeal to the common man, while Jenna (Jane Krakowski) gives herself a heartland-pandering country makeover. The satire on play-it-safe execs is wickedly droll. Also make sure to stay till the end to see Fey and Baldwin give a bitchy, meta ""welcome"" to their lead-out, Leno, whom Fey already jabbed at the Emmys by thanking NBC for keeping ""30 Rock"" on even though it's ""more expensive than a talk show."" Music . ""Christmas In the Heart,"" Bob Dylan (out Tuesday). What's that blowin' in the winter wind? Sounds like holiday cheer. Profits go to the hunger-relief charity Feeding America. ""Crazy Love,"" Michael Bublé (out Tuesday). Due, no doubt, to the success of his adult-contemporary smash ""Home,"" the neo-Rat Pack crooner makes a few too many soft-rock concessions on his new studio disc. Covering the Eagles, as Bublé does with a hokey version of ""Heartache Tonight,"" seems way beneath a singer with his level of style. Still, there's no denying the sexy-jerk swagger Bublé brings to ""Cry Me a River,"" which here sounds like a Bond-movie theme, or to ""Baby (You've Got What It Takes),"" a funky duet with Brooklyn soul sister Sharon Jones. ""Do What You Want, Be What You Are: The Music of Daryl Hall & John Oates,"" Hall & Oates box set (out Tuesday). Collecting the best of the blue-eyed soul smoothies, and making fans' dreams come true. EW recently asked Daryl Hall to fill us in on his personal favorites; for the record: ""She's Gone,"" ""Sara Smile,"" ""Every Time You Go Away,"" ""You Make My Dreams,"" and ""One on One."" DVD . ""The Proposal"" (out Tuesday). Yes, it's a rip-off of 1990's ""Green Card."" And sure, you can see every plot twist driving down Fifth Avenue. So the fact that ""The Proposal"" winds up as breezy and entertaining as it does qualifies as some sort of Hollywood miracle. Sandra Bullock plays an icy book editor about to get deported back to Canada unless she can find an American husband, stat. Ryan Reynolds is her long-suffering assistant, who conveniently happens to be single. Sham nuptials ensue. As the groom's dirty-bird grandma, Betty White is a hoot -- and frankly, the ho-hum extras (director's commentary, lame outtakes) could've used more of her. ""Drag Me to Hell"" (out Tuesday). Welcome back, Sam Raimi! The Spider-Man director returns to his delirious ""Evil Dead"" roots for ""Drag Me to Hell,"" a kick-ass ghost story about a bank officer (Alison Lohman) who denies a loan to the wrong gypsy woman. There are curses, maggots and -- thanks to this unrated version -- lots more gore and goo. Extras include a fantastic production diary. Books . ""Nine Dragons,"" Michael Connelly (out Tuesday). Michael Connelly writes fast-paced best-sellers that critics praise for their sharp characterizations and fluid storytelling. The appearance of a third Connelly title in a year would be excellent news if ""Nine Dragons,"" his latest offering, didn't read like it had been scribbled during a red-eye from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, the two cities where the slapdash action unfolds. ""Chronic City,"" Jonathan Lethem (out Tuesday). Lethem's latest novel follows the blank, descriptively named former teen actor Chase Insteadman as he floats, increasingly disoriented and adrift, between two New York worlds: one glamorous and social, the other bohemian and intellectual. Thick with paranoia, pot smoke and pop culture references (both real and made-up), ""Chronic City"" is a feverish portrait of the anxiety and isolation of modern Manhattan, full of dark humor and dazzling writing. The book's zonked philosophizing about the nature of reality wears a little thin, but Lethem's claustrophobic vision of a world where everything is connected and nothing is as it seems proves both funny and frightening.

1,"(CNN) -- Thursday brings one of the biggest slates of Hollywood entertainment to open on Christmas Day in many years. Tom Cruise stars as would-be Hitler assassin Col. Claus von Stauffenberg in the World War II drama ""Valkyrie."" Stars such as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler are featured in a slew of big-budget movies hoping to lure people into theaters this holiday season. Here are the top five movies opening Thursday: . 1. ""Valkyrie"" -- Tom Cruise stars in the true story of a German military officer who conspires to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Cruise plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, a proud military man who realizes that Hitler must be stopped before Germany and Europe collapse under Nazi rule. Joining Cruise are three-time Oscar nominee Kenneth Branagh as Maj. Gen. Henning von Tresckow and twice-nominated actor Tom Wilkinson as Gen. Friedrich Fromm. United Artists is releasing the film. 2. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" -- Brad Pitt stars in this fantasy drama about a man who ages backward. He's born in his 80s and then gets younger as the years pass. ""Button"" is based on the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and runs two hours and 47 minutes. The cast includes Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett, who is creating Oscar buzz this year as well for her portrayal of Daisy in ""Button."" The film, released by Paramount Pictures, already has won several film critics' awards. 3. ""Marley & Me"" -- Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston learn life lessons from an out-of-control canine they decide to adopt. This comedy-drama is adapted from the best-selling novel by John Grogan. Some audiences expecting a feel-good comedy such as ""Turner & Hooch"" or ""Beethoven"" may be surprised by this painfully realistic portrayal that could leave audiences teary-eyed at the end. The supporting cast includes Alan Arkin and Kathleen Turner. The PG-rated film gets a 20th Century Fox release. 4. ""Bedtime Stories"" -- Funny guy Adam Sandler shoots for the family crowd with this fantasy comedy about a hotel handyman who tells his niece and nephew a bedtime story, only to find out that his fantasy stylings are coming true. Sandler's film, which also stars Guy Pearce, Courteney Cox and Keri Russell, is getting mixed reviews so far. It's rated PG for mild rude humor and mild language. 5. ""The Spirit"" -- Based on a graphic novel about a masked crusader, ""The Spirit"" will cater to the so-called fanboys who hope the film's PG-13 rating will push the envelope on violence and other cool stuff. iReport.com: Will you see any of the new movies on tap during the holidays? Gabriel Macht plays Denny Colt, aka The Spirit, in this story of a man who fakes his death so he can fight a coldblooded killer known as the Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson). Eva Mendes is along for the ride, which could be a plus for the film's desired demographic of young men 13 to 21. Lionsgate is distributing.",0.766819,2521
2,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Oscar said yes to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to European actors on Sunday night. Actors Daniel Day-Lewis, Tilda Swinton, Marion Cotillard and Javier Bardem toast their success. ""No Country,"" the Coen brothers' brutal tale of a man pursued by death and the law across the bleak moonscapes of West Texas, won best picture at the 80th Academy Awards. The four acting awards, meanwhile, went to Europeans: Marion Cotillard, Daniel Day-Lewis, Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton. The Coens also won best director and best adapted screenplay, and Bardem, who played cattle-gun-armed killer Anton Chigurh, won best supporting actor. Producer Scott Rudin shared the best picture award with the brothers. ""We're very thankful to all of you out there for letting us continue to play in our corner of the sandbox, so thank you very much,"" Joel Coen said in accepting the directing award. He observed that the pair didn't think they were doing much different work now from when, as a child, Ethan Coen ""got a suit and a briefcase and we went to the Minneapolis International Airport with a Super 8 camera and made a movie about shuttle diplomacy called 'Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go.' ""  Watch the best of the winners' backstage remarks » . The Coens, who have been known for their arch style and oddball humor in films such as ""Fargo,"" ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""The Big Lebowski,"" received some laughs for Ethan Coen's laconic acceptance speeches. After the pair won for adapted screenplay, Ethan Coen gave a brief thanks. Upon winning the directing award, he expanded on his speech slightly, sort of: ""I don't have a lot to add to what I said earlier. Thank you,"" he said. Day-Lewis was more effusive in his thanks after winning best actor for his performance as a misanthropic oilman in ""There Will Be Blood."" ""My deepest thanks to the members of the Academy for whacking me with the handsomest bludgeon in town,"" the British actor said as he accepted the award. ""I've been thinking a lot about fathers and sons in the course of this, and I'd like to accept this in the memory of my grandfather, Michael Balcon, my father, Cecil Day-Lewis, and my three fine boys, Gabriel, Ronan and Cashel,"" he added. See the complete list of winners . As he accepted his first Oscar, Bardem, one of Spain's top actors, thanked his directors and reflected on his role as a creepy killer with a bad haircut. ""Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to think that I could do that, and to put one of the most horrible haircuts in history over my head,"" he said.  Watch ""No Country"" win best picture » . It was his second career nomination. His other came for ""Before Night Falls"" (2000), in which he played Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. In a mild surprise, French actress Cotillard won her first Academy Award for her portrayal of singer Edith Piaf in ""La Vie en Rose."" Early handicappers had bet heavily on veteran Julie Christie, a previous Oscar winner who played a woman falling victim to Alzheimer's in ""Away from Her."" But Cotillard, who's received raves for her performance as the French singer, had been considered a strong contender for best actress. ""I'm speechless now ... I ... I ... thank you life, thank you love,"" Cotillard exclaimed. ""And it is true, there are some angels in this city. Thank you so, so much!"" The actress has appeared in dozens of films in her native France, but she may be most recognizable to American audiences for her performances in ""A Very Long Engagement"" (2004) and ""Big Fish"" (2003). In a highly competitive race, Swinton nabbed the best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal as lawyer Karen Crowder in the legal drama ""Michael Clayton."" ""I have an American agent who is the spitting image of this. Really, truly, the same shape head and, it has to be said, the buttocks,"" the British actress said, examining her new Oscar. ""And I'm giving this to him because there's no way I'd be in America at all, ever, on a plane if it wasn't for him.""  See Swinton on the red carpet » . Swinton beat out 83-year-old Ruby Dee, who had been considered a sentimental favorite for her first Oscar nomination in the supporting actress category, playing Mama Lucas to Denzel Washington's drug kingpin Frank Lucas in ""American Gangster."" Swinton also beat Cate Blanchett (as a mid-'60s take on Bob Dylan in ""I'm Not There"") and Amy Ryan (a difficult working-class mother in ""Gone Baby Gone""). The Academy Awards opened with host Jon Stewart joking about the recently ended writers strike -- which forced a cutback in the Golden Globes and threatened the Oscars as well -- and commenting on the bleakness of the best picture nominees. ""Tonight we look beyond the dark days to focus on happier fare: This year's slate of Oscar-nominated psychopathic killer movies,"" Stewart joked. ""Does this town need a hug? What happened? 'No Country For Old Men,' 'Sweeney Todd,' 'There Will Be Blood'? All I can say is, thank God for [the comedy ""Juno's""] teen pregnancy. I think the country agrees.""  Check out Oscar prep photos » . ""Juno"" has been the little movie that could all season. The film, which cost a relatively paltry $7.5 million, was the only best picture nominee to top $100 million at the box office, ensuring it a rooting interest from moviegoers. Star Ellen Page received plaudits for her performance as the title character, and screenwriter Diablo Cody -- famously a former stripper -- has become one of Hollywood's ""it"" scribes. Cody won best original screenplay. ""This is for the writers. I want to thank all the writers. I especially want to thank my fellow nominees because I worship you guys and I'm learning from you every day,"" Cody said. The first award of the evening, for costume design, went to ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age."" The best animated feature went to ""Ratatouille,"" a computer-animated Pixar film directed and written by Oscar winner Brad Bird (""The Incredibles""). The rat-turns-chef movie beat out ""Persepolis,"" based on the graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, and ""Surf's Up,"" a computer-animated film about penguins. ""The Counterfeiters"" from Austria took the best foreign-language film. The movie is based on a true story about a counterfeiter who, after being sent to a concentration camp, was employed by the Nazis to fake other countries' currency. Best original song was awarded to ""Falling Slowly"" from ""Once."" It beat out three songs from ""Enchanted,"" the Disney film about an animated princess come to life. The Oscars were spread around. ""No Country"" picked up four, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" earned three (one for its rapid-fire editing) and ""There Will Be Blood"" received two: Day-Lewis' acting award and Robert Elswit's cinematography honor. But nobody had any doubt what film was considered the evening's big winner. ""There's nothing like it, and especially with these two guys,"" producer Rudin said backstage with the Coens of their unusual Western. ""I'm incredibly proud, and I think it's the best movie we have been involved with. I loved it from the first minute I saw it."" E-mail to a friend .",0.75816,282
3,"(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine Meryl Streep having second thoughts about tackling any role, but the actress admits that she had doubts about ""Doubt,"" her newest project. The cast of ""Doubt,"" from left: Viola Davis, Amy Adams, Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film -- based on a Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning play by the same name -- examines what happens when a strict nun who heads a Catholic school in the Bronx suspects a charismatic priest of having an inappropriate relationship with a student. ""I actually didn't think it would ever be a movie,"" Streep said. ""It was so thoroughly realized on stage, and it was so minimal. It was hard to imagine how or why you would make a movie out of it."" But Streep, who plays the terrifyingly severe and determined school principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, said she changed her mind when she saw the final product. ""How did they make the play without any children in it? It is just sort of amazing to me, because to me they are sort of the landscape. They are the lambs of the movie. They are the stakes. They are why everybody is passionate."" Her co-stars are passionate about sharing the screen with a Hollywood legend. Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays the priest targeted by Streep's character in the film, says he ""adores"" her. Amy Adams calls Streep ""a sweetheart."" Viola Davis says she's ""just fantastic."" Davis' performance in the movie is generating Oscar buzz, with Streep advising the actress to pick out a dress for the Academy Awards. Davis, who plays the mother of the student at the center of the sexual abuse allegations at the school, said she drew on the experiences of her mom and other women she knows to bring the role to life. She expressed awe about any suggestion of an Oscar nomination. ""It's surreal. I don't know how to respond to that anymore,"" Davis said. ""All I wanted to do was good work. ... Everything else is just the icing on the cake."" The movie is set in 1964, but the play was written by John Patrick Shanley after the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Roman Catholic Church several years ago. Hoffman -- who plays Father Flynn, the priest under fire -- said the lurid headlines about molested children weren't even on his mind when he took on the project. ""It is really about something else. If people see it, they will know what I mean about that,"" Hoffman said. Some have suggested that the play served as a criticism of the Bush administration's dogged belief that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Shanley, who won an Academy Award for his screenplay of ""Moonstruck,"" told Entertainment Weekly that the play did have a political point. ""I'm not interested in morality,"" he told the magazine. ""One of my larger premises in doing this play, in what's not said, is that doubt itself is a passionate exercise. I think it's perceived in this culture as something weak or denatured, and that's a huge mistake."" Adams said she became ""a little obsessed"" with the adaptation of the play to the big screen. She plays Sister James, a nun who expresses her suspicions about Father Flynn's relationship with the student to Sister Aloysius. The movie is a departure for Adams, who became famous for sunnier roles in films like ""Enchanted"" and ""Talladega Nights."" But she said she doesn't mind being known as an eternally cheerful actress, because that description reflects ""75 percent"" of her real persona. ""There's 25 percent that's probably dark and grumpy and not personable at all, but I keep her at home,"" Adams said. As for Oscar buzz surrounding her performance, the actress said she's keeping her fingers crossed for Streep and Davis to be nominated for their roles in ""Doubt"" but has no expectations for herself. ""It's always fun ,and I would love to. If it doesn't happen for me, it's all right as well,"" Adams said. ""So, the experience of making the film was my get in this case.""",0.7561935,1462
4,"CANNES, France (CNN) -- The line-up at this year's Cannes Film Festival is a cineaste's dream. There are high expectations for Jane Campion's ""Bright Star,"" a drama about 19th-century poet John Keats. Packed with big name auteurs (Pedro Almodovar, Ken Loach, Lars Von Trier, Quentin Tarantino, and Park Chan-wook among others) and intriguing propositions, the competition for the coveted Palme d'Or is sure to be fierce. While there may be a dearth of surprises in the line-up, the world's shiniest cinema event has certainly proved that in these tough economic times it can still cherry pick the best of what's out there. But what among the dizzying array of celluloid magic has caught the eye of industry insiders and professionals? The Screening Room asked a blogger, a critic and a film buyer attending the festival what films they will be watching out for at this year's event. THE CRITIC . Name: Jonathan Romney . Credentials: Film critic for British newspaper The Independent on Sunday . Cannes experience: 17 years . It's heavily loaded with big names and the strange thing is that this year there are very few surprises in there. Last year there was Italian Matteo Garrone's ""Gomorrah"" (which won the Grand Prize) and Israeli Ari Folman's animation ""Waltz with Bashir,"" films that nobody knew anything about in competition. The one that people are either really looking forward to or dreading is ""Enter the Void,"" Gaspar Noe's new film. Noe gave everybody a rough time in 2002 with ""Irreversible,"" a violent, confrontational rape-revenge drama. The thing about him is once he's got you in the cinema you're not going to get out. This one has been made in Japan and is the story of someone looking at the events leading up to their own death. In particular, I'll be looking at Jane Campion's film, ""Bright Star,"" starring Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw. It's based on the three-year romance between 19th-century poet Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by his death at the age of 25. She hasn't delivered for quite a while. Her last few films were at best patchy and at worst disappointing. She's shown skill at her version of costume dramas in the past with films like ""The Piano,"" which won the Palme d'Or in 1994. Five-times Palme d'Or nominated German[-born] Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"" is another film people are talking about. It is set in 1914 and is apparently about the emergence of Nazism. I imagine it will be fairly austere and confrontational. I also imagine it will be very good. He has never made a film that doesn't really engage or impress on some level. There's also Danish Cannes stalwart Lars von Trier's film ""Antichrist,"" starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg about a grieving couple who retreat to a small cabin in the forest to mourn following the death of their child. There has been some controversy over why he is making what looks like a conventional Hollywood horror. It almost certainly won't be that. I suspect it will be philosophical. A lot of these filmmakers are not entertainers. They like to give their audiences a hard time. One of the keynotes of this year is going to be confrontation. THE BLOGGER . Name: Karina Longworth . Credentials: Co-founder of Cinematical film blog and editor of Spout blog . Cannes experience: two years . In the Directors' Fortnight section I'm really excited about ""Go Get Some Rosemary,"" which is directed by these two young American brothers, Joshua and Benny Safdie. Their style is reminiscent of the French New Wave -- but with this sense of humor and willingness to experiment in real locations, and use the people that are walking by as accidental characters. They're sometimes lumped together with the young American ""Mumblecore"" scene but their films are really different. They've got a really interesting sense of style. Another film I'm really excited about is a documentary by French Oscar-winner Michel Gondry. The English title is ""The Thorn in the Heart,"" and it is about his aunt. Because it is in the Special Screening section and it's not in competition, it won't get the full red carpet treatment. But while the international press is looking the other way, if it's really good it could stand out from the crowd. Of course I'm excited to see a Quentin Tarantino movie, but my experience of being at Cannes is that going to see one of those giant films ends up taking all day long. I try to go and see films that I might not ever be able to see again. The film I'm most excited about seeing is Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist."" It looks sort of ""Rosemary's Baby""-ish and it is a return to working in English with American-known actors. I'm also looking forward to Jane Campion's new film. THE BUYER . Name: Robert Walak . Credentials: Senior vice-president, Acquisitions Worldwide, Momentum Pictures . Cannes experience: seven years . Sometimes a film is going to ""pop"" where you least expect it, and it's often not the film with established directors. It's quite difficult to find those -- the ones that create industry buzz, the ones that the critics suddenly go for, but also when you finally do get around to releasing it in your territory that the film actually crosses over and becomes an art house hit. I've already read the scripts for a lot of the films in competition -- you really want to get all of the information and do your homework. This year there's buzz about a film by an Iranian director, Bahman Qobadi, called ""No One Knows Persian Cats,"" which is being sold by innovative production company Wild Bunch. Qobadi has served as a juror on the Cannes jury before and took home a Golden Camera award in 2000 for ""A Time for Drunken Horses,"" a drama about young Iranian Kurds. I'm also looking forward to ""Antichrist."" It's going to be interesting to see what von Triers' take on a horror movie is going to be. The script was off the wall and I want to see how he brings it all together. The Ken Loach film ""Looking for Eric,"" which stars ex-footballer Eric Cantona, is meant to be fantastic. It's already sold in the UK but the script was wonderful and I think it's going to be a very distinctive, different film for Loach. Feel-good is a very overused term, but people are going to be looking for more feel-good films now anyway.",0.7557633,6843
5,"(CNN) -- Perhaps it really WAS destiny. ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the little film that overcame tremendous odds simply to earn an American release, won eight Oscars Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards, including best picture. ""Most of all we had passion and we had belief, and our film shows if you have those two things, you have everything,"" said producer Christian Colson, surrounded by many members of the film's huge cast and crew. It was a supremely unlikely success story. ""Millionaire,"" which combines elements of Bollywood melodrama and documentary grit, features no stars. It's set largely among the poverty-stricken districts of Mumbai, India, and one-third of the film is in Hindi. Its initially reluctant director, Danny Boyle, is better known for brash British films such as ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later."" And the film almost went straight to DVD in America, thanks to the folding of initial studio Warner Independent Pictures (like CNN, it's a unit of Time Warner). But the film's orphaned, poverty-raised hero, played by Dev Patel, overcomes his challenges to earn a spot on the game show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" -- not necessarily to win money, but to connect with his lost love. On the show, he's told that perhaps he is a figure of destiny. ""It is written,"" the show's smarmy host tells him, somewhat mockingly, after Patel's character aces several questions. List of winners, nominees . ""Slumdog's"" filmmakers were jubilant at the wins, which also included Oscars for best director (Boyle), best adapted screenplay (Simon Beaufoy), score (A.R. Rahman), cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle), song, sound mixing and film editing. Boyle jumped up and down as he accepted his award, saying he'd told his children that if he ever won, he'd bounce like Tigger from ""Winnie-the-Pooh."" Rahman was equally appreciative. ""All my life I've had a choice between hate and love, and I chose love, and now I'm here,"" he said.  Gallery: See what the stars are wearing » . ""Slumdog's"" main competition, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" won just three Oscars, all in minor categories. The film had led the pack with 13 nominations. The rest of the Oscar broadcast alternated between host Hugh Jackman's smooth song-and-dance numbers, some comic moments from Steve Martin, Tina Fey and Ben Stiller, and politics, generally focused on gay rights and California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8. Sean Penn won best actor for playing Harvey Milk in ""Milk,"" the story of the first openly gay man elected to major public office. Penn earned laughs and applause for his speech. iReport.com: What do you think of the winners? ""You commie homo-loving sons of guns,"" the sometimes truculent actor began, to laughter. ""I did not expect this, and I wanted to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me, often. But I am touched by the appreciation."" After a series of thank-you's, he turned serious in talking about gay marriage. ""For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight, I think it's a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect on their great shame and their shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that support,"" Penn said. ""We've got to have equal rights for everyone."" Dustin Lance Black, who won original screenplay for ""Milk,"" also gave an impassioned speech in favor of gay rights. ""I think [Milk] would want me to say to all the gay and lesbian kids out there tonight ... that you are beautiful, wonderful creatures of value, and that no matter what anyone tells you, God does love you and that very soon, I promise you, you will have equal rights, federally, across this great nation of ours."" Heath Ledger won best supporting actor for his performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" His parents and sister accepted the award for the actor, who died in January 2008. ""This award tonight would have humbly validated Heath's quiet determination to be truly accepted by you all here -- his peers -- within an industry he truly loved,"" said Ledger's father, Kim. Ledger is only the second actor to win a posthumous actor. Peter Finch won best actor for 1976's ""Network"" two months after he died in early 1977. Other winners included Kate Winslet, who won best actress for her performance in ""The Reader""; Penelope Cruz, who won best supporting actress honor for ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""; and ""WALL-E,"" which won best animated feature. Most of the winners, if not foreordained, were expected. The evening's sole shock came with best foreign-language film, which went to the Japanese film ""Departures."" Among the films it beat were France's ""The Class"" and Israel's ""Dances With Bashir,"" two of the best-reviewed films of the year. The Oscars moved at a steady pace, largely thanks to Jackman's brisk, jokey work. Only the introductions to the four acting categories, in which previous winners read tributes to current nominees as if they were about to appear on ""This Is Your Life,"" considerably slowed the show, which ran close to three and a half hours. At various points, Jackman cracked wise about downsizing -- ""Next year,"" said the ""Australia"" star, ""I'll be starring in a movie called 'New Zealand' "" -- performed songs about each best picture nominee in various musical styles, and paid tribute to various celebrities as if pointing out VIPs in a nightclub. He even physically carried Anne Hathaway on stage to play Richard Nixon in a ""Frost/Nixon"" send-up. Blog: Behind the scenes . But it was ""Slumdog Millionaire"" that carried the evening. At one point, Resul Pookutty, who won for sound mixing, seemed overwhelmed as he accepted his Oscar. ""I dedicate this award to my country,"" he said. ""Thank you, Academy, this is not just a sound award, this is history being handed over to me."" Given the import of East meeting West, the movie business can say the same thing.",0.75408953,2586
6,"(CNN) -- Remember the worst job you ever had? You know, back when there were jobs to be had? Jesse Eisenberg tries to strike up a relationship with Kristen Stewart in ""Adventureland."" For writer-director Greg Mottola, it was the summer he spent on hiatus between college and the real world, working as a carny at the local carnival. He's turned the experience into the basis for the wonderful ""Adventureland."" Handing out stuffed animals to the lucky customer whose tin horse romps home in first place -- this is not how James (Jesse Eisenberg from ""The Squid and the Whale"") would choose to see himself. The paycheck is dismal, but undeniably commensurate with (as a character puts it) ""the work of pathetic, lazy morons,"" which is what it comes down to. Most jobs have their compensations, though. At Adventureland, for James, the biggest benefit comes in the form of Em (Kristen Stewart), another recent grad with plans to move to New York in the fall, and who isn't entirely disdainful of his company. Last time out of the gate Mottola enjoyed a hit with the spectacularly lewd ""Superbad,"" an angle that Miramax Films is understandably keen to play up in the marketing this time around. At first glance the cap seems to fit. James' sexual experience -- or rather the lack of it -- is a defining element in the story. ""Adventureland"" comes with the usual farcical peccadilloes of teen comedy -- barf gags, car wrecks and inopportune erections -- as well as several familiar supporting players from the Judd Apatow stable. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig are engagingly upbeat as the mutually besotted park managers, and Martin Starr (from ""Freaks and Geeks"") is James' cerebral, pipe-smoking buddy, Joel. (Mottola directed a couple of episodes of Apatow's short-lived Fox series ""Undeclared."") There's also an extended cameo from Ryan Reynolds, an actor whose faintly supercilious good looks have graced innumerable dumb slacker comedies, including ""Van Wilder,"" ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" and ""Waiting."" Yet, after an initial flurry of gross guffaws, the movie edges toward something rather different: a nuanced, sensitive coming-of-age story that finds its heart in post-adolescent romantic turmoil. Obviously adept with actors, Mottola respects his characters too much to let first impressions stick. The relationships in ""Adventureland"" are much richer, and stickier, for it. The understanding that James arrives at with his father (Jack Gilpin), for example, is delineated in just a handful of looks and glances between them, but it's enough to imply the older man's resignation at his fate, and his appreciation for James' tacit sympathy. It's in moments like these (and there are a number of them) that we're reminded Mottola made a fine indie movie, ""The Daytrippers,"" more than a decade ago now, another sharp and tender comic distillation of family bonds and fractures. Blessed with comical seriousness, Eisenberg is like a young Woody Allen: fretful, intelligent, naive and deluded. And like Allen, he seems to enjoy more than his fair share of luck with the opposite sex. Still, ""Adventureland"" makes more effort than ""Superbad"" -- not that hard admittedly -- to develop a character for Stewart. Looking wan and pensive (the ""Twilight"" star always looks in need of a good night's sleep), Stewart as Em gives the impression she's living life more acutely than the others. She seems to have more on the line. Set in the mid-'80s, the film suggests the period unobtrusively, but predominantly through pop music. Lou Reed provides sweet relief to repeated bursts of Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus."" Yes, in retrospect, that's exactly what being young in 1987 was like. A mature movie about immature young people, ""Adventureland"" may be too muted to succeed in today's marketplace, too sensitive for its own good. Like an anxious parent, a critic can only send it on its way and hope the world treats it well. ""Adventureland"" is rated R and runs 107 minutes.

7,"COPENHAGEN, Denamrk (CNN) -- What makes someone decide to become an actor? It sometimes seems as if the average Hollywood star is motivated mainly by the promise of a fat pay check. Connie Nielsen shot to fame playing Lucilla in ""Gladiator."" Or perhaps they're drawn to the celebrity lifestyle. Maybe they crave the love of an adoring public, or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world, to be immortalized on celluloid. For Danish actress Connie Nielsen it was something quite different. For her, being an actor means being an outsider. ""As an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider. If you're an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside don't dare to say,"" she told CNN. So Connie Nielsen is not your typical movie star. As a 5-foot-10-inch blonde Scandinavian beauty she has the looks of a classic silver screen siren, but she has steadfastly resisted a career as Hollywood eye candy and rejected the lifestyle that goes with it. ""I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business,"" she says. ""I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth,"" she says. Raised in Elling, a small coastal village in Denmark, she is fluent in seven languages and studied acting in France and Italy, making her screen debut in French comedy ""Par Où T'es Rentré? On T'a Pas Vu Sortir"" (U.S. title ""How Did You Get In? We Didn't See You Leave"") in 1984. She appeared in more French and Italian movies before landing a role opposite Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves in ""The Devil's Advocate"" in 1997. But it wasn't until 2000, when she was cast in Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ""Gladiator"", that Nielsen landed a role that really let her show her acting ability. As Lucilla, the sister of the villainous Emperor Commodus, Nielsen brought some much-needed subtlety to the swords-and-sandals epic and held her own sharing the screen with Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe. The movie made Nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with ""One Hour Photo"" in 2002, and ""The Hunted"" in 2003. But while the success of ""Gladiator"" opened doors for her, it also meant she had to fight the kind of typecasting that would try to limit her to playing ""the love interest"" to a male lead who got all the good lines. Nielsen has in the past been critical of Hollywood for its lack of female roles, saying ""you think once you've shown what you can do, and your movies have been successful, that snap, you work. So to discover the difference between guys' roles and girls' roles made me plain mad. It's unjust."" But Nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed, seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies. She appeared in French movie ""Demonlover"", which dealt with pornography, violence and corporate amorality, while more recent films have taken on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Danish drama ""Brødre"" (U.S. title ""Brothers"") is about a soldier who returns from Afghanistan a broken man, unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict. Playing his wife, Nielsen put in a powerful performance that won her awards and served to highlight how Hollywood had underused her talents. ""The Situation"" in 2006 was billed as the first film to be made about the Iraq war and told the story of ordinary Iraqis caught up in the conflict, while ""Battle of Seattle"" examined how peaceful protests erupted into riots when the World Trade Organization met in Seattle in 1999. Of her choice of subject matter, Nielsen says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts. But Nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies. She is passionate about literature and art and she is currently dating Lars Ulrich, drummer of rock group Metallica. She had a son with him in 2007 and has another son from a previous relationship. ""I will always find something that I want to try and become better at. I always love to spend more time with my friends, more time with my family, my extended family. I always want to read more books,"" she says. Perhaps her commitment to her art, her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her Danish upbringing, but there's no doubt that compared to many other Hollywood stars Connie Nielsen is a breath of fresh air.",0.7444799,828
8,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- In the movies, ""the suburbs"" are never just a place. They're a state of mind, a mythology we all know in our bones. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio share a happy moment in ""Revolutionary Road."" The myth goes something like this: The suburbs are comfortable, maybe even beautiful, but their serenity is rooted in a friendly American conformity, so that the people who live there have to repress their true selves, which will emerge when they drink too much and have affairs, or rage at each other for their dishonesty, which was all caused in the first place by ... the suburbs. The best thing about ""Revolutionary Road,"" a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there. Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are about 30, with two kids, and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence they've chosen. The year is 1955, and Frank has a New York job that bores him, marketing business machines. He takes solace in feeling superior to his work, and also in his midday martinis and occasional dip into the secretarial pool. April, meanwhile, wanted to be an actress, and still feels she's meant for higher things.  Watch DiCaprio and Winslet talk about their reunion » . Moved to reach for something more, April comes up with a plan: She and Frank will sell their home and move to Paris, where she'll work as a government secretary and he will ... find himself. (It's like a '60s fantasy a decade ahead of time.) ""Revolutionary Road"" was directed by Sam Mendes, who made the glibly scathing ""American Beauty,"" only here he wants us to share not just Frank and April's misery but the frail reveries that hold them together. The escape-to-Paris idea is naive, impractical -- a pipe dream. Yet it's fueled by something Mendes captures about the '50s, an era when people often had deep imaginative sparks that exceeded their ability to voice them. Winslet has the tricky job of making us see the glimmer of wisdom in April's cockeyed plan, and she pulls it off, even as DiCaprio's Frank -- chipper, forthright, wholesome even in betrayal -- tugs the couple back to reality. ""Revolutionary Road"" has deception, adultery, operatic shouting, the then-forbidden specter of abortion, and a few scenes that spotlight the remarkable performance of Michael Shannon as John Givings, a mathematician who's been hospitalized for insanity, and who proves how unfit for society he is by making every acid comment cut to the truths that no one else will speak. The film is lavishly dark -- some might say too dark -- yet I'd suggest it has a different limitation: For all its shattering domestic discord, there's something remote and aestheticized about it. April brings a private well of conflict to her middle-class prison, but Winslet is so meticulous in her telegraphed despair that she intrigues us, moves us, yet never quite touches our unguarded nerves.

10,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- There's no question ""Tropic Thunder"" takes chances. Ben Stiller, left, and Robert Downey Jr. are among the stars of ""Tropic Thunder,"" a Hollywood satire. Tom Cruise almost unrecognizable as a foulmouthed, foul-mannered movie executive? Check. Mockery of action heroes, Method actors and gross-out comedians? Check. Challenging stereotypes at every opportunity? Absolutely. But casting Robert Downey Jr. as a black man? Well, that might be a bit much. Or maybe not. In ""Tropic Thunder,"" a comedy about self-absorbed Hollywood types making a ""Platoon""-style war movie, Downey plays Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, a multiple Oscar-winning performer who gets so involved in his roles that he forgets to come out of them. He's a man constantly looking for ways to transform himself for his art. So, cast as a black man in the war movie, Lazarus decides to dye his skin surgically. Downey -- no slouch as an actor himself -- has often been seen as one who immerses himself fully in his roles. That kind of dedication prevented the character from coming off as offensive, said Ben Stiller, who directed, co-wrote and stars in ""Tropic Thunder."" ""I give all the credit to Robert,"" Stiller told CNN. ""I felt he really was so committed to that character, the guy that was playing that guy, that as an audience you bought his sincerity. Very few people, I think, could pull that off."" Brandon Jackson, who plays hip-hop star turned actor Alpa Chino (say it fast), agreed. ""Robert was black the whole time. My mom came on the set and she thought it was Don Cheadle,"" he told CNN. ""I'm serious. That's how black he was.""  Watch Jackson talk about working with Downey » . The movie, which also stars Stiller as struggling action star Tugg Speedman and Jack Black as gross-out king Jeff Portnoy, features some testy altercations between Downey's Lazarus and Jackson's Chino. Lazarus gets so involved in his role that even when it's clear filming has wrapped for the day, he sticks with it -- which irritates Chino to no end. ""To me the most important thing was Alpa Chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what he's doing is crazy the whole time,"" Downey said. ""Otherwise it's just demeaning to Brandon's character. And if it's demeaning to an actual black man in the movie ... I would have run for the hills."" Jackson said he would have challenged the movie if the material was offensive. But, he said, ""Tropic Thunder"" is a long way from the days when white performers would don blackface as a way of exploiting black stereotypes. Since then, he said, the playing field has leveled: The Wayans brothers played ""White Chicks"" in the film of the same name, and Eddie Murphy has played several ethnicities in his films, including Jewish and Chinese characters. ""If we're all gonna play ball, let's all play ball,"" Jackson said. ""I believe in fairness. If we can punch you, punch back. And funny is funny."" iReport.com: Will you see 'Tropic Thunder'? Stiller, of course, is no stranger to testing comedy limits. The actor, writer and director, known for films such as ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Zoolander,"" has performed or created roles that strike a delicate balance between sympathetic and distasteful -- and sometimes fall too hard on one side of the line. He co-wrote ""Tropic Thunder"" based on an idea he had in 1987, when many of his friends were making war movies, he recalls in the film's production notes. While Stiller was making ""Empire of the Sun,"" his colleagues were in boot camps training for their military roles -- and would emerge talking about the boot camp as if they'd become part of a real military unit. ""This sort of self-important, self-involved thing seemed funny to me,"" he said in the notes. ""I just couldn't figure a way to make that into a movie."" Not immediately, anyway. But after several years, Stiller and his colleagues worked out a story that not only mocked actors, but filmmaking in general. In ""Thunder,"" after the studio threatens to shut down the big-budget production, the frustrated director (played by Steve Coogan) refuses to stop, and takes his cast deep into a Southeast Asia jungle to shoot ""guerrilla style."" There they encounter danger in the form of drug lords. ""Tropic Thunder,"" which already has received praise from Newsweek's David Ansen and The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt, has also earned its share of knocks. The most serious have come from advocacy groups for the disabled, which are planning to picket Monday's Los Angeles premiere. In the film, Speedman has made a bid for an Oscar by playing ""Simple Jack,"" a developmentally disabled character. Other characters in ""Tropic Thunder"" dismiss Speedman's attempt to play what they refer to as a ""retard."" Representatives of the Special Olympics, the Arc of the United States, the National Down Syndrome Congress, the American Association of People with Disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film, but DreamWorks did not make any changes. ""We are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population,"" said Peter Wheeler, a spokesman for the Special Olympics, according to Reuters. In a statement Sunday, Chip Sullivan, a DreamWorks spokesman, said the movie was ""an R-rated comedy that satirizes Hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations."" In the statement, Sullivan added that the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that DreamWorks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future. In junket interviews for the film, Stiller said that screening audiences definitely found ""Tropic Thunder"" funny. ""You go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think you're doing, of what you think is the right idea,"" he said. ""If people are accepting it the way that you intended, and you feel that from a general audience ... then stand behind it."" Downey trusts that after years of making themselves known as actors who can skillfully walk that fine line between funny and offensive, audiences will accept the film's satire -- his role in particular. ""I just hope at this point, with whatever little we've done to brand ourselves as entertainers, that you give us a little slack,"" he said.

11,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- At a time of economic uncertainty in the U.S., the writers strike cast a dark cloud over the eternal sunshine of the Californian mindset and its most glittering awards ceremony. Oscar winner Helen Mirren dazzled in Chopard diamonds last year and gained masses of publicity for the jeweler . Up until a fortnight ago, the million dollar question was whether the Oscars would go ahead as stars refused to cross the picket line. Make that the 400 million dollar question. According to the pundits and bean-counters, that's how much the strike would have cost Los Angeles and the industry if Hollywood's most glamorous evening had been cancelled. Not only would the stars have been robbed of their moment to shimmer along the world's most famous red carpet, but a whole hinterland of ancillary trades would be affected. Limo drivers driven to despair, caterers with no-one to cater for, make-up artists struggling to make up lost earnings and security teams facing an insecure future -- and the paparazzi would have no-one to focus on. But it's not just the little guys who would have lost out on the Oscars millions. Big-name jewelry designers like Chopard traditionally dress the stars. Kate Winslet, Charlize Theron and Hilary Swank are among their successful models at the Academy Awards. Last year, Helen Mirren wore a 55 carat diamond flower bracelet along with a 62 carat diamond brooch worth $4m dollars to accept the Best Actress gong. It is estimated that having a celebrity pictured in an item of jewelry or an outfit can be worth $1m in publicity for a jeweler or fashion house. With hundreds of celebrities strutting the red carpet on Oscars night, the scope for generating revenue is seemingly endless. But even Chopard's famous sparkle was tested by the uncertainty surrounding this year's event. ""Leading up to the Oscars business for the whole of Rodeo Drive was a little sketchy. Everyone was thinking, what's gonna happen?"" Wes Carroll, Chopard spokesman, told CNN. ""We felt for the writers, we felt for the studios and we wanted a great outcome for everyone. We would have been very disappointed had the Oscars not happened."" Films which achieve success at the Academy Awards can expect a new injection of cash with a boost in DVD sales and renewed interest at the box office. Robert Buchsbaum, a Los Angeles theater boss, told CNN, ""It's not just the studios who are affected by the Academy Awards show. It's theater owners. As a single-screen theater owner, my whole year is based on how well films perform from November through March through the Academy Awards. It's the busiest time of year for me."" ""We really try to figure out, not just what the big Academy Award film is gonna be -- the Best Picture -- but also the smaller films, the independent films which might get the edge like Juno and There Will Be Blood, films which will have a lot of legs to them once they get the nomination,"" he continued. ""It usually means between 25% and 75% in box office revenues alone."" The prime candidate for a new lease of life at the box office is the Coen Brothers' film, ""No Country for Old Men."" On the opposite side of the U.S., New York critics are expecting it to yield a decent crop of Oscars after taking their own awards night by storm. Stephen Whitty, Chair of the New York Film Critics' Circle, told CNN, ""It won best picture because the direction from the Coen brothers was really assured. They were completely in control of the mood throughout that film. ""I think the screenplay, also by the Coens, while being truthful to Cormack McCarthy's book, managed to turn it into cinema,"" he continued. ""It made it consistently visual and imparted its message and its mood through images. The acting -- and again, Javier Bardem got the fourth of the four awards we gave it -- I thought the acting was spot on throughout."" Will the rest of the results be equally clear cut? If so, the tips are Daniel Day Lewis and Julie Christie for Best Leads, Diablo Cody for Original Screenplay for ""Juno,"" ""Atonement"" for Best Score, Mike Moore for Best Documentary for ""Sicko,"" and in the Year of the Rat, Best Animation is marked for ""Ratatouille."" But of course, no one can really be that certain. Just ask producer Graham King, who seemed set to take Best Picture for ""The Aviator"" after it won virtually every award except the Nobel Peace Prize. But it wasn't to be, after Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" pipped him to the post. Then a year ago, King finally won the big one with ""The Departed."" One year on from winning the Oscar, he spoke with CNN's Quest team about how his life changed. ""I think for a good few months after the Academy Awards I was floating on air,"" he said. ""It was really hard to come down from it and it was hard to realize that you'd achieved the goal that you'd set out to achieve many years ago. There it is: in one night, you've got it."" And as King explains, even Oscar-winning Hollywood producers are prone to attacks of the jitters too. ""It was a year where I just took stock and decided what I wanted to do next and what kind of movies I want to make,"" he told CNN. ""Then, bam! We get hit with this strike, which was horrendous. I felt like I was unemployed ... your phone calls go from 60 or 70 a day to three and emails were not coming in and I felt really insecure about it."" For producers like King, the end of the writers strike is crucial for their business -- far more important than whether the Oscar ceremony takes place. But imagine being producer of the Best Picture in the one year when the ceremony was cancelled. And it's inconceivable to think of Hollywood without the Oscars. Picture Rio without its Carnival, London without the Queen, New York without the Statue of Liberty. The famous statuettes of Los Angeles may be somewhat smaller, but their presence is felt far beyond the Hollywood hills ... E-mail to a friend .",0.7394098,1595
12,"(CNN) -- ""Wolverine."" ""Star Trek."" ""Angels & Demons."" ""Terminator: Salvation."" The summer movies roll out, one weekend after another, like dreadnoughts leaving port to bombard a battle-scarred ocean. Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody star as ""The Brothers Bloom,"" a pair of successful con artists. So won't a little film about a pair of con-artist brothers, with nary an indestructible alloy in sight, get overrun by these blockbusters? Rian Johnson, the 35-year-old director of the charming ""The Brothers Bloom,"" doesn't see it that way. ""I actually kind of like it,"" he says of the strategy of premiering his film during summer movie season. (""Bloom"" opens Friday in limited release and expands nationwide May 29.) ""I feel like we're scampering in between the feet of these giants."" Make no mistake, adds Johnson: ""I love the big summer movies."" But, he says, audiences will see the big movie of the week ""and then want something different. That's the advantage coming out in this season has."" ""Bloom"" has already proved itself nimble.  Watch the stars talk about ""Bloom"" » . The film started earning buzz at the Toronto Film Festival last September, and its distributor, Summit Entertainment, launched a shrewd marketing campaign by putting the first seven minutes on the Internet earlier this year. Johnson, who directed the critically acclaimed ""Brick"" -- a film noir set in a high school -- has been praised for another inventive mix of genres, combining the con-man film with a touch of screwball comedy, some international intrigue and more than a little whimsy. Mark Ruffalo, who stars as Stephen Bloom, the mastermind of the duo, describes ""Brothers Bloom"" as ""its own world."" ""What I loved about it was its tonal shifts,"" he says. ""It goes from broad, almost slapstick stuff to the brother story and a love story. It's not traditional in that sense."" The film follows Stephen Bloom and his brother, played by Adrien Brody, as they embark on one last con: an attempt to swindle a wealthy shut-in, Penelope Stamp, played by Rachel Weisz. Instead of being upset, Penelope is tickled by the new world before her and the opportunities for freedom, even as the younger Bloom (simply called ""Bloom"") wants to move on to something else. Johnson is nothing if not a student of film, and ""Bloom"" features references to other con-man works. ""Paper Moon,"" with its examination of character, was a favorite, says Johnson. There are also nods to ""The Sting,"" David Mamet's works, and even Agatha Christie. But, as Ruffalo says, ""Bloom"" exists in its own world. Though the film is set in the present day, the Blooms wear suits and hats as if they walked out of 1910. Much of the film was shot in the sunny byways of coastal Eastern Europe, with its weathered 19th-century resorts and glamorous Old World style. (The backdrop made the story ""much more real for all of us,"" says Johnson.) Add Johnson's invocations of Fellini's ""8½,"" Marcello Mastroianni and (of all things) the Band documentary ""The Last Waltz"" to his cast, and Ruffalo says it was easy to find the film's personality. ""That was the starting point -- a threadbare elegance,"" he says. ""There's an appreciation of eccentricity,"" agrees Johnson. Whimsy can be hard to maintain, he says, but ""the heightened style comes from a story-based place."" (Johnson wrote the film's script.) That can be a lot for the moviegoing public of today -- weaned on CGI, armored rogues and thin romantic comedies -- to take in. But Johnson says he has faith ""The Brothers Bloom"" will find an audience. ""I'm pretty optimistic that with ... the ease with which media is now archived and made available to the public, I'm hoping that actually opens the doors for people to have more access to this stuff,"" he says. The director maintains a message board at rcjohnso.com, where young filmmakers ""constantly talk about older films,"" he says. In the film, Stephen Bloom says the perfect con is one in which ""everyone gets what they want."" Johnson (and his studio) hopes for a financial success, of course, but he couldn't be happier with the way ""The Brothers Bloom"" turned out. ""I learned so much doing this film,"" he says. ""It's like I got paid to go to grad school.""",0.7389735,5488
13,"(CNN) -- The economic downturn may take its toll at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, which opens Wednesday night. But as always, the show will go on. Eli Roth and Brad Pitt are men on a mission in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds."" Studios are cutting back on parties and all the glitz that goes with them, according to news reports. Moreover, there will be fewer people around to cover Cannes, as news organizations around the world trim costs. (Several, in fact, have tightened up by eliminating their movie reviewers.) Nevertheless, those who attend may see a bumper crop of good and intriguing films, Variety's Jay Weissberg told Reuters. ""We've all been hoping Cannes would pull something out of the bag to make us feel good again. On paper, they have."" Leah Rozen, film critic for People magazine, said there are several promising contenders for the Palme d'Or, Cannes' top prize, as well as a number of notable movies premiering out of competition. ""What Cannes really is, is an international festival, and you really see world cinema,"" she said. ""This year, there are 52 films that are going to be represented, of which 20 are in competition.""  See Rozen talk about some of this year's promising works » . Two of the films in competition are American: Quentin Tarantino's World War II movie, ""Inglourious Basterds,"" and Ang Lee's ""Taking Woodstock,"" a tale about the 1969 music festival. Tarantino told The New York Times that he's been hoping to do a war movie for years. ""You've got to make a movie about something, and I'm a film guy, so I think in terms of genres,"" he said. However, the maker of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" added, that doesn't mean what he ends up with resembles what he started with: ""It's simply the spark that starts the fire."" ""Inglourious Basterds"" was inspired by a 1978 Italian film that starred Bo Svenson (""Walking Tall, Part 2"") and football player-turned-actor Fred Williamson (""Black Caesar""). Tarantino's film, which he characterized to the Times as ""not a remake,"" stars Brad Pitt and Mike Myers. Cannes has been good to Tarantino; he won the Palme d'Or for ""Pulp Fiction"" 15 years ago. Buzz has been high on ""Basterds"" since Tarantino announced the project several years ago. ""Taking Woodstock,"" the new film by ""Brokeback Mountain"" director Lee, is based on the book by Elliot Tiber, whose hotelier parents owned a musical festival permit in Bethel, New York, where Woodstock was held. The cast includes Liev Schreiber, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Emile Hirsch, Imelda Staunton and Eugene Levy as Max Yasgur, on whose farm the festival was finally held. Other films in competition include Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist,"" Jane Campion's ""Bright Star"" and Pedro Almodovar's ""Broken Embraces.""  Gallery: Some of Cannes' recent winners » . But this year's Cannes festival is attracting plenty of attention for its out-of-competition films as well. The festival is opening with ""Up,"" the latest animated work from Pixar. ""That sort of breaks convention to open with what is, basically, a fancy cartoon,"" Rozen said. Also at Cannes will be Heath Ledger's last film, ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus."" The Oscar-winning ""Dark Knight"" actor died during the making of the Terry Gilliam film; Gilliam managed to complete it by doing some rewriting and casting other actors -- including Jude Law, Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp -- to play Ledger's part. Despite the interest in seeing Ledger, the film is still struggling to find a buyer, though Entertainment Weekly recently reported that a Los Angeles screening went over well. Cannes, which also functions as a huge film marketplace, may widen the net in attracting distributors. But much of the fun from Cannes comes from the films that emerge from nowhere. Recent winners of the Palme d'Or include 2000's ""Dancer in the Dark,"" which established singer Bjork as an actress, and ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,"" a Romanian film that ended up topping many critics' lists in 2007.

14,"(CNN) -- Maybe marriage to Kate Winslet isn't all that bad. Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski star as a couple on the road in the comedy ""Away We Go."" After cruelly dissecting marital malaise in ""American Beauty"" and again, just six months ago, in ""Revolutionary Road,"" Winslet's husband Sam Mendes takes a slightly more optimistic view of family life in the edgy comedy ""Away We Go."" Not that he's offering a whole-hearted endorsement of the institution. Burt and Verona (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) aren't legally bound -- she staunchly resists his repeated proposals -- but nevertheless they're a couple about to go nuclear: She's six months pregnant. He sells insurance to insurance companies. She's an illustrator with a lucrative line in anatomical drawings. Nevertheless, they're struggling to make ends meet. ""Are we losers?"" wonders Verona (only she uses a more colorful expression). ""We have cardboard windows... I think we must be."" Insomuch as they have a plan at all, it hinges on the support they're expecting from Burt's doting parents. So it's a nasty wake-up call when Jerry and Gloria (Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara) announce they're taking off for a new life in Belgium -- yes, even before the baby's out. There is a silver lining: Realizing they no longer have any reason to stay, Burt and Verona decide to widen their horizons. They could move to Arizona where Verona's sister lives. Burt has a job prospect in Madison, Wisconsin. Or they have college friends in Montreal. Their destiny awaits them, all they have to do is go out and find it. And away they go. Although the couple racks up a good few miles in their search for home, the movie doesn't betray much interest in location. Arizona is hot and arid. In Montreal they pour gravy on French fries. Don't expect cultural insights. It's never explained how these stragglers can afford such speculative wandering, and when they do find their dream home it's mystifying that it hasn't occurred to them before. Still, the movie's loose-limbed, spontaneous quality is a good part of its appeal, and a refreshing change of pace from other movies by Mendes, whose artfully designed compositions often seem self-conscious and painfully detached. In keeping with Indie-wood's vogue for shuffling snide satire and sentimentality (see ""Juno"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine""), ""Away We Go"" presents its trepidatious travelers with half a dozen starkly contrasted parental figures, including Allison Janney's monstrously vulgar alcoholic, Maggie Gyllenhaal's radical earth-mother (who has shortened her name to ""LN""), and Paul Schneider as Burt's rawly dumped brother, who wonders aloud if it would be wrong to tell his daughter her mom has been murdered. There's a level of bile here that some audiences may find alienating -- I can't see it being a big hit in Phoenix -- but Dave Eggers' and Vendela Vida's writing is a cut above the average, and it's performed with gusto. They may not be the most dynamic duo to hit the road, but the relationship between Burt and Verona feels touchingly true. Burt is a boy still trying on manhood for size (with a beard for extra emphasis), and though we've seen Krasinski do this before, he seems to have fine-tuned the performance to the point where he could very happily play it for the next two decades. Unlike his character, he's an actor who has found himself. Maya Rudolph is the joy of this picture. Give or take her role in Altman's ""Prairie Home Companion,"" the ""Saturday Night Live"" star hasn't made much impact in movies before now. With her frazzled, freckled face, she's not the glamour girl who would normally be shoe-horned into the romantic lead, but she seizes her chance and runs with it. Mendes brings out a more thoughtful and nuanced presence than the brittle comedienne, and Rudolph makes you consider how rarely we see a real woman at the center of things. Even her occasional tentativeness works for the part. Verona is so fresh and alert, she can't help but doubt herself as they trail from one family disaster to the next and wonder what kind of parents they are going to make. It's an uneven picture about the bumps in the road, and not immune to the odd dramatic shortcut or jocular cheap shot. But it does catch an anxiety that will be acutely familiar to anyone contemplating imminent parenthood, and -- in a beautifully judged cameo by Melanie Lynskey -- the deep anguish of someone who has had that prospect snatched away. More often than not, and where it really counts, ""Away We Go"" hits home. ""Away We Go"" is rated R and runs 98 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.",0.7318239,9854
16,"(CNN) -- At the time of his death, Heath Ledger had just concluded his work as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" the sequel to 2005's ""Batman Begins."" Heath Ledger died in January at age 28. He had been expected to hit new heights of stardom. The buzz surrounding his performance was electrifying. He was remaking the Joker; he wasn't a camp comedian like Cesar Romero or a malevolent clown like Jack Nicholson. He was pure nihilism, with his jagged makeup and ragged hair. Even glimpses of his smile on the ""Dark Knight"" movie posters were thrilling. And then he was gone. ""We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications,"" read the New York City medical examiner's office report, affectlessly. Who knows what could have happened? The hype surrounding ""The Dark Knight,"" partly fueled by Ledger's death, turned out to have been warranted; the film earned critical praise and planeloads of money. Ledger has been posthumously nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award and is expected to receive an Oscar nomination, as well. Had he lived, he could have named his price. We'll never know. ""Prediction is very difficult, especially of the future,"" the physicist Niels Bohr is credited with saying. Ledger's movie, ""The Dark Knight"" -- with its uncertain, bleak Gotham City --seemed symbolic of the year in entertainment. A writers' strike cast a pall over awards season. The paparazzi's favorite target, Britney Spears, was institutionalized for a time. Pixar's brilliant ""Wall-E"" depicted an Earth abandoned to the waste of consumerism.  See some of the year's top entertainment stories » . Even the presidential campaign, source of so many laughs for late-night comedians, was fraught with 3 a.m. phone calls and ""terrorist fist bumps."" Why wouldn't people be attracted to change and hope? Hollywood, usually a prime provider of optimism, is littered with the stories of lights put out early. James Dean was 24 when a Ford coupe crossed into his lane and hit his Porsche Spyder head-on near Cholame, California. River Phoenix was 23 when he died of a drug overdose outside the Viper Room in Hollywood. They are two of too many. So: On January 22, 2008, Heath Ledger was found dead in a New York apartment. He was 28. Asking ""what if"" is a dead end. ""Saturday Night Live,"" many years ago, used to mock it: What if Superman grew up in Nazi Germany? What if Eleanor Roosevelt could fly? The past is past, what's done is done, and the future can be fickle, anyway. So many of the year's stories had unexpected outcomes. Consider: For almost two decades, movie audiences eagerly awaited a new Indiana Jones film. This year, they got their wish with ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" and the film was widely criticized for taxing the credulousness of even its most dedicated fans. It's one thing to chat with a centuries-old Grail Knight, but surviving an A-bomb by hiding in a refrigerator? Not quite. Then there was the ultimate reality show: the election. If you'd polled media professionals last year, they might have named Hillary Clinton and Fred Thompson as the future nominees. John McCain's campaign was on life-support; Barack Obama's was struggling. We all know how things turned out. And the election also made a star -- a celebrity, if you will -- of Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate. Palin had a charisma -- the TV execs call it ""breakthrough"" -- that, at times, overshadowed the man at the top of the GOP ticket. iReport.com: What was your most memorable entertainment event this year? There was something else about Palin: She looked like Tina Fey, once the ""Weekend Update"" anchor and head writer for ""Saturday Night Live,"" now the star of the smart ""30 Rock."" Fey went back on her old show and had great success parodying Palin, driving ""SNL"" to some of its highest ratings in years. (Palin also looked like ""King of the Hill's"" Peggy Hill, but unlike Fey, the animated character wasn't a Second City-trained comedy performer who could strike in real time.) Some observers foresee a bright future for the Alaska governor; others believe she'll wear out her welcome. Time, again, will tell. Cast members of ""Saturday Night Live"" are object lessons: John Belushi and Chris Farley, gone before their times; Robert Downey Jr. (1985-86) emerges from a lifetime of troubles with two hit movies and Entertainment Weekly's Entertainer of the Year distinction. Other notables had a chance to live out three rich acts. Paul Newman, who epitomized the best qualities of a performer and human being -- thoughtful, charitable, capable, courageous -- died in September. Visionary author Arthur C. Clarke died in March; elemental guitarist Bo Diddley died in June. And comedian George Carlin, who viewed life as ""a ticket to the freak show"" and ""a zero-sum game,"" died in June. Carlin, who reveled in absurdity, had the right attitude to try to figure out ""what if."" In his surrealist way, he noted that the light at the end of the tunnel could be daylight -- or, maybe, an approaching train. Either way, it'll be here soon enough. ""The future,"" he once said, ""will soon be a thing of the past.""",0.72706664,4262
17,"(Mental Floss) -- They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing. But not for these folks! Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose. Alfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors. Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock . Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, ""Actors are cattle"" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: ""I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'"" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film ""The Lodger""), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career. Ayn Rand . The egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society. Rand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant. Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as ""spitting in your own face."" So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Orson Welles . When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as ""Citizen Kane"" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head. But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. In fact, ""Citizen Kane"" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party. Of course, after the unparalleled success of ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle. Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: ""In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?"" Frank Lloyd Wright . As the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it! Wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Wright, you're right. In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour. Wright's avant-garde floor plan included ""sleeping porches"" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round. In addition, Marcus' small bedroom ""cubicles"" came equipped with almost no closet space. When Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums. Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading. Salvador Dalí . ""Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dalí."" Yup, he actually said that. Everything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy. Criticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people. If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, ""The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable."" Need another telling quote? ""At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since."" Apparently, so did his ego. Al Jolson . Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled ""the world's greatest entertainer."" But Al Jolson really, really believed it. The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated ""Paris is a Paradise for Coons"" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over. From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world. But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).

18,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Despite the rain, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" shone brightly at the British Academy Awards Sunday, scooping a clutch of honors. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" director Danny Boyle shields composer A.R. Rahman from the rain as they arrive Sunday at the BAFTA awards in London. Not even the drizzle could dampen Danny Boyle's spirits as ""Slumdog,"" his Mumbai-set rags to riches movie phenomenon won a remarkable seven awards at the glitziest night in the UK film calendar. ""You make a film like this and you just hope and pray it will be seen by a few people,"" the British director told CNN. ""And the journey it's been on, the reception it's had around the world, has just been extraordinary."" Watch Danny Boyle, Dev Patel and Freida Pinto talking about ""Slumdog"" on the red carpet. As was widely expected, following its haul of four Golden Globes last month including Best Motion Picture, ""Slumdog"" took the Best Film award. ""I'd like to acknowledge the blood, sweat and tears of our cast,"" said the film's producer, Christian Colson who accepted the award. ""The film you saw is the film Danny Boyle imagined and it's very rare you can say that. He dreamed the dream, 24-hours a day, seven days a week for two and a half years."" Boyle's labors were recognized by the Academy, handing him the Director award, which he can add to the BAFTA he won for debut feature ""Shallow Grave"" in 1995. ""Slumdog"" has touched audiences and critics alike. Boyle thinks the film's extraordinary effect is down to its universal message of hope. ""It's the contrast I think between where the kid comes from and what he achieves,"" said Boyle. ""And he achieves everything on his own terms, and that gives you a kind of hope, really, which we all, no matter how romantic it is, we all need that."" Watch Bollywood legend and ""Slumdog"" star Anil Kapoor talking about the ""Slumdog"" phenomenon. ""Slumdog"" also won the Cinematography, Adapted Screenplay, Music, Sound and Editing awards. Closest rival David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" which was up for 11 awards, bagged only three. These included a richly-deserved Make Up & Hair award for the feat of transforming Brad Pitt into an octogenarian baby to tell the curious story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he ages. Actress Kate Winslet also continued her success streak, scoring the Leading Actress honor for her powerful portrayal of a former-Nazi concentration camp guard in Stephen Daldry's ""The Reader."" Conversely, Winslet both won and lost the award having been nominated twice in the same category, which included Meryl Streep for ""Doubt,"" and Kristin Scott Thomas for ""I've Loved You So Long."" But most eyes were on the actress to see if there would be a repeat performance of the breathlessly incoherent acceptance speech she made at the Golden Globes last month after winning two awards. ""These are really special moments. And I don't want to waste them,"" Winslet told CNN on the red carpet before going on to accept her award with no tears or obvious emotion. Instead she simply thanked her parents and the late Anthony Minghella and the late Sydney Pollack, two of the film's producers. Watch Kate Winslet talking about her ""amazing year"" on the red carpet. Reformed Hollywood badboy Mickey Rourke provided the only mild controversy of the night with a few expletives in his acceptance speech for the Best Actor award. ""Thank you Darren Aronofsky who gave me a second chance after I'd f***ed up my career for 15 years. Such a pleasure to be here, and be out of the darkness,"" he told the audience. Earlier, the actor told CNN how things have changed for him since the accolades started pouring in for his extraordinary performance in Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler."" ""I got a whole bunchy of new friends that I don't need,"" Rourke said. ""But I've also heard from some people that I'd worked with years ago that I'd burned bridges with that have come around. ""It's taken me a long time to change and come back and do things the right way. I'm just grateful for the second chance."" There were also gongs for Spain's Penelope Cruz, who took home Supporting Actress for her fiery scene-stealing performance as an unhinged artist in Woody Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" and the late Heath Ledger whose chilling reinvention of the Joker in Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" was recognized with the Supporting Actor award. Now, as attention turns to the upcoming Oscars, ""Slumdog's"" BAFTA wins will only increase the momentum behind the Best Picture nominee. After success at both the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, Kate Winslet could also be justified in looking forward to the Oscars with confidence.",0.72250926,4562
19,"(CNN) -- Cliché trailers and unimpressed movie reviews aside, ""The Bounty Hunter"" was still expected to perform decently at the box office last weekend, some guessing a gross in the neighborhood of $25 million. In reality, the predictions weren't far off -- the actual box office gross came in at nearly $21 million, which BoxOffice.com editor Phil Contrino described as a solid opening weekend, if a little on the low side. The true surprise, Contrino said, was Twentieth Century Fox's ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" coming out of nowhere and edging past it with an opening weekend gross of $22 million. ""It's a situation where there's a movie with no stars aimed at a very specific age group -- teenage boys -- and it beat a movie with two stars,"" he said. Yet, Contrino added, Aniston has never been really reliable to open a movie on her own, and she was the bigger star in ""Bounty."" Gerard Butler, her co-star, is gaining prominence but doesn't have the years of recognition that Aniston has. The actress was nearly inescapable in 2005 as the media tracked her divorce from actor Brad Pitt, but her thriller ""Derailed"" and romantic comedy ""Rumor Has It"" performed modestly at the box office. Aniston then came back with a hit in 2006 with ""The Break-Up,"" co-starring Vince Vaughn, himself riding a wave of popularity from ""Wedding Crashers."" That success -- $39 million opening weekend and $118 million grossed domestically overall -- was immediately followed by ""Marley & Me,"" which grossed $36 million its first weekend, and ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" which Aniston starred in along with a number of other A-List actors. Yet 2009 brought the flop ""Love Happens,"" which grossed $8 million when it opened in little more than 1,500 theaters in 2009. By all accounts, ""Bounty Hunter,"" beaten by a movie about middle school kids or not, is a step in the right direction. Judging from her ups and downs at the box office, she's been ""far too hit or miss"" to be a safe bet at the box office, Contrino said. ""The moral of the story is that you can't bank on her."" Yet Aniston's public perception would lead one to believe otherwise, said film critic Nick Schager. ""In general, there's a disconnect between Jennifer Aniston's cultural popularity and her movie star popularity,"" Schager said. ""There are certain people -- and you could make the case for Angelina Jolie as well -- given how rampant tabloid culture has become who are much more famous for that stuff than they are for the actual movies or TV shows."" If anything, said US Weekly's Senior Movie Editor Bradley Jacobs, Aniston's cultural popularity is the reason ""Bounty Hunter"" got the dollars that it did, despite its current 8 percent fresh rating on RottenTomatoes.com. ""Despite terrible reviews, people still wanted to go,"" Jacobs said. ""Jennifer is still a movie star."" Aniston is one of the top celebrities that US Weekly covers, Jacobs said, and while her press attention may have something to do with her box office draw, Jacobs doesn't think it's the total sum. ""Jessica Simpson is covered a lot but she doesn't have box office power. Cameron Diaz, we cover her a fair amount and her movies have a spottier track,"" Jacobs said. ""There's something about Jennifer -- they love the hair, the body, the clothes and they've shown that they're willing to pay money."" Aniston, Schager believes, is indeed capable of carrying a movie. She just hasn't shown it yet. ""Aniston hasn't proven herself to be a reliable box office draw on her own, but she is a huge star. I think people like Jennifer Aniston, and if there's a movie that looks appealing, it'll do well,"" Schager said. ""But, she's been a bit overrated in the public conscious because of the extracurricular stuff, and that doesn't necessarily translate to her wanting to see her trade barbs with Gerard Butler."" Which, Schager adds, is really the more pressing point: ""Bounty Hunter"" wasn't great, and not even the brightest star can mask that. ""I think she's chosen poorly for the past few years,"" said Movieline.com senior editor Kyle Buchanan. ""If you look back before that she had 'Marley and Me' and 'The Break Up,' and her indie at that point was 'Friends With Money,' which was a critical success."" ""Bounty Hunter,"" on the other hand, ""seems like a retread of 'The Ugly Truth' from last year. Audiences didn't really care,"" Buchanan said. He added that while ""the amount of hype that we get for Jennifer Aniston is always going to exceed the amount of box office she's going to bring,"" she's still one of the Top 10 actresses. ""She can command an audience, but she has to be in the right vehicle."" The other industry reality to consider, BoxOffice.com's Contrino said, is that none of the A-list actors, save for a few, are consistently opening with huge numbers anymore. ""I think there's a misconception that for a movie to open, it has to have major stars -- nothing could be further from the truth,"" Contrino said. ""If you look at 2009, some of the biggest hits of the year didn't have major names -- with 'The Hangover,' character actors opened the movie based on the concept. It was the same with 'District 9' and 'Paranormal Activity,' which is the golden standard of this argument."" Buchanan agreed that these days, audiences care more about the content than which actor is headlining. ""In the '80s and '90s, there were a dozen stars you could count on to open a movie,"" Buchanan said. ""The days for any actor, male or female, opening a movie based on their name alone are numbered.""",0.72175395,9155
20,"(CNN) -- ""Precious,"" a movie about a 1980s-era Harlem teen who strives to overcome abuse, neglect and illiteracy, pulled five Independent Spirit Award nominations Tuesday morning. Stars Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique were both recognized for their portrayals of a mother and daughter in a dysfunctional relationship, with a best female lead nomination for newcomer Sidibe and a best supporting female nomination for Mo'Nique. The film's success is not entirely a surprise, considering that the Oprah Winfrey- and Tyler Perry-backed Sundance darling has earned $27 million at the domestic box office and was received well by audiences during its slow rollout in cities across the nation in November. Sidibe's work in ""Precious"" has been one of the breakout roles of the year, and the young actress is rumored to be the star of a new series, ""The C Word."" However, it hasn't been all smooth for ""Precious"": The film earned zero nominations for the Gotham Independent Film Awards, which were given out Monday night. The Gotham awards are a New York-based indie film honor. ""The Hurt Locker,"" by contrast, took home two Gotham awards Monday night, one for best picture and the other for best ensemble. There were no Independent Spirit Award nominations for this Iraq war drama, however, as it was nominated last year. For the Spirits, ""Precious"" is facing off against the Zooey Deschanel-driven ""(500) Days of Summer,"" ""Amreeka,"" ""The Last Station"" and ""Sin Nombre"" for best picture. ""Summer"" also snagged a nomination for best male lead, a nod for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On top of the best picture nomination, ""The Last Station"" -- a biographical piece about Leo Tolstoy featuring James McAvoy, Helen Mirren and Paul Giamatti -- is up for best director, best screenplay, best female lead and best supporting male lead. Christian McKay, another relatively unknown actor in the United States, has gotten lots of love from critics for his portrayal of Orson Welles in Richard Linklater's ""Me and Orson Welles,"" and the Spirit Awards noticed, giving the British actor a nomination for best supporting male performer. In order to be considered, all films had to be 70 minutes long with a budget under $20 million, and had to have screened at one of the major film festivals, such as Sundance or Toronto. The awards ceremony is typically held the Saturday before the Academy Awards, but since the Spirit Awards are celebrating their 25th anniversary in 2010, they're moving out from under Oscar's shadow and will air live on the Independent Film Channel on March 5.",0.7215071,8295
21,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The numbers were good for ""Knowing."" In ""Knowing,"" a physics professor (Nicolas Cage) ponders patterns in a list of numbers. The film, about a physics professor who sees clues for disastrous events in a time capsule's list of digits, overcame some pretty long odds at the box office -- going against the Paul Rudd-Jason Segel comedy ""I Love You, Man,"" the Julia Roberts-Clive Owen romantic thriller ""Duplicity"" and some fairly scathing reviews -- to emerge as the weekend's No. 1 film. Though star Nicolas Cage wouldn't have predicted the outcome, in an interview before the film's release, he did talk about the power of positive thinking. ""I'm a huge believer of the human spirit,"" he told CNN. ""I think people are amazing. I think what we have accomplished is incredible. ... If you think positive and you apply the guts and ingenuity that mankind has been doing forever, at least in our existence, I believe we get through anything."" Cage's character, John Koestler, is a science professor whom Cage describes as ""someone who is reawakening to his faith."" He begins the film believing that everything is random, but as the film continues -- and he seeks to alert the world of a coming catastrophe -- ""he believes there is cause and effect and perhaps even a divine mind,"" Cage said. The film begins in 1959, with students burying items in a time capsule at an elementary school. One of the children, however, creates an image of seemingly random numbers. Fifty years later, when the capsule is opened, Koestler's son receives the page of numbers, and his father realizes that they correspond to major disasters of the past half-century. Koestler determines that three events have yet to occur and sets out to meet the clairvoyant child's now grown daughter. The final event threatens life on Earth itself, and the group begins a race against time, with unusual consequences. Critics were not impressed. The film earned a 25 percent rating on the review aggregator RottenTomatoes.com, with some reviewers in full-on mockery mode.  Watch Mr. Moviefone review ""Knowing"" and other films » . ""It's increasingly hard to believe that Cage won an Oscar in 1996 (for 'Leaving Las Vegas'),"" wrote USA Today's Claudia Puig in a 1½-star review. ""In the past decade, he has made some awful choices, and his range has seemed to grow more limited."" ""It's so inept that you may wish you were watching an M. Night Shyamalan version of the very same premise,"" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman, referring to the director whose last two films, ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening,"" were two of the most detested films of recent years. But the film's apocalyptic theme obviously strikes a chord, something director Alex Proyas (""Dark City"") saw early on. Proyas told CNN in a pre-release interview that ""you can read [the film] as biblical if you choose to,"" but he prefers to see it as ""spiritual."" ""I try to leave it very open-ended,"" he said. ""I try to think of it as more a spiritual place than a biblical one."" Cage's character, he said, is on a spiritual quest in the midst of what could be global destruction. Rose Byrne, who plays the clairvoyant child's daughter, Diana, called the film ""kind of a theological discussion."" ""That's always an exciting topic,"" she said. ""It's bridging the gap between science and spirituality. That always makes things thought-provoking, and I like that with any piece of art."" Byrne said that ""Knowing"" taps into some of the end-times anxiety that's been in the air in recent years, which perhaps could help find an audience. (As she was talking before the film's release, she didn't realize how much of an audience.)

""There is a symbolic aspect to what is happening and what the story is about, and to get people to pay attention to what could happen,"" he said. But, he adds, it's also just a movie. ""I believe in the entertainment value of movies -- very much so,"" he said. ""I ... want to make it good for the audience. I really want people to be there and experience something powerful and resident, both in terms of ideas and emotions ... and also with this film trying to do something different. It's a challenging film, and it takes some unexpected turns.""",0.7213988,2864
23,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy ""The Proposal"" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ... Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in ""The Proposal."" Something old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is ""X-Men's"" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. Something new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe. Reynolds, meanwhile, is just refining his dry comedy thing, learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks. Who knew these two would, hmmm, complete each other? Working together, both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods. iReport.com: ""Proposal"" has ""plenty of laughs"" Something borrowed: The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nunez from ""The Office""). The snappy screwball dialogue in Pete Chiarelli's script. And the way Anne Fletcher directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates ... it's all been seen before. For a reason. These elements work.

24,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- It was a night for neon pink bow ties and words like ""disaster"" and ""monstrosity."" It was not the night, however, to be Paris Hilton, Mike Myers or Uwe Boll. Paula Einstein, Rebecca Marcotte and Kelie McIver do a parody of ""Dancing Queen"" to open the show. The 29th Annual Golden Raspberry Awards honored the worst film achievements of the year in a small theater in Hollywood on February 21. The night opened with a parody of the ""Mamma Mia"" song, ""Dancing Queen,"" and ended with ""Love Guru"" being named worst picture. ""It wasn't just the economy that tanked, so did the qualities of the movies being offered,"" Razzie founder John Wilson told CNN several weeks before the show. ""I would suggest putting away all sharp [instruments] before putting the DVDs in your machine."" Paris Hilton and Mike Myers came out on top -- or bottom -- for the awards. Hilton earned both the worst actress and worst supporting actress awards for her roles in ""Hottie & the Nottie"" and ""Repo: The Genetic Opera."" She was also awarded worst screen couple for her on-screen time with her co-stars Christine Lakin and Joel David Moore. Razzie host Gretchen Enders said that ""Hottie & the Nottie"" was ""a vanity production in the worst sense... Hilton, who served as executive producer, has no one to blame but herself."" Hilton's film had a budget of $2 million but only earned about $27,000 at the box office. ""Under Obama's new plan, they wouldn't even have to pay taxes,"" Wilson deadpanned. Myers added worst actor to the ""Love Guru"" worst picture and worst screenplay Razzies. To save anyone else from having to watch it, Wilson shredded a DVD copy of the film on stage. Parody films ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" each nominated in five categories, came away empty-handed. However, that doesn't mean the Razzie foundation thinks they were worthwhile. ""When you invest the kind of money that a mainstream, big-budget star film requires, you want some insurance that your investment is going to come back to you. So... you're going to do what worked before,"" Wilson said. ""Financially that may make sense, but in terms of the audience's enjoyment, surprise or appreciation of what you're doing, it doesn't work."" Enter ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" this year's winner of the worst prequel, remake, rip-off or sequel award. ""A fourth installment of a beloved franchise, but this one found itself loved by almost no one,"" hosts Katsy Chappell and Josh Thoemke said. The approximately 740 voting members of the Raspberry Foundation also found Pierce Brosnan's singing voice sorely lacking. His role in ""Mama Mia"" earned him the worst supporting actor award. ""An actor who could not sing, should not sing and arguably did not sing, in a role he should not have accepted,"" Razzie hosts Chip Dornell and Kelie McIver said about the former James Bond. But perhaps the biggest ""winner"" of the night was Uwe Boll. Recipient of the worst director award, the foundation also recognized his lifetime work with the worst career achievement award. Boll is the ""worst living director on Earth,"" Wilson told CNN. Boll had a sense of humor about his Razzie success. He sent in a video rejection speech from a fake set of Darfur, Sudan, saying the Razzies had ruined his life and he would never be back. The Razzie team is already predicting next year's nominees. A few to watch out for: ""Hannah Montana,"" ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Bride Wars,"" -- the last of which has already grossed more than $50 million. ""It's kind of like watching a train wreck, isn't it?"" Wilson said.",0.720325,3718
25,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When it comes to bagging the best jobs behind the camera, Hollywood A-lister Charlize Theron says that women have to make their own luck. Charlize Theron in ""The Burning Plain,"" which she both stars in and executive produces. Indeed, the 33 year-old's career could be seen as a template for what women can achieve in the industry. As an actress, Theron is famous for roles in films as diverse as serial killer biopic ""Monster"" and Will Smith superhero movie ""Hancock,"" switching with apparent ease between small independent movies and big-budget blockbusters. Theron also represents a small minority of women who work behind the camera in Hollywood. During the 15 years she has worked in the U.S. film industry she has also produced four films. The latest is Guillermo Arriaga's ""The Burning Plain,"" which she both stars in and executive produces. At a time when women are picking up increasingly varied roles in front of the camera, statistics show they are failing to make the same headway behind the scenes. Last year, women made up just 16 percent of all directors, producers, writers and cinematographers who worked on the 250 top grossing films in the U.S. But, says Theron, there is no point in complaining about the tough time women have getting work behind the scenes in the movies. Do you think breaking through through the glass ceiling is still an issue for women in Hollywood?? ""I try not to kind of bitch and complain about what [women] don't have,"" Theron told CNN. ""It's a tricky thing because, I think, if you want to find that lynchpin, you can, in anything. ""I look at the work that I've done and I feel incredibly proud that I've had the chance and the opportunity to work on the material that I have."" Originally born in South Africa, Theron is best-known for her harrowing depiction of prostitute turned serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster."" ""Monster"" was also the first film Theron produced, taking a huge risk on a low-budget project with a script penned by a first-time director -- and with no previous experience of producing herself. Theron saw the film as an opportunity to move away from the lighter roles that are often thrown in the direction of a starlet with looks to spare. ""It's what I've been dying to do with my career,"" she told UK paper The Observer at the time. ""The work I've been doing the last couple of years is not really what I wanted. If you're not careful, you get typecast. I was getting stuck."" She was awarded a Best Actress Oscar for her role in 2004 and ""Monster,"" which was made for just $8 million went on to gross over $60 million worldwide. It is unsurprising, then, that Theron's attitude towards women in Hollywood is one of stand-up-and-be-counted. Although, she says that she will only produce films she feels she can bring something to. ""The things that I've produced have been because I really feel like I can lend some kind of knowledge to making a certain film. ""When I meet a certain director and there's a certain amount of chemistry and we see the same film, and we just kind of feel like we want to set out and make a film together, it just kind of happens."" Like ""Monster"" -- and Theron's other producing credits, Cuban rap documentary ""East of Havana,"" and indie drama ""Sleepwalking"" -- her latest film ""The Burning Plain"" is also by a first-time director. The difference this time is that Arriaga is already a well-established, Oscar-nominated Hollywood screenwriter. The Mexican filmmaker first came to prominence through his close relationship with fellow Mexican Alejandro González Iñárritu. Arriaga wrote the screenplays for ""Amores Perros,"" Oscar-nominated ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams,"" all of which were directed by Iñárritu. Arriaga, famed for his nonlinear narrative style, also wrote the screenplay for ""The Burning Plain,"" a project of such personal resonance for the writer that it was a natural progression for him to also direct the film. Despite Theron's success in bringing Arriaga's vision to the big screen, Theron says she is not ready to move into producing bigger films yet. ""There's no way that I, right now, could produce a massive blockbuster,"" Theron told CNN. ""I just don't feel prepared for that. ""I wouldn't produce something where I didn't feel like I had the skill."" However, Theron feels positive about not only her own position in Hollywood, but also that of her female peers in the industry, such as fellow Oscar winner Kate Winslet. ""I thought Kate Winslet did an amazing job. I do think that it's in our hands to make sure we keep working with the right people who want to go and explore those themes and want to push the envelope and want to tell great female stories.""",0.71401644,8546
26,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In the midst of the ongoing culture wars, can it be a good idea to put out a comedy about two Stone Age men who wander into the Bible? In ""Year One,"" Jack Black stars as an inquisitive Stone Age man, with Michael Cera as his sidekick. Harold Ramis thinks so. ""Year One,"" which he directed, concerns two men -- played by Jack Black and Michael Cera -- who leave their home and, in their travels, meet biblical characters such as Cain, Abel, Abraham and Isaac. Among the locales: ancient Sodom, which ""didn't seem worse than Las Vegas to me,"" Ramis told CNN. ""Year One"" comes out Friday. Ramis, whose writing and directing credits include ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Analyze This,"" said it was time for a new biblical epic -- of sorts. ""No one had done this film for our generation,"" he told CNN. It's like, you know, when 'Animal House' [which Ramis co-wrote] came out, there were college films. Every generation had college films, but our generation didn't have one yet, and I don't know that our generation - this young, new generation of kids has a, you know, a sandal epic yet, and this is the one. This is for them."" Ramis rounded up a cast of comedians familiar to any watcher of Judd Apatow-produced movies -- no surprise, since Apatow is a producer of ""Year One."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse (""Superbad""), Horatio Sanz (""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Step Brothers"") and Bill Hader (""Tropic Thunder"") all have parts. ""A lot of them were new to me,"" said Ramis. ""[But] Jack knew them, Michael knew them, they were connected -- all connected through Judd Apatow, through 'Saturday Night Live' ... the comedy world is a club."" Black joked that everyone's a member of a secret society, requiring retinal scans, that meets ""inside the O of the Hollywood sign -- the first O,"" he noted.. ""All the projects are laid out on a table,"" he said. ""And we talk generally about how we're gonna take over the planet, take over the comedy and keep a vise grip on it."" Black said he revels in the chance to find the humor in the Bible. ""That was the fun of this thing,"" he said. ""It's like, we are going to have some fun with the Bible; you don't see it very often. It hasn't really been done since Monty Python days. 'Life of Brian.' "" However, the film could get more than it asked for. Films poking fun at the Bible -- or, indeed, treating the Bible with anything less than reverence -- have been the subject of protests and criticism. ""Life of Brian,"" the Python troupe's 1979 comedy about an assumed messiah that parodied the story of Jesus, was protested by clergy in the U.S. and banned outright in Ireland. French protesters threw Molotov cocktails into a Paris theater showing ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" Martin Scorsese's 1988 film version of Nikos Kazantzakis' novel. More recently, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" though a huge financial success, was criticized by some observers for alleged anti-Semitism, as well as its violence. Ramis, who observed that a number of biblical films focus on the New Testament, said he deliberately chose to make the Old Testament his subject. ""I told people that I wanted to do for the Old Testament what Monty Python did for the Gospels,"" he said. ""Which is just to kind of take a funny look and project a contemporary sensibility back to these treasured myths of Western civilization. ""It wasn't so much to attack any particular religion,"" he added. ""I figure all religions are good. They all make sense on paper; it's just the exploitation of religion that's been a problem, by ... people using religion to justify war, or to justify government or, you know, 'God made me do it.' "" Ramis said one of his intentions with ""Year One,"" which he co-wrote with ""Office"" writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, was to focus on people, not God. Paraphrasing the liberal clergyman and activist William Sloane Coffin, he said, God's not the event itself, but ""God's in our reaction to the event."" ""I wanted to do a film that kind of addressed these fundamental beliefs and urged people to take personal responsibility, no matter what they believe God is or isn't,"" Ramis said. ""It's still up to us in the final analysis."" Which is not to say that the film skimps on its comedy -- and with Ramis, Black, Cera, Hank Azaria, David Cross and producer Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Superbad"") around, there's no shortage of jokes. ""It's really just a good, dumb, broad comedy,"" Ramis told Entertainment Weekly. Improvisation often played a role, said Cera and Black. ""We weren't locked to anything,"" Cera said. ""It was a very honest set. If something wasn't working then we would address it."" ""We got a lot of different options [from observers], and they were able to play with different options in the editing room. I thought it was a cool way to do it,"" said Black. ""I've never done a movie like that -- and now I wanna do that on all my movies."" iReport.com: Seen ""Year One""? Share your review . The handful of early reviews have been positive, and Ramis is pleased with the result. He's particularly happy the film was received warmly in the Sodom shooting location -- Sibley, located in northwest Louisiana, in the heart of the Bible Belt. ""It's funny, because Southern people living in the heart of the Bible belt, there's a Baptist church every 150 feet in that area, and here we are in Sodom, in the city of Sodom,"" he said. ""And they just got into it, they enjoyed it so much.""",0.7129808,5324
28,"(CNN) -- Comedy is hard; dying is easy. Any stand-up will tell you that. Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen play comedians in ""Funny People."" Let's have a hand, then, for Judd Apatow. Hollywood's most successful contemporary comedy producer isn't resting on his laurels but continues to push toward risky subject matter: male sexual insecurity in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" unwanted pregnancy in ""Knocked Up"" -- and now the big C. No, not cancer -- though Adam Sandler's superstar comedian George Simmons is stricken with an appropriately eccentric form of leukemia. No, this latest film's true subject is Celebrity and the funny things it does to people. Apatow's most personal (and also most self-indulgent) film, ""Funny People,"" shuffles between three competitive Angelino roommates scrambling to grasp a rung on the showbiz ladder (Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, and Jason Schwartzman), Simmons' multimillion-dollar Malibu mansion and the L.A. comedy clubs that sometimes bridge the gap between anonymity and fame. Apatow and Sandler know these worlds well enough. The movie begins, in fact, with old home video footage of young Adam goofing off, making prank phone calls while his roommate Judd sniggers behind the camera. It's one of the few times we see Sandler really having fun and cutting loose. This is mostly a restrained, subdued and admirably unsentimental performance. It feels natural that Simmons -- faced with his dire prognosis -- should return to the comedy circuit to wrestle with his imminent extinction before a roomful of strangers, even as he decides to keep his condition a secret from everyone around him. It's actually not so hard in his case because he doesn't have any real friends, only ""showbiz friends."" The exception is Ira Wright (Rogen), a struggling young comic who lucks into a job as his hero's joke writer slash personal assistant. Simmons is by turns demanding, generous, friendly and abusive, and Ira couldn't be happier. The cross-currents are intriguing: He's getting his first taste of the high life, just as George is trying to savor his last days by reliving his first steps on the circuit. True to form, Apatow negotiates the perilous terrain of existential doubt with his fall-back weapon of choice, the penis joke. Some of these are choice (Ira's real last name is ""Wiener,"" pronounced ""Whiner""), but many, many more feel flabby and redundant. There's even an Andy Dick joke, in the form of Andy Dick himself -- one of several celebrity cameos, the oddest of which is surely Eminem, wondering aloud if George wouldn't be better off dead. We must be approaching the 80-minute mark by then, about the time many comedies start wrapping things up. But it's a question that doesn't seem to have occurred to Simmons or the filmmakers before, and it spurs Apatow on to develop another hour of additional material in which George, miraculously recovered, pursues the love of his life (Leslie Mann), Ira in tow, without much consideration for her two daughters or her husband (Eric Bana). It's as if the movie bred its own sequel. There's plenty of funny stuff here. Bana has a ball as the obtuse Aussie, but despite all the blue jokes, this is a more modulated, pensive effort than Apatow's previous hits. He's improved, a little, as a director (perhaps the credit belongs to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who ensures that for once it doesn't all look like a sitcom), but Apatow is still in dire need of a good editor. His instincts are generous. He wants to give us the six-course meal, and to go around the table, give everybody the chance to tell us a funny story. As a result ""Funny People"" is consistently entertaining but also rather grueling -- as if we're watching two or three different movies at the same time. At least one of these -- the tribulations of the young roomies -- we've seen before, and amusing as these guys are, they properly belong in the deleted scenes category. But Apatow isn't one to kill his babies, that's for sure. He's more likely to write them an additional scene or three. (Mann is Mrs. Apatow, and their two daughters also figure large.) Still, if you're not averse to too much of a good-ish thing, and can stomach another of those terminal Hollywood illnesses that leaves the patient with no discernible ill-effects, ""Funny People"" is a fairly shrewd and nonjudgmental dissection of how celebrity skews and contaminates even the most intimate relationships. The rich and famous aren't the only narcissists in this game, it seems. We're all a bit funny that way. ""Funny People"" is rated R and runs 146 minutes.

29,"(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love. The mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him. Not a good idea for either of them, as it turns out. Halloween is nearly upon us, but ""Antichrist"" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act. The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called ""Vows of Chastity."" It's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, ""Antichrist"" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named. The prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.) Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman. Of course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against ""Hostel,"" ""Saw"" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably. Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse. It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: ""Chaos reigns!"" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch. This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance. Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked ""You get what you pay for, folks"" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end. That unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more. Beautifully shot by Anthony Dod Mantle and acted with raw conviction, ""Antichrist"" is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less. If you don't believe me, go ask the talking fox. ""Antichrist"" is not rated and runs 104 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.",0.7121739,6826
30,"(CNN) -- When a film cast includes names like Ben Stiller, Robin Williams and Owen Wilson, a bit of improvisation on set is to be expected. Ben Stiller and the gang are back in ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian."" ""I think the movie is really only 25 percent scripted, maybe even less than that,"" said Shawn Levy, director of the new film ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,"" which boasts those comedic actors and several others. ""It just so happens that the scenes that get some of the biggest laughs are the improvised scenes, so it feels like more than that, but we had a very good script and it's still very much there."" The sequel to 2006's ""Night at the Museum"" welcomes back the trio and director as well as other original cast members, including British actor Ricky Gervais, while also adding fresh faces such as Hank Azaria (as a villainous pharaoh) and Amy Adams (as Amelia Earhart).  Watch the group laugh about the film » . The new romp features Stiller's character, security guard Larry Daley, in action at the Smithsonian, where some of the pieces from the Museum of Natural History -- the setting for the original movie -- are now being housed. Story writer Robert Ben Garant said watching the actors take the script and run with it was painless. ""It's always hard to watch bad actors improv on your skit,"" Garant said. ""But when it's Ben Stiller and Jonah Hill and Hank, it's such a pleasure because it always starts with the idea of our script and sometimes they stick to the words, but most of the time they do stuff much, much funnier and weirder. It's really great to watch."" Owen Wilson is back as Jedidiah the miniature cowboy, who is now being held hostage at the Smithsonian. Azaria turns up the mean as Kahmunrah, the bitter brother of the pharaoh from the last film. Azaria said he thoroughly enjoyed his turn as the film's resident bad guy. ""When the villain is this ridiculous, it's fun,"" Azaria said. ""When he actually has a sense of humor and self-awareness, and goes from frivolous to really mean bully."" ""In the end I had to be forced to do the mean stuff because I always wanted to do the silly stuff,"" he added. ""But watching it ... I enjoyed the mean stuff the most. "" Even with the good times on set, filming at the iconic Smithsonian was a monumental task, given that it wasn't always closed while the actors worked. Stiller said the crowds who watched the movie making magic were respectful and quiet during filming, often breaking into applause after a scene. ""We weren't really doing much, it was just the best audience in the world,"" he said. ""So it was sort of like doing a live show at the Smithsonian."" Funny man Stiller even got to monkey around on set -- literally. In this film, there were two simians that took on the actor in a scene that found him getting the short end of the branch. ""I basically get slapped by both of them, but I am not allowed to slap them back because of animal rights, so I have to slap a dummy or a tennis ball when they're off-screen,"" Stiller told the British newspaper, The Mirror. ""It's a weird experience."" Robin Williams, who is recovering from heart surgery, said he was excited to return as Theodore Roosevelt -- this time with a twist. ""I got to play two versions of Teddy Roosevelt,"" Williams said. ""One, the Teddy that was in the first movie and the other was kind of a brassy, bitchy Teddy and the one that's a bust of Teddy Roosevelt."" With so many comics on board, it can't help but be a zany ride. Wilson said he believes those good times will translate to the audience. ""Shawn was really great about kind of letting people try things,"" he said. ""So it just had that kind of spirit on it where everybody was having a good time. I think you kind of feel it when watching the movie."" Director Levy said the actors weren't the only ones who had fun. It's not every day a crew has access to the secret life of a museum, especially the Smithsonian, and Levy immersed himself in the privilege. ""It's such a fun world to explore, it's so dynamic, and the possibilities are literally endless,"" he said. ""I just love telling these stories."" Since filming was such a blast, might there be a ""Night at the Museum 3"" in the works? ""Ask me after Memorial Day,"" Levy said, laughing.",0.71188676,4975

A few facts are well established: Christian Bale was born January 30, 1974, in Wales. His father, a former RAF pilot, once served as a film double for John Wayne; his mother was a one-time circus performer. (After divorcing his mother, Bale's father later married women's-rights advocate Gloria Steinem.) The family moved often, with Bale estimating he lived in 15 different places in his first 15 years. He started his acting career while still a child. He received his first acting break appearing opposite Rowan Atkinson (""Mr. Bean"") in the London stage show ""The Nerd"" in 1984, followed by two British TV miniseries. At 12 he was plucked from 4,000 hopefuls to star in Steven Spielberg's 1987 film ""Empire of the Sun."" (According to the Times of London, he was recommended by Spielberg's then wife, Amy Irving.) Even then he disliked dealing with the press: he abruptly walked out of a Paris press conference for ""Empire"" while promoting the film. ""Empire"" was followed by an eclectic filmography: Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare adaptation ""Henry V"" (1989); the musical ""Newsies"" (1992); the historical drama ""Swing Kids"" (1993); and the 1994 version of ""Little Women,"" which made him a sex symbol to a group of ""Baleheads."" (He was one of the first stars to have a fan site devoted to him.) Through the latter, he also met his future wife, Sandra Blazic, a onetime assistant to ""Little Women"" star Winona Ryder. The two have been married for eight years, and have a 3-year-old daughter. By the late '90s, he was acting in a number of independent films, including ""Metroland"" (1997), based on a Julian Barnes novel about London yuppies; ""Velvet Goldmine"" (1998), the Todd Haynes film that starred Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as early-'70s rockers; and, most infamously, ""American Psycho"" (2000), based on the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel about a vicious serial killer who hides behind a bland investment banker persona. iReport.com: Your thoughts on 'Dark Knight' Bale has said he was more affected by trying to get the ""Psycho"" part than the role itself. He was strung along -- the studio wanted Leonardo DiCaprio, who was slated for it but walked after contract negotiations broke down -- and put a number of projects on hold while hoping the role would come through. But making the movie, which was given an NC-17 rating by the ratings board for its (often implied) violence and sex -- was fairly easy, he told Entertainment Weekly in 2000. ""I can't say I felt queasy once making this movie. ... I slept really well,"" he told the magazine. ""I played Jesus in this TV thing [NBC's 'Mary, Mother of Jesus'] after doing 'American Psycho' -- I had nightmares the whole time, like I haven't had since I was 10 years old. ... But ['Psycho' character] Patrick Bateman? Nothing."" Since ""American Psycho,"" Bale has become as known for his work ethic as his performances. He dropped 60 pounds for ""The Machinist,"" about a blue-collar worker afflicted with insomnia, and then bulked up again for ""Batman Begins,"" his first go-round at the Batman role. He played a disturbed military veteran in ""Harsh Times"" (2006), investing the role with such intensity that he shocked director David Ayer, and ate worms in ""Rescue Dawn,"" which he made for the equally intense director Werner Herzog. He changes his natural English accent for each role, to the extent of doing publicity in his character's voice. He's said on many occasions that he tries many roles for ""the experience."" But it's ""The Dark Knight"" that has everybody buzzing. In interviews for the movie, Bale has been eager to shine the spotlight on his fellow cast members, notably the late Heath Ledger and co-star Michael Caine, and even his stunt double.  Watch Bale talk about the film and Ledger » . But director Christopher Nolan -- who's now directed Bale in three films (the two Batmans and ""The Prestige"") -- says the actor deserves praise in his own right. ""I knew I wanted to work with him when I saw him in 'American Psycho,' "" he told USA Today. ""You have to be extremely talented to take that kind of absurd violence and make it funny. That's what I wanted for Batman, too."" With ""The Dark Knight"" earning raves and raking in money, Bale would seem to have his pick of future roles. He loves working with Nolan -- he's intimated that he'd sign on for ""Batman 3"" if Nolan's on board -- and doesn't seem to care if the role is for a small-scale indie or a big-budget summer blockbuster. But give people a bigger glimpse of Christian Bale? That's not going to happen if he can help it. Indeed, he takes pride in his anonymity. He told Details of two incidents -- one in which an agent didn't recognize him, another with a casting director who confused him with Christian Slater -- that encouraged him, and told the Los Angeles Times he will continue to make things up to entertain himself during endless movie junkets: ""I have no desire for people to get their facts right about me,"" he said. What finally matters, he told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune while promoting ""The Prestige"" (a film in which he convincingly played a magician), is the work. Acting, he pointed out, has its blessings. ""We're fortunate that it's easy for us to disappear inside our characters,"" he said.",0.71140504,6776
32,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Spike Lee's last film, the gratifyingly tense and tricky ""Inside Man,"" was celebrated -- rightly -- for the way that Lee finally jumped, feet first, into the studio-genre-movie game. Director Spike Lee poses for a shot during the filming of ""Miracle at St. Anna"" in Rome, Italy. He cooked up a gourmet-popcorn heist thriller and stamped every moment with his personality. Lee, until now, has never made a movie -- good or bad -- that wasn't unmistakably his. His latest, ""Miracle at St. Anna,"" is the first Hollywood feature to tell the story of the African-American soldiers who fought in the U.S. armed forces during World War II , and as such it's a movie with a monumental mission. Unfortunately, that's more or less the only monumental thing about it. ""Miracle"" isn't powerful, it's muddled and diffuse, and the disappointment of the film begins with what a hard time I had finding Spike Lee in it. Based on a 2002 novel by James McBride, who also wrote the screenplay, the movie has a drifting, scattershot structure and no real organizing tone or style (if you wondered what Lee's frozen-figure-on-receding-background shots might look like in a wartime setting, then keep wondering). The bizarrely contrived framing device is set in the 1980s, when a postal worker named Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) mutters in anger at an old John Wayne war flick on TV, then shoots and kills a man who shows up to buy stamps. (He surely has his reasons, but does he really get away with stashing a loaded Luger under his post-office window each day?)  Watch Spike Lee talk about the film » . After his arrest, Hector won't talk, but a reporter finds a clue in the form of a priceless artifact hidden in his apartment: the head of a statue that once adorned a bridge in Florence that was wrecked by bombs during World War II. From this labored and gimmicky setup, the film flashes back to the itch and fear of battle, as Hector, along with other members of the all-black 92nd Infantry Division and its ''Buffalo Soldiers,'' stalks the Tuscan countryside. It's September 1944, and as they try to cross the Serchio River, the men are ambushed. The sequence has thunderous explosions, jittery editing, blown-up bodies -- everything but the virtuosity of staging that might have made the chaos and carnage revelatory instead of just a Saving Private Ryan rehash. Four members of the division end up stranded behind enemy lines, all but abandoned by a racist commander. In addition to Negron, there's Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), a college-educated stoic devoted to his service; Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy), furious at the world and a loose cannon, with no loyalty to the country he's fighting for; and Pvt. Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller), a starry-eyed oversize simpleton who rescues, and befriends, an Italian urchin (Matteo Sciabordi). The dramatic focal point, if you can call it that, is the war of wills between Stamps and Cummings. These two play out a version of the assimilate-versus-agitate debate that has echoed through many decades of African- American life, though this one would be more convincing if Ealy, a dynamic actor, had been asked to project his anger more in period, with a little less proto-gangsta recklessness. The men arrive at a picturesque village, where they mingle with the locals and Stamps and Cummings stoke their rivalry over Renata (Valentina Cervi), a married woman who is lovely in a saintly way. The film then veers into an endless, murky subplot about the Italian resistance from which it never recovers. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" wants to do too many things at once to do any of them with much verve. It aspires to be a war epic, but it's dominated less by combat than by flat, meandering talk. It wants to salute the flesh-and-blood valor of the Buffalo Soldiers, but these unsung heroes are treated as such impersonally symbolic and stiff-jointed types that their heroism shines only faintly. The movie tries to be raw and real, yet it isn't above trotting out a tyke who might have stepped out of Cinema Paradiso II to tag along with the soldiers as a mascot of sentiment. There are vile Nazis on hand -- and also a nice Nazi who does a really good deed. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" winds up as a pastiche of racial-historical correction, showboat atrocity, murder mystery, love story, and windy meditation. Is it any wonder that it's less than the sum of its ambitious parts? As odd as it may sound to say about a war film, though, the real trouble with ""Miracle"" is that Lee's filmmaking is joyless.

33,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Usually, when characters in a movie are one-dimensional, that's not a good thing. But in ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,"" the waxworks figures who come to life after sundown aren't crassly sketchy or dramatically lacking. They're one-dimensional, all right, but knowingly, delightfully so. Ben Stiller and Amy Adams size up a bobble-head Albert Einstein in the ""Night at the Museum"" sequel. Even at their most pop-up brash, they're true to the way that kids see history. They're like characters out of a cool yet innocent mischief-at-midnight children's book -- a ""Where the Wild Things Are"" of global story-time kitsch. And they give you a lift. The movie, make no mistake, is clownishly silly, a lark as light as balsa wood. If anything, though, it's a faster, wittier spin on the formula of its predecessor. Released in 2006, ""Night at the Museum"" was a family popcorn extravaganza that touched a chord even its producers may not have anticipated. In the sequel, Ben Stiller, as the former night guard Larry Daley (he's now a successful entrepreneur ... of flashlights!), spends one long night infiltrating the galleries of the Smithsonian Institution, where he attempts to rescue the exhibits he first got to know at the American Museum of Natural History. (He's trying to get his hands on the magical Egyptian tablet that brings them to life.) The T.rex, the capuchin monkeys, Attila the Hun -- all have been shipped to the archives of the Smithsonian. And all are as feisty as ever. But ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" tilts away from the zoological. The film is a history-of-the-world burlesque in which such drolly self-centered icons as General Custer (Bill Hader), Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest), and Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) -- a made-up pharoah who lisps with the enthusiasm of Boris Karloff on his own reality show -- collide happily with a living army of Albert Einstein bobblehead dolls, plus stone-carved angels who sing ""More Than a Woman"" and ""The Thinker"" come to life as a Brooklyn deadbeat. This is what you call a wholesome kiddie movie on drugs. It all works because Stiller, with his eager-to-please anxiety and his incredulous double takes, is the perfect addled straight man for a hellzapoppin history show. And it works because Amy Adams, as Amelia Earhart, has the breathless, daffy-sexy vivacity of a '30s screwball heroine, her eyes lit with fire, her delivery as sharp as cut glass as she rat-a-tats out lines like ""You haven't been able to take your cheaters off my chassis since we met!"" ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" has plenty of life. But it's Adams who gives it zing. EW Grade: B+ . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

34,"(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama ""Antichrist."" The mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him. Not a good idea for either of them, as it turns out. Halloween is nearly upon us, but ""Antichrist"" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act. The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called ""Vows of Chastity."" It's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, ""Antichrist"" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named. The prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.) Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman. Of course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against ""Hostel,"" ""Saw"" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably. Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse. It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: ""Chaos reigns!"" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch. This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance. Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked ""You get what you pay for, folks"" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end. That unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more. Beautifully shot by Anthony Dod Mantle and acted with raw conviction, ""Antichrist"" is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less. If you don't believe me, go ask the talking fox. ""Antichrist"" is not rated and runs 104 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.",0.7100904,8304
36,"(CNN)  -- Is the movie cop thriller heading for retirement? Colin Farrell, left, and Edward Norton star in ""Pride and Glory"" as New York cops. It seems incredible to suggest that such a popular form of storytelling might be on the way out, but it's happened before: Musicals and westerns were once staple entertainment for the moviegoing masses, and somewhere in the 1970s they just went thataway. Now the musicals and westerns that emerge are considered unusual. So consider: Last week the top box-office draw in the country was ""Max Payne"" with Mark Wahlberg as an obsessed cop tracking down the killer who murdered his wife and child. Based on a video game, ""Max Payne"" takes a rudimentary plot and boils it down still further, to the point where it's worse than predictable. The film's attraction (such as it is) isn't found in story, but in decoration: the blue-filtered chiaroscuro and etch-y comic book compositions, how the snow glints under the streetlights. ""Pride and Glory,"" on the other hand, is resolutely old school. Not only is it not based on a video game, it's hard to imagine that any of the characters has played one -- or seen a movie either.  Watch behind the scenes at ""Pride and Glory"" » . The time period isn't specified, but it seems to be today, going on 1974. Written by ""Tumbleweeds"" director Gavin O'Connor and Joe Carnahan (""Narc""), based on a story O'Connor put together with his twin brother Greg and ex-New York cop Robert Hopes, this is one of those movies that wants to emulate the serious side of '70s cinema, to dig into thorny ethical quandaries and alert us to institutional corruption. Unfortunately, it does a poor job. This time Edward Norton is the alienated cop, Ray Tierney. Like Max Payne, he's stepped away from the street to nurse his own grievances -- he bears an ugly scar down his cheek from an incident referred to only obliquely. The details remain hazy, but it casts a ""Chinatown""-size cloud over Ray and probably accounts for the state of his marriage -- which is over -- and the fact that he's sleeping on his dad's leaky sailboat. There's considerably more plot in ""Pride and Glory"" than in ""Max Payne,"" but it's only marginally less predictable. A shooting puts four cops down -- all of them from the command of Ray's brother Francis (Noah Emmerich). Francis is devastated, and the boys' father, Francis Sr. (Jon Voight), insists Ray must step up and take charge of the investigation. The Tierney clan has another cop in the family: Jimmy (Colin Farrell) is married to their sister (Lake Bell). We soon realize Jimmy's hands are dirty. But what will Ray do about it? If you've seen your Sidney Lumet movies -- ""Serpico,"" ""Prince of the City,"" ""Q&A"" -- then you'll be well ahead of the game. Even if you haven't, you'll have seen the cop shows that drew from them. Which is why almost every scene, every line of dialogue in ""Pride and Glory"" has the dull thud of cliche. ""We can't keep doing this,"" moans Ray's soon-to-be ex-wife. Any regular moviegoer will know exactly what she means: How many more times will we have to suffer this déja-vu? Granted, originality isn't everything. Last year, James Grey's ""We Own the Night"" invested a very similar story with subtle character shadings and a subversive edge. What's most disappointing about O'Connor's capably acted but gloomy and portentous movie is how it shies away from any real complexity. The Tierneys may have their faults, but the outsider, Jimmy, is the bad egg (we gather that much when he threatens a baby with a hot iron). When push comes to shove, the brothers do the right thing in a climax so stock you could use it to make gravy. The old school was better than this. And, back then, it wasn't old either. ""Pride and Glory"" is rated R and runs 129 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.",0.709821,3692
37,"(CNN) -- The Academy-Award winning British producer and (briefly) Columbia Pictures head David Puttnam used to have a placard on the wall of his office. It read: ""Hello, he lied."" In ""The Invention of Lying,"" Ricky Gervais plays a ""loser"" in a society that tells only the truth. Lies are second nature in Hollywood, or maybe even first nature, so it's not surprising that the breathtakingly simple but bewilderingly original idea underpinning the new movie from ""The Office"" creator Ricky Gervais came from an industry neophyte, Gervais's co-writer and co-director, Matthew Robinson. The idea? In a world in which everyone always speaks the truth -- in which no one has ever so much as considered deceit, flattery, hyperbole, hiring an illegal maid or under-declaring their taxable returns -- what status, fame and fortune would fall to the first man to realize the power of fabrication? Appropriately, Gervais' character, Mark Bellison, works in the film biz as a screenwriter. But this being a society in which fiction has yet to be invented, his job consists of penning historical lectures that will then be read aloud to the moviegoing public by the on-screen narrator. Mark has drawn the short straw with the 14th century (no one wants to hear about the Black Death), and he's about to be fired, as his secretary (Tina Fey) is eager to tell him. She's never liked him anyway; she tells him that, too. An honest world can be a brutal place for a short, fat loser, which is all that Mark is. After all, everybody says so. The movie never surpasses the gleeful hilarity of the first 25 minutes, when it allows us to imagine just how crushing and soulless this nakedly Darwinian universe would be. The high point comes early, with Mark's dispiriting blind date with the beautiful Anna (Jennifer Garner), who is scrupulously frank about her first impressions and his long-term prospects, which are nil. She's searching for a fiscally well-endowed, genetically attractive mate, and Mark ain't him.  Watch Gervais explain why Garner came cheap » . Gervais has made similar, self-deprecating remarks about the chances of a chubby Brit like him making it in Hollywood -- a line he repeated at the Emmys recently -- though it must be said, so far, Hollywood seems to be welcoming him with open arms. ""The Invention of Lying"" is loaded with celebrity cameos from the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton and Christopher Guest. Gervais should relax: Clowns don't have to be Cary Grant. Funny-looking is fine for a funny man. Meanwhile Mark's obsession with the unfairness of it all smacks of self-pity. It doesn't seem to have occurred to the filmmakers that his attraction to Anna is based entirely on her looks. Garner's role cries out for grace notes -- a kind word, a quip, an insight, some flash of warmth -- Garner can only hint at. Provocatively, the big lie that changes everything is the promise of an afterlife Mark gives to his mother on her deathbed. The word soon gets out, and Mark is forced to spell out the tenets of the world's first religion, as dictated to him by ""the man in the sky."" Or so he says, and who should doubt it? You have to admire the audacity of such sacrilegious mischief-making, but truth be told, the movie loses its way the longer Gervais spins out this anti-parable. His false prophet acquires fame and fortune but still struggles to convince the girl that he's a better bet than Rob Lowe in the genes department. The ending's uncertain mixture of cynicism and sentimentality doesn't feel entirely plausible, and between them, Gervais and Robinson can't smooth over the story's bumpy patches. At times, the energy just seeps out of the film. But that doesn't mean ""The Invention of Lying"" isn't the funniest movie around right now. At its best, it's inspired. It's just that Ricky Gervais still has a ways to go before his filmmaking reaches the sustained pitch of his TV work. It should be fun seeing him figure it out. ""The Invention of Lying"" is rated PG-13 and runs 100 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.",0.7090913,7666

He says ""Entourage"" would make a great film. Of course, the popular actor can do much more than that to captivate audiences. From drama to comedy, Piven has starred in more than 40 films on the big screen and has won critical acclaim for his role as super agent Ari Gold on HBO's ""Entourage."" (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) Piven stopped by the CNN.com newsroom to talk with CNN's Nicole Lapin about his new film, ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,"" in which he plays a used car salesman. The following is an edited version of the interview: . CNN: [The movie] was hysterical, and my producer and I were sitting next to each other and we were trying to figure out -- is this like lowbrow, but it's smart, so it's medium-brow? Highbrow comedy? Jeremy Piven: It's a hybrid-brow, or a unibrow. It's from the people who brought you ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers"" and ""Anchorman,"" so from the kings of guys who make really smart, low-brow comedies, and I'm just insanely honored to be a part of it. It's like a dream because my fear was that by the time Will [Ferrell] hit the screen that, worst-case scenario, the movie wouldn't be funny enough. So that when Will jumps out of the plane, he takes us to a whole other level -- it's like, ""Oh my God, Will Ferrell is so brilliant."" But the reality is, the movie was so funny up until that moment that it was really, it was kind of organic, and it sustained it and it was really fantastic.  Watch why part of Piven's interview had to be bleeped out » . James Brolin would go home to his wife, Barbra Streisand, at night, and I would say, ""James, is she OK with all this?"" Because he has one of the most twisted roles you've ever seen, as you know -- and I don't want to give it away. He was like, ""Well, the wife is on the fence about this whole thing,"" and she came to a screening and I swear to God, Babs laughed the loudest. CNN: I think that's a tease in itself. That would probably get people to see it. Piven: Yes, I think you're right. The movie is OK'd by Barbra Streisand; she vetted the whole thing. If you would have told me, I would be doing a lead in a movie, and Will Ferrell would have a smaller role in it, I never would have believed you, but I'm here to tell you anything is possible. CNN: Anything is possible, even in some 40 some movies in your career, but this is the first lead in a while, I mean did it take you a while to get into the used car salesman character? Piven: There's a great documentary called ""Slasher"" about car salesmen that I took a look at, and I went to a bunch of lots, and I've also been sold a lot of cars, and I'm what's known as a sucker. As soon as they see me coming in, they know they're going to take my money. So I kind of took that, and I reversed it and I'm no longer a sucker. CNN: Are you going to stick with ""Entourage""? Piven: Well, I think ""Entourage"" ... this season is the sixth season, and it's I think the most interesting of all of them, and I kind of have the best arc this year. The backstage life of Hollywood is such fertile stuff for our show that I think we could continue on for as long as it stays fresh. CNN: What about a movie?

39,"(CNN) -- We all have our favorites for the big honors at Hollywood's top awards show, but over its 80-year history there have been some classic films, performers and people behind the scenes that have been criminally overlooked by Oscar. Peter Sellers in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" just one of Kubrick's classics beaten to the prize by a glitzy musical . From acting turns that kept us glued to the screen, to directors that were passed over by the Academy time and time again, these are the statues we would have given out if we'd been in charge. Don't agree? Think we've missed one or robbed an actual winner of its top-spot? Share your views by using the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best. 1. Stanley Kubrick's double snub 1968/1964 . In two equally baffling instances, the last true auteur's work was denied the prize. Cold War classic ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" lost out to George Cukor's ""My Fair Lady"" while his genre-defining sci-fi epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was beaten by Carol Reed's threadbare ""Oliver!"" Glossy Hollywood musicals hailed above two of the most influential movies ever made: are you serious? Truly, this is Oscar's greatest travesty. 2. ""Citizen Kane,"" denied best picture 1941 . It has been topping critics' lists since its release over 60 years ago, but this work of cinematic genius left the 1941 Oscars almost empty handed. Nominated for nine, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, ""Citizen Kane"" was beaten to the prize by ""How Green Was My Valley,"" a sentimental epic about Welsh miners. 3. Martin Scorsese, ever the bridesmaid 1976/1980/1990 . Finally recognized last year for his work on ""The Departed,"" for years it looked like Scorsese would always play bridesmaid to some distinctly mediocre brides. The three biggest Oscar crimes against Marty: ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas."" For the latter, he was beaten by Kevin Costner for ""Dances With Wolves."" Fair enough, it's the only Costner-helmed film that isn't utterly abysmal, but better than Scorsese's best? We don't think so. 4. James Dean: Rebel without an Oscar 1955/1956 . The only actor to receive more than one posthumous nomination, Dean still failed to secure the statue, despite turning in three amazing performances in one year. Nominated for his roles in ""East of Eden"" and ""Giant,"" and overlooked for the iconic ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" three performances that put him into Hollywood folklore as an acting great, he lost out second time round to Yul Brynner in ""The King and I."" Is it us or are the sentimental musicals trumping the all-time classics? 5. Alfred Hitchcock's Academy curse 1958 . One of the greatest directors of all time, Hitchcock never won the best director award. Nominated just four times, he was only beaten by the finest directors of the day, including Billy Wilder and Elia Kazan. But how could the nomination committee overlook ""Vertigo""? Today it's considered one of his true masterpieces. No nomination for Hitchcock, and instead the academy hand the award to Vincente Minnelli, the director of ""Gigi"" -- another tooth-gratingly glitzy musical. 6. ""Pulp Fiction"" and Morgan Freeman get Gump-ed 1994 . Whether you like ""Forrest Gump"" or not, it's hard to defend the decision that saw Tom Hanks take his second acting Oscar ahead of the definitive performance of one of Hollywood's elder statesmen, Morgan Freeman, in Frank Darabont's ""Shawshank Redemption."" And as for the Academy passing over ""Pulp Fiction"" or its director, Quentin Tarantino in favor of a comfortable family flick? That left us speechless. Where's the Academy's court of appeal? 7. Robert Duvall steals the show, but is robbed of the award 1979 . It's hard to stand out in a cast that has Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper in it, let alone when the project's directed with powerful skill by Francis Ford Coppola, but the wild ravings of Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore stand out as the highlight in the excellent and affecting ""Apocalypse Now."" We hate the smell of Oscar injustice in the morning. 8. ""LA Confidential"" is sunk by a blockbuster 1997 . Ok, it was an impressive venture, and the technical frills were unrivalled at the time, but ""Titanic"" just wasn't the best film of the year. A flimsy script, plus performances far from the actors' best, failed to deter voters: the movie picked up a record 11 awards. Versus ""LA Confidential,"" or even the impressive ""Good Will Hunting,"" it simply doesn't float. 9. Al Pacino's best apparently not good enough 1976 . Pacino may have descended into a constant stream of shouting in his later roles (something that can be seen in abundance in ""Any Given Sunday"" or ""Devil's Advocate""), but his magnetic performance as sensitive Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"" sees him at his compelling best. Joel Grey's performance in ""Cabaret"" (more musicals! Argh!) is nothing if not annoying, and certainly not a patch on Pacino's finest hour. 10. ""Brokeback Mountain"" wins everything but an Oscar 2005 . In the approach to the Academy Awards it had been winning major prizes, scooping the best picture BAFTA and Golden Globe and earning director Ang Lee a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, but when it came to the Oscars, the movie mysteriously missed out. ""Crash,"" the actual winner, is not a bad film, but it pales in comparison to the sensitive and highly emotional ""Brokeback Mountain."" .................................... Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Read others' comments and share your views by using the Sound Off box below. ....................... And the day before the Oscars are given out, the 28th Annual Razzie Awards will be announced for the year's worst film offerings. Here are five of the biggest Razzie winners ... Sly and the family Stallone ""win"" big . With 30 nominations and 10 awards, including worst actor of the century, Sly is the biggest ""winner"" in Razzie history. Most notably, in 1985 he and his family cleaned up, as he took worst actor, director and screenplay awards, his wife Brigitte Nielsen scooped worst supporting actress and worst new star, and Sly's brother Frank received worst original song for ""Peace in Our Time"" from ""Rambo II."" Their parents must be so proud. Madonna fails to get the hint . She's not known for her acting, but Madge just won't let it go. With fewer than 20 full-length feature roles under her belt, the queen of pop has picked up 15 Razzie nominations and nine awards for her weak performances. In 2002 she cleaned up, taking Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actress and half of the Worst Couple. You really can't fault her consistency. ""Showgirls"" breaks Razzie records . This record-breaking clunker was nominated for 13 awards in 1995: admirable, since there were only 10 categories that year. It also claimed the most wins, taking home a well-deserved seven awards, including Worst Director and Worst Picture, which were collected in person by director Paul Verhoeven, the first winner to attend the show to collect Razzies. Respect. Eddie Murphy: man of 2008 . This year's show sees the comedian who was up for an Oscar last year pick up a record five nominations for one person in a year, for his work in Worst Picture nominee ""Norbit."" Having played multiple characters, Murphy is up for Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst Supporting Actress, Worst Couple (nominated with himself) and Worst Screenplay. A truly impressive haul: good work, Eddie. Battlefield Earth ""succeeds"" in every category . John Travolta's Scientology/sci-fi movie was nominated for a meager eight awards, but brought home the bacon as it took seven of those awards on the night. Only Forrest Whitaker failed to convert his nomination, pipped to the post by co-star Barry Pepper. If it makes them feel any better, we think they deserved all eight. .................................... Don't agree? Think we've missed one?

40,"(CNN) -- Actor Michael Jai White thinks the negative connotation surrounding the term ""blaxploitation film"" is a bunch of jive. Michael Jai White stars in the new spoof ""Black Dynamite."" ""The problem I have with the word is that it seems to encompass movies that don't fall under that category,"" White said. ""As soon as you hear the title 'Shaft' people think 'blaxploitation' and that is absolutely unfair because that film was made before the term even existed."" White, the star and co-writer of the new movie ""Black Dynamite,"" would rather people focus on what he views as the positives of the genre of 1970s urban action films starring African-American actors. His new movie, which opened in limited release last weekend and will start going wider, follows the exploits of Black Dynamite, a former CIA agent who takes to the streets after his brother is killed by the mafia, orphanages are flooded with drugs and some bad malt liquor finds its way into the 'hood. It is both a spoof of, and homage to, the genre whose films like ""Black Caesar,"" ""The Mac,"" ""Foxy Brown,"" and ""Superfly"" have developed a cult following over the years. ""Black Dynamite"" caught the eye of Sony Pictures at the Sundance Film Festival and the studio acquired the rights to distribute the film. A viral marketing campaign helped whip up anticipation for the movie, which also features former late-night talk show host Arsenio Hall and ""In Living Color"" cast member Tommy Davidson as pimps. Director Scott Sanders said he has always been fascinated by the fact that while blaxploitation really only grabbed hold of the industry for about five years during the early 1970s, it was so influential. ""It was such an extreme genre with the look and the music and there were really no boundaries or rules,"" he said. ""It's always been a fascination for me given how much it influenced hip-hop, black culture and culture as a whole, given the brevity."" White, best known for his roles in the films ""Spawn"" and Tyler Perry's ""Why Did I Get Married,"" said he is a huge fan of blaxploitation films and views his movie as a loving send-up. While he is aware that some of the films were unintentionally funny with their low-budget gaffes -- such as the appearance of mic booms in some scenes -- and their stereotypes, White said the genre is a valued part of the movie industry's history. ""These movies really saved Hollywood because the studio system was in trouble and they learned that they had a cash cow with these films,"" he said. ""Later they exploited it by making any movie and throwing the term 'black' in front of it and that's what made it exploitive."" They also gave African-American actors a chance to work and reflected a people's pride following the gains of the civil rights era. Laurence Washington, managing editor and co-publisher of Blackflix.com, said the movies helped young, black fans like him realize that ""when we grow up we don't have to be train porters, busboys and waiters."" The films instead portrayed handsome, brave and suave black heroes who always got the girl, Washington said. ""When the blaxploitation films came out in the '70s, black audiences had never had action film heroes they could identify with,"" he said. ""[The movies] also opened the door for today's black actors and directors to enter the mainstream."" Darius James, author of ""That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury),"" said blaxploitation films were like any other film that appeal to a specific audience, such as the indie movies of Roger Corman and Russ Meyer. James said he grew up seeing civil rights workers beaten and hosed on television and the movies came out time when there was a sense of defiance and resistance against the marginalization of African-Americans. ""These films, black exploitation films, reflected that spirit,"" James said. White said he wishes there were more action films starring black actors these days. The films of the past were fearless and about true emotion, he said. ""The 'black is beautiful' movement had taken off and there was so much pride,"" White said. ""When they called each other 'brother' they meant it."" ""The heroes were strong, sexy and they kicked ass."" ""I ask 'Where is that now?' I would like people to look at our film and say: 'Where are the black actors like that now?' "" Jay Potts, the cartoonist behind World of Hurt -- which bills itself as ""The Internet's #1 Blaxploitation Webcomic"" -- said he hopes ""Black Dynamite"" furthers interest in the genre. And while ""blaxploitation"" is a convenient moniker to lump in films that may not have always had the best production value, Potts said they were a testament to an era. ""The films came out at a time when black people were learning about themselves and flexing their creative muscles,"" Potts said. ""To me, there was a lot of fun, had a lot of energy and while it always wasn't perfect by any means there was so much life in it that I hope people take another look.""",0.7072788,7232
41,"(CNN) -- Call it the second coming. Jennifer Connelly and Keanu Reeves star in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Klaatu the spaceman first visited these parts in Robert Wise's 1951 Cold War classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" when he threatened to blow us all up unless we stopped threatening to do the job for him. Klaatu wasn't exactly greeted with open arms back then -- he was shot and hounded for his troubles -- and if the earth has moved on over the past half century, you wouldn't know it from the trigger-happy welcoming committee that surrounds his luminous snowball of a space craft in New York's Central Park. Where sci-fi films in the 1950s used to see red(s), today they go green. Directed by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") and scripted by David Scarpa (""The Last Castle""), ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" 2.0 ditches the Cold War theme. Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) means to save the planet, but war isn't the problem. Mankind is the problem. The filmmakers have come up with an effective Spielbergian prologue, cutting from the Himalayas in 1928 to contemporary biology professor Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), whisked from her home by uniformed men in response to an undisclosed national emergency. It's strange to think that in the final hour the government will turn to molecular biologists for guidance, though true to form (as in the 1951 original) the scientists are quickly overruled by the politicians. But once Keanu-Klaatu emerges from his blubbery placenta spacesuit, the movie shifts into familiar fugitive thriller terrain and the tension slowly drains out of it. Dr. Benson helps him escape to New Jersey where he can meet with an alien undercover agent in McDonald's, and she can introduce him to a true world leader, a Nobel laureate played by John Cleese. If you're going to cast a top star as an alien being, Reeves seems a solid choice. He's always been able to process human emotion with a Spock-like detachment. ""This body is going to take some getting used to,"" Klaatu cautions shakily in his first scene, but in fact he gets the walking-talking thing down pat in no time. He's a messianic figure -- he fires lasers out of his wrists, like a reverse-stigmata and he has the power to resurrect the dead (though unlike Jesus, Klaatu killed the guy in the first place). The climax even includes a plague of robotic locusts. But the movie never comes up with a convincing explanation for why his superpowers don't extend to, say, picking up a telephone. Apparently the aliens have been monitoring us for at least 70 years, but Klaatu is taken aback to discover our emotional side. Mostly he learns this from Jaden Smith, who plays Dr. Benson's stepson Jacob. It's not necessarily a good emotional side: Jacob is a whiny, obstinate and disobedient little boy that would lead most extraterrestrials -- and not a few of the rest of us -- to reach for the destruct button. Still, it's surely remiss to wipe out the species before lending an ear to Johann Sebastian Bach. The original movie is beginning to show its age, but at least it holds up as a story. That's more than you can say for a preachy, draggy blockbuster that espouses a radical message of Luddite technophobia at the same time as it conspicuously plugs Honda and LG Electronics, and dresses up its half-baked thinking in blinding (but not that brilliant) CGI wizardry. Johnny Carson used to joke that his 1964 bomb ""Looking for Love"" was so bad it was transferred to flammable nitrate film stock. If they're so determined to be green, perhaps the producers of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" would consider something biodegradable. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is rated PG-13 and runs 103 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.",0.70718247,2588
42,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Baz Luhrmann is the type of director for whom the word innovative was invented. Luhrmann and his costume designer wife Catherine Martin, who is a long time collaborator. With a filmography comprising of just three full-length feature films, (and one currently in post-production) Luhrmann has produced a stunning and highly visual body of work that is loved and loathed in equal measures. His films have a tendency to suck the viewer up into a swirling vortex of lush imagery and a lavish production style, often with a frenetic pace that one critic described as being like ""a madman on Benzedrine"". But there is a method to Luhrmann's madness. The trio of films, ""Strictly Ballroom,"" an adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" all form part of a specific filmmaking technique described by Luhrmann as ""The Red Curtain"" cinema. Luhrmann incorporates traditional theatrical conventions into his films and morphs them to create visual treats in stories set in heightened otherworlds. Simple devices like song and dance are then used to drive the action. He always surrounds himself with the same creative team for all of his projects. His wife, production and costume designer Catherine Martin, who is known as CM, is intrinsic to his striking visual style. In his directorial debut ""Strictly Ballroom,"" Luhrmann injected dazzling colors and energetic dance moves into the stuffy world of ballroom dancing and was credited with making the genre hip again. Luhrmann himself was a ballroom dancer from the age of six, and the film reflects his affection for and intimate knowledge of that world. An intensely personal director who always draws on his own experiences, Luhrmann told CNN's The Screening Room: ""Art and life cannot be separated, they feed each other and creative decisions are based on what will make life rich and what will enrich the story telling. What I make comes from a personal level."" It paid off for ""Strictly Ballroom,"" which became a global hit, winning eight Australian Film Institute Awards, three BAFTAs, and the Cannes Film Festival's Prix de Jeunesse in 1992. In 1996, Luhrmann worked his magic again in ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" an MTV-style version of the classic love story set in latter-day Miami Beach, complete with warring gangs wielding automatic weapons. But it was in ""Moulin Rouge!"" that the Red Curtain's opulent and extravagant theatrical style would explode in, spectacular, some would say violent, fashion. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, it explored a young writer's foray into the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Following the film's box-office success Luhrmann landed a highly lucrative Chanel contract, making a Red Curtain-inspired 2004 film for Chanel No. 5, starring Nicole Kidman. At $36m, it is reputedly one of the most expensive adverts of all time. The maverick movie-maker began his film career as an actor, training at the prestigious National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney, but it wasn't long before he was employing his flamboyant and creative talent behind the scenes. What seems to drive Luhrmann is his huge passion and appetite for all art forms. He is a veritable Jack-of-all trades: a writer-director who has produced theatre and opera pieces, worked as a guest editor for Australian Vogue and in 1999, Luhrmann scored a surprise-hit single with ""Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)."" Following his Red Curtain trilogy, Luhrmann planned to move onto epic storytelling. He started work on a retelling of Alexander the Great, set to star Leonardo DiCaprio. But the film was set aside when Oliver Stone's version was released -- and flopped -- in 2004. """"My next great passion after musicals is the epic-- telling a recognizable universal story using a vast canvas of a far away place and historical events,"" he tells CNN. ""I embarked on that in my exploration of doing Alexander the Great. At one stage, I was collaborating with DreamWorks and Steven Spielberg. ""We were looking at sets around the world and studios were built in Northern Africa and Thailand. It got a long way down the road but for various reasons, not just because of the competing project, we walked away from it,"" he explains. ""For where we were in our life particularly because we were embarking on a very personal part of our story to have children, it wasn't right. ""It's all about the timing and what is right for your life in that moment in time. We walked away from that and I never regret that for a second."" After a seven-year hiatus, during which he and CM have had two ""magical, incredible children,"" Luhrmann has finally made his epic film, simply titled ""Australia,"" with a budget of $130m, making it the expensive movie ever made in the country. ""Australia"" is a love letter to his home country. In it Nicole Kidman plays an English aristocrat who travels to 1930s Australia to sell a cattle ranch. A grueling journey across country with a rough drover (Hugh Jackman) ends with the pair witnessing the Japanese bombardment of Darwin at the start of the Second World War. ""It's been a long time since we've had those huge banquet like motion pictures, when I was a kid, if a big epic was coming it was a big event and the whole family went,"" Luhrmann says. ""It's big drama, comedy, landscape -- a huge banquet and I would like to invite the audience to this cinematic table."" Luhrmann is unsure if the departure from his normal style is a good career move but is adamant ""it's a good life move."" ""We found our inner spirit enlivened again,"" he says. Luhrmann, (unlike CM), has been thus far overlooked for an Oscar award, but ""Australia,"" a big, bold movie with a vast emotional landscape is just the sort of film the Academy loves. Come 2009, it seems they will no longer be able to ignore Luhrmann's considerable -- and -- inimitable talents. What do you think of Luhrmann's cinematic style? Do you love it or loathe it?

43,"(CNN) -- More timely now than when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008, ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" an agreeable, midrange independent film, makes light work of heavy burdens. Amy Adams gets to work cleaning up as Rose in the indie comedy ""Sunshine Cleaning."" Sisters Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Emily Blunt) struggle with menial jobs and periods of unemployment. Together, they're also coping with the nasty emotional residue of their mom's long-ago suicide -- a trauma that is likely responsible for their current troubles. Self-esteem isn't a strong suit for either of them. As ""Sunshine Cleaning"" dawns, they're both scraping by. If Norah is out of work before we've settled into our popcorn, she's not overly concerned by her situation. Rose, on the other hand, is desperate to graduate from cleaning other people's middle-class homes. It's not just that the humiliation of laundering for her old cheerleader team is getting her down; she needs the money to put her ""difficult"" kid (Jason Spevack) into the kind of school that will give him a chance. It's Rose's married boyfriend -- and old high school sweetheart -- Mac (Steve Zahn) who spies a new niche for the sisters. A homicide detective, he's watching the cleaning crew bag the blown brains of a shotgun enthusiast when he overhears the proprietor of the building grousing about the ""three grand"" it's costing him. Granted, blood and intestinal juices aren't everybody's cup of tea, but that kind of return sure beats washing Mrs. Johansson's drapes for $30 an hour. ""CSM: Crime Scene Maid"" isn't a job you're likely to find down at the employment office, but somebody must be doing the dirty work. Rose and Norah -- incorporated -- find that the stench takes some getting used to, and there's a whole new arsenal of cleaning fluids to master, but they get to work with a positive attitude and like to think they're doing their bit to put the world right. From this unusual setup, the movie might have skewed in any number of ways. The sisters might have uncovered evidence of corruption and murder, for instance, perhaps implicating Mac? ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is nowhere near so abrasive or generic as such a scenario. Written by Megan Holley and directed by Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia""), it instead puts a sympathetic, gentle comic gloss on the characters' fundamentally forgivable foibles and imperfections. Norah tracks down the daughter of one suicide (Mary Lynn Rajskub) to present her with mementos that should have been destined for the junkyard. Blunt's edgy performance keeps us guessing. Norah's a bit of a flake, but she's animated by her anger and her rebellious streak. If she's hard to read, it's because she's still young and doesn't know herself yet. Rose is easier to understand. She's determined to seize this chance to dig herself out of the hole and recapture the promise she used to see in herself. Adams has a knack for putting a brave face on things -- something about the way she tilts her chin up while her mouth goes in three directions at once. She keeps our rooting interest in Rose alive even when her choices seem misguided or naive. A subplot concerning Rose's son bonding with Joe (Alan Arkin), the sisters' lovable but infuriating father (you know the kind: He buys bulk orders of shrimp off the back of a truck) tips us too far into the realm of indie quirk. The character is a useful sounding board, and an amusing grouch, but it's just about impossible to imagine this man bringing up these girls. Ironically, for a movie that's marketed with the one-liner ""Life's a messy business,"" Holley's script has been polished to within an inch of its life. Emotions are experienced most vividly when they're raw, but in ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" feelings come filtered through neat-and-tidy grace notes. The film flirts with dangerous material, but it's too intent on putting the sunny side up to get its hands dirty. The way director Jeffs tells it, not only is suicide painless it can be positively feel-good. That's not to say there isn't a lot to enjoy in this well-acted and humanistic comedy. Buoyed by its up-and-coming stars and its optimistic message, it should do very nicely with discriminating audiences. ... It might even clean up.",0.7014616,2739
45,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When a woman dates a much older man, bystanders often speculate that she has only the most superficial of motives. French actress Ludivine Sagnier stars in veteran New Wave filmmaker Claude Chabrol's ""The Girl Cut in Two."" In ""The Girl Cut in Two,"" veteran French filmmaker Claude Chabrol tells the story of one young woman for whom just the opposite is true. It stars French starlet Ludivine Sagnier as a young woman who rejects the amorous advances of a flashy, wealthy man her age, in favor of a sleazy affair with a fickle, 60 year-old father figure. Sagnier's desire to take on the role was also motivated by the allure of a much older man: Chabrol. ""The idea of working with Claude Chabrol was the main attraction at the beginning,"" she told CNN. ""He is a great French director, one of the pioneers of the French New Wave."" ""The guy has so much experience. I felt like I was a journalist, always asking things,"" continues Sagnier. ""He's very old ... he's been through many, many things. This was his 66th movie, or something like that."" Sagnier describes her character, Gabrielle de Neige, a charming, 20-something television weather girl, as ""very naive."" ""She falls in a trap like a poor little lamb and she gets eaten by wolves. ""The thing is, she doesn't have a dad, so she lacks affection, and sometimes that lack of affection can drive you to make mistakes. ""I'd say I'm stronger than that,"" says 29 year-old Sagnier, who is perhaps best-known for her provocative portrayal of a highly-sexualized teenager opposite Charlotte Rampling in Francois Ozon's 2003 drama, ""Swimming Pool."" Sagnier who is often compared with screen sirens like Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve, drew international acclaim for a series of films in 2002 and 2003, but has recently has been taking smaller roles. Many of the qualities that attracted Sagnier to Chabrol are similar to those that draw her on-screen alter-ego Gabrielle to writer Charles Saint-Denis (Francois Berleand) -- Charles' knowledge of life, literature and his ability to treat her like a little girl, not as an equal. Sagnier says of working with Chabrol: ""It was like opening a cinema book, because when you work with him he talks to you about Hitchcock, he talks to you about Kubrick. ""He met everyone, so he's full of anecdotes, so you want to know more."" Chabrol began his career in 1956, earning his stripes alongside fellow New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut. He became famous in the late 1960s for suspense thrillers such as ""La Femme Infidele"" (1969) and ""Le Boucher"" (1971). He has continued working prolifically in film and television ever since. Chabrol co-wrote the screenplay for the heartbreak drama, in which Sagnier character is consistently disappointed in love and let down by the men around her, with his step-daughter, Cecile Maistre, who also served as assistant director on the film. At the end of ""The Girl Cut In Two,"" Sagnier appears on stage as a magician's assistant, smiling in the spotlight as she hears applause rise from the audience, the attention perhaps curing her depression over lovers lost. She lies in a box, appearing to be cut in half, the trick functioning as an almost literal embodiment of the film's title -- but clearly there's more to it than meets the eye. ""She cuts into two men first of all, and she's also cut in two different sides of her personality,"" said Sagnier. ""She has a part of shade and a part of lightness."" Sagnier's fate since her collaboration with Chabrol has, thankfully, been a decidedly rosier affair: Since finishing ""The Girl Cut in Two,"" she has starred in Jean-Francois Richet's, ""Public Enemy No. 1,"" which received more nominations than any other film at the 2009 Cesar Awards, France's equivalent of the Oscars. The indefatigable Chabrol has recently wrapped up yet another film: ""Bellamy"" starring Gerard Depardieu. ""The Girl Cut In Two"" is released in the UK on 22 May 2009 .",0.7014018,4083
46,"(CNN) -- Mike Myers' ""Love Guru"" may speak of ""yin and yang,"" but the Hollywood version of bad balanced by good might be the Razzies and the Oscars. Mike Myers' ""The Love Guru"" was one of the year's biggest bombs. The day before the Motion Picture Academy releases the Oscar nominations -- honoring the movie industry's best -- the Golden Raspberry Award foundation reveals nominations for the Razzies, which recognize the worst films of 2008. And in 2008, Razzie founder and self-styled ""Head Raspberry"" John Wilson said, the bad seemed to outweigh the good among the 578 movies released. ""We are saying that it wasn't just the economy that tanked,"" Wilson said. ""So did the quality of the movies being offered to those of us who don't have as much money to buy tickets."" ""All of the voting was very close this year,"" he said. ""There just was too much stuff to choose from."" The bumper crop of ""putrid motion pictures"" may be partly a result of last spring's writers' strike ""when nobody was rewriting, polishing or improving anything and it was still getting filmed,"" Wilson said. Bombs also happen when studios hedge their bets with high-priced stars by having them ""do what worked before, coming back to same well."" Which brings us back to Myers' ""Love Guru,"" which followed his hugely profitable ""Austin Powers"" franchise. Myers' portrayal of ""a platitude-spouting mystic"" leads the Razzie list for worst picture, Wilson said. It may also have been the biggest box office bomb: the film, expected to be a summer hit, lost $30 million, he said. Other worst picture nominees include ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" -- both featuring the same writer-directors and essentially the same cast. The latter film ""somehow managed to work references to Britney Spears into an ancient Spartan 'plot,' "" Wilson said. Also competing for the top dishonor is ""The Happening,"" which Wilson described as ""an eco-disaster tale whose 'villain' drew more guffaws than gasps,"" and Paris Hilton's ""The Hottie and the Nottie,"" which earned three Razzie nominations overall. ""She really is neither a movie star or an actress,"" Wilson said of Hilton. The movie -- for which Hilton was listed as executive producer -- sold only $27,000 in tickets but cost about $2 million to make. Other Razzie nominees include actor-comedian Eddie Murphy, who received two nominations for ""Meet Dave""; Oscar winner Al Pacino, who earned a Razzie nod for making ""two rotten movies this year,"" in Wilson's words (he's referring to ""88 Minutes"" and ""Righteous Kill""); and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which was singled out as ""Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel."" Despite the opinions of Wilson and the Razzie voters, it was the year's third-highest-grossing movie. And a rare Razzie for ""Worst Career Achievement"" will go to ""Bad Movie Uber-Meister"" Uwe Boll for ""In the Name of the King,"" Wilson said. The film, based on a video game, had a $60 million budget, yet brought in under $5 million at the box office, he said. Wilson said he began the Razzies in 1981 as a counterpoint to the Oscars. It takes guts to show up in person to accept a Razzie, but some notable actors have embraced the infamy, Wilson said. Tom Green, who made ""a horrible little thing called 'Freddy Got Fingered' "" several years ago, ""insisted that he made the film with the intent of sweeping the Razzie Awards,"" Wilson said. Green showed up to accept his three awards with great enthusiasm, he said. ""At the end of the ceremony, he launched into a harmonica solo and we had to pry his hands off the podium and physically remove him from the stage,"" Wilson said. The classiest and most memorable acceptance speech came in 2005 when Halle Berry showed up to get her worst actress Razzie for her ""Catwoman"" performance. Berry, who won a best actress Oscar for ""Monster's Ball"" in 2001, was given a one-minute standing ovation, Wilson said. ""She had her Oscar in one hand and her Razzie in the other,"" Wilson said. Berry's speech was a parody of her Academy Award acceptance and ""she was quite funny,"" he said. ""She said that her mother had taught her that if you cannot accept valid criticism, you also, by the same token, are not entitled to bask in the glory when you get the good reviews,"" he said. The appearance and her sense of humor earned Berry a lot of respect, he said. The awards show -- a ""shorter parody"" of the Oscars -- can be seen only by members and journalists in person at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Hollywood on February 21. It cannot be televised or streamed online because studios would likely withhold permission for clips used in the presentation to be shown, Wilson said. Unlike the Oscars and other honors, Golden Raspberry Awards are not meant as recommendations for people to rent the DVDs, Wilson said.

The Missing Link, Ginormica, the blue blob B.O.B. and Insectosaurus dominate ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" And they're the good guys. Reese Witherspoon leads the cast of ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" providing the voice of Susan, who is hit by a glowing meteorite on her wedding day. Before long she's grown into the biggest thing around. The short-statured Oscar winner relished the chance to play not only a giant, but also a role model. ""I was walking with my son and my daughter the other day, and I was like 'Who's your favorite superhero?' "" Witherspoon said. ""And my son was like ... 'Batman, Superman, Spiderman,' and he could name 20 guy superheroes. ""And so I said to my daughter, 'Who's your favorite superhero?' And she goes 'I don't know, the girl in the back of the Justice League? I can't remember her name.' "" So the idea of showcasing a female superhero, Witherspoon said, has the actress ""really excited."" Kiefer Sutherland, who plays General W.R. Monger, sees the film as helping kids embrace their diversity. ""I love the idea that they were gonna make a film that was going to tell young people that it's all right to be different,"" Sutherland said. His military veteran character captures Susan, renames her ""Ginormica,"" and locks her up with the other ""monsters"" he's collected over half a century. ""And not only is it all right to be different, that one thing that may make you feel awkward about being different might be your greatest asset."" Those assets become apparent when an alien invader (voiced by Rainn Wilson of ""The Office"") decides he wants Earth, and the monsters -- Ginormica, Dr. Cockroach (""House"" star Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link (Will Arnett), and the gelatinous B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) -- are called upon to save the planet. The film, which also features the voices of Stephen Colbert and Paul Rudd, opens Friday. Most of the cast had previous experience in animation voiceover -- last year, Rogen was featured in ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and he and Arnett were heard in ""Horton Hears A Who!"" -- but it was the first time for Wilson. ""They called me and they said 'They're interested in you for this, playing an evil alien warlord,' and I was like 'Where do I sign?' "" he said with a chuckle. It was a welcome change of pace for Sutherland, who recorded his voice tracks for ""Monsters"" while he was filming the uber-intense ""24."" ""So, for five days a week I'm very serious in the '24' world, and then for five hours on the weekend I got to be 5 years old and just play a cartoon character"" -- a character he says he saw as a combination of R. Lee Ermey's intense gunnery sergeant in ""Full Metal Jacket"" and that 'toon terror, Yosemite Sam. ""We combined these voices and the producers laughed, which is generally a pretty good sign,"" Sutherland said. Sutherland may have been inspired by the classics, but the 3-D aspect of ""Monsters"" is as modern as movie technology gets. Under the command of DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg (whom Witherspoon and Sutherland respectfully called ""Mr. Katzenberg""), the film was conceived from the beginning as a 3-D project. One early scene uses the process to bounce a paddleball out at the audience, but for the most part, the effect is used immersively, to bring viewers into the ""Monsters"" world. ""You really feel like you're there, like you're a part of this thing,"" said Arnett, ""not in a way that's gratuitous and to just sort of show off, but really so that the viewer can be an active participant in the movie."" While film technology continues to advance, some things never change. As Susan is still trying to get used to her new size and powers, she finds herself simultaneously battling an alien robot and trying to save dozens of people trapped in their cars on the Golden Gate Bridge while her male cohorts mostly just stand around. One tries to encourage her by calling ""You're doing it!"" to which Susan snaps back, ""I'm doing everything!"" ""The quintessential cry!"" Witherspoon said. ""The female war cry! That's one of my favorite lines."" iReport.com: Does 3-D make you more likely to see a movie? Of course, it's hardly a spoiler to reveal that -- eventually -- Susan not only bonds with the rest of her motley crew, but also gains the self-confidence to see the positives in her accidental enormousness. As Wilson, the film's villain, noted, ""It's a coming-of-age tale -- for the monster inside of each one of us."" And, perhaps, it will give some little girls a superhero to look up to.",0.6994799,2223
49,"(CNN) -- Greg Cannom. Remember that name. The late Heath Ledger is expected to win best supporting actor for playing the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" It's not a household name, for sure. But this two-time Academy Award winner (for ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") is the red-hot favorite to win the Oscar in the best makeup category, for his work taking Brad Pitt from decrepitude to infancy in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" His colleagues in the visual effects department are likely to join him, along with the art direction team and possibly costume designer Jacqueline West, taking ""Button's"" tally to four awards. But my hunch is that this will prove the outer limit of the Academy's love for David Fincher's epic. Not a good return on 13 nominations.  Watch which films, stars are up for top honors » . On the other hand, I predict that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" will reap the rewards, with as many as seven Oscars from 10 nominations, including best picture and best director for Danny Boyle. (A full sweep is impossible, as composer A.R. Rahman has been nominated against himself in the best song category. ""Slumdog"" will also probably miss out for sound editing and sound mixing, two categories that favor big-budget films.)  Watch how ""Slumdog"" is getting mixed reviews in India » . If I'm right, it will be a fairy-tale ending for what is in many respects a fairy tale of a movie, albeit a fairy tale punctuated with sometimes distressingly grim episodes of violence and poverty. Still, upsets do happen. Four years ago, all the pundits (including this one) had ""Brokeback Mountain"" pegged for best picture. Instead, a left-field movie that had been kicking around for months surged from behind and ""Crash""-ed the party. EW's Dave Karger makes his predictions . It could happen again, but this year ""Slumdog"" is -- or at least began as -- the left-field movie. The surprise came when American audiences embraced the energy and passion (the underdog spirit, if you will) of Boyle's film. After all, this was a film that Warner Bros. almost consigned straight to DVD until Fox Searchlight stepped up and obtained U.S. theatrical rights. North American box office receipts will probably reach the $100 million mark soon, making the $15 million film easily the most profitable of the best picture contenders. (""Benjamin Button"" has grossed more, but with a budget estimated at $150 million, it cost 10 times as much to make.)  Vote for your favorite nominees in major categories » . Best actor . The ""Slumdog"" wave won't affect the acting categories, not because the Academy struggles to recognize Indian excellence but because the lead roles in the film are split between three generations of young actors. Similar considerations will weigh against Brad Pitt's chances for best actor, despite his outstanding performance as ""Benjamin Button's"" lead. No one seems entirely clear where Pitt leaves off and the makeup, the CGI and the four other actors credited with playing the part take over. The pundits have decided that this category is a straight choice between Sean Penn (""Milk"") and Mickey Rourke (""The Wrestler""), and although I wouldn't rule out Frank Langella for his strangely sympathetic portrait of the disgraced president in ""Frost/Nixon,"" I have to agree that Penn and Rourke are both compelling choices, and either would be a worthy winner. Given the soft love the Academy has shown ""The Wrestler"" (two nominations) compared with ""Milk"" (eight, including best picture), Penn is the smart choice. But my heart goes with Rourke. Penn transforms himself to play Harvey Milk, but Rourke does something more difficult; he reveals himself.  Watch how Rourke made a comeback to get Oscar nomination » . Best actress . This category, like best actor, seems to come down to a choice between two: Meryl Streep (who overpowers the ethical uncertainties of ""Doubt"") and Kate Winslet (who contrives to make a mass murderer sexy and sympathetic in ""The Reader""). These are two ostentatious, technically demanding performances of the kind that Oscar voters appreciate; Melissa Leo's understated naturalism in the little-seen ""Frozen River"" would stand at the opposite end of the spectrum, well out of the limelight. It's astonishing that Streep -- by common consent our finest actress -- hasn't won an Academy Award since ""Sophie's Choice"" (1982), a losing streak that runs through 10 nominations (and counting). But at least she already has a couple of Oscars on her mantel, which is more than you can say for Kate Winslet, hoping it will be sixth-time lucky on Sunday. In this critic's opinion, she's been nominated for the wrong performance and the wrong film (""Revolutionary Road"" would have been my choice), but I've had more arguments about ""The Reader"" than any of the other contenders this year, and I suspect that there is enough support out there for a Winslet win. iReport.com: iReporter sees Streep winning . Supporting actress . I think we'll see Penelope Cruz triumph for her fabulously funny bilingual artist in Woody Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona.""

50,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, ""Antichrist"" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter. Danish auteur Lars von Trier has been making films that shock, provoke and impress for over 40 years. Filmmakers are expected to give audiences a hard time at Cannes and the two-hander starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a couple grieving the loss of a child is no exception. But it was the level of pornographic sex and visceral brutality that outraged some and astonished many. Von Trier was labeled a woman-hater for the wince-inducingly horrific final scene in which female lead Charlotte Gainsbourg takes a pair of rusty scissors to her genitals and performs a DIY clitoridectomy right to camera. An Ecumenical Jury that normally hands out a prize at Cannes celebrating spiritual values felt moved to award ""Antichrist"" an ""anti-prize"" for being ""the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world."" ""Lars von Trier, we get it,"" wrote film critic Wendy Ide in UK paper The Times. ""You really, really don't like women."" Misogyny couldn't be further from the truth, according to Von Trier, who says he sees himself up there on the screen: ""I mostly see myself as the female character,"" the 53-year-old director told CNN in Cannes. Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . The director says that he shot the film as a form of therapy after recovering from a serious mental illness. Indeed, a few years ago, it was questionable whether von Trier, who is famously multi-phobic, would be able to make another film. In the winter of 2006, he fell victim to depression and checked into hospital, the aftermath of which left him ""like a blank sheet of paper,"" he told Danish paper Politiken at the time. Today, if not fully recovered -- the most terrifying thing he can think of is still ""myself"" -- he is able to function once more and is receiving cognitive behavioral therapy to help him face up to his psychological issues. Despite, or perhaps because of, what he describes as his ""sensitive"" nature, von Trier is one of today's great contemporary European auteurs, considered responsible for spearheading a revival in the fortunes of Scandinavian filmmaking. ""I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it,"" said von Trier. ""The good side is that you can sometimes achieve something creatively. But, of course, it always also allows some of these negative thoughts in.""  Watch Lars von Trier talking to CNN's The Screening Room about ""Antichrist"" » . He has been nominated for the top prize at Cannes, the Palme D'Or, a staggering eight times, winning once in 2000 for the harrowing operatic tragedy, ""Dancer in the Dark,"" starring Icelandic musician, Bjork, who also took home the Best Actress prize that year. It is rumored Bjork became so unhinged filming ""Dancer in the Dark"" she ate her own cardigan. Von Trier claimed each morning she would say ""Mr von Trier, I despise you,"" and spit at him.  In pictures: The wierd world of Lars von Trier » . Von Trier has a reputation for being tough on his actors. His friend and long-time collaborator, actor Stellan Skarsgard describes von Trier as ""not uncomplex."" ""I was scared,"" admitted Gainsbourg who won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance. ""I had heard stories about him as a director ... maybe he's cruel and vicious."" But she now describes him as her ""guide"" and ""the greatest director I've ever worked with."" Fueled by his unconventional approach and upbringing, the mythology surrounding von Trier looms large over everything he touches. Brought up in Copenhagen by bohemian parents who were committed nudists, he suffers from crippling bouts of agoraphobia; and, most famously, a fear of flying. Each visit to Cannes involves a five-day road trip from Denmark to the French Riviera by camper van. He has an undeniable egotistical streak: this year at Cannes, he declared, ""I am the best filmmaker in the world,"" and in 1991, when displeased that Cannes jury president Roman Polanski had only awarded ""Europa"" the runner-up Grand Prix prize, he called him a ""dwarf."" He also seems to actively court controversy: 1998 Palme D'Or contender ""Dogme #2: The Idiots"" grabbed headlines for being the first commercial film to show non-simulated sex on screen, and for von Trier's typically eccentric claim that the best way to prepare actors for sex scenes is to direct in the nude. But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates. He says he finds it difficult to know how to satisfy the needs of others with his films and so works only for himself. ""I feel very strongly for satisfying, maybe not my own needs, but my own idea of the film and the images that come from within,"" he told CNN. ""If I didn't follow my instinct, then I can't work.""",0.6986833,6842
51,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Hey, Hey It's Esther Blueburger"" is the latest comic creation to emerge from the Australian film market. Guy Pearce, Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp star in the camp classic ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."" An unabashed celebration of girlishness, the coming-of-age movie tells the story of Esther, a   bespectacled and awkward teen. Looked down on as nerd at her posh private school, Esther (played by newcomer Danielle Catanzariti) reinvents herself after befriending Sunni, an older girl who goes to the local public school. Bearing a passing resemblance to the runaway U.S. indie hit ""Juno"", ""Esther Blueburger"" could well go on to imitate some of the worldwide success of its hipper American cousin. If the film is to do well, its kitschness can surely only work to its advantage. After all, many of the Australian comedies that have found success with an international audience have relied on more than just a smattering of camp. Oddly, from a country that brought the world ""Mad Max"" and Russell Crowe, many of the biggest comic hits fly in the face of the conventional stereotypes of Australian culture as straight-talking and macho. For every ""Crocodile Dundee"", in other words, there is a ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", riding triumphantly over the horizon ready to unsettle the manhood and steal the laughs into the bargain. It was Paul Hogan's comic creation Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee, the laidback survivalist from the outback that first put Australian comic films on the map over 20 years ago. The first ""Crocodile Dundee"" film was released in 1986 to huge commercial success worldwide -- it was the highest grossing film internationally that year -- spawned two sequels and was credited with boosting the Australian tourist industry. A lot of the laughs in the film come from the depiction of Mick Dundee (played by Hogan) as an unreconstructed, Aussie bloke struggling to come to terms with modern metropolitan life when he leaves small town Australia to visit New York. In one scene, for example, Dundee's reaction to meeting a cross-dresser on the streets of the Big Apple is to grab the man's crotch to verify his gender. Crocodile Dundee's comic book version of Australian identity may have worked well in the movie theaters, but it was viewed by many critics as hackneyed and out of touch with the reality of modern Australia. The arrival of the writer and director Baz Luhrmann in the early '90s seemed to breath fresh life into Australian film. The stunning critical and financial success of his debut feature, ""Strictly Ballroom"" in 1992 heralded a string of breakout hits that weren't afraid to show their feminine side. The story of a young ballroom dancer who flouts convention and risks the ire of the judges by dancing his own moves, ""Strictly Ballroom"" provoked a bidding war at the Cannes Film Festival after it won the Prix de Jeunesse award. Alongside a realistic portrayal of Australian small town life, there is a warm-hearted send up of the peculiar world of ballroom dancing. From the sequined costumes to the Cyndi Lauper soundtrack, the movie is also saturated in campness and kitsch. The benchmark set by Luhrmann, whose 2001 stellar musical feature ""Moulin Rouge!"" was also defiantly camp, was matched by ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" in 1994 and by ""Muriel's Wedding"" to a lesser extent the same year. ""Priscilla"" in particular created a huge stir when it was first released. Starring the venerable British actor Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving, it is the story of three drag queens driving across the outback from Sydney to Alice Springs in a large bus they have named Priscilla. It has gone on to be regarded as a camp classic -- though perhaps not in South Korea, where it was reportedly banned for fear it might encourage homosexuality. Less overtly camp than ""Priscilla"", ""Muriel's Wedding"" celebrates the lighter side of femininity. The story of a socially awkward 'ugly duckling' whose daydreams of a glamorous white wedding are soundtracked by Abba music, the film was a surprise hit globally and launched the Hollywood career of Toni Collette -- who has a role in ""Esther Blueburger"". Muriel (played by Collette) tramps around in leopard skin inviting bitchy comments from her crass friends until she eventually plucks up the courage to head to the city. Like ""Strictly Ballroom"", it exposes the mean-spiritedness that can blight small town life -- in this case the small town in question is the kitschy fictional coastal setting of Porpoise Spit. As well as their camp credentials, one thing these films share in common is a reluctance to slip into stereotyped depictions of Australians. Questions of national identity are explored with more subtlety through a range of characters, and the image of the Aussie bloke immortalised in the character of Mick Dundee is made to look a dated simplification. Still, this onslaught of camp sometimes proves too much, even for some of the films' characters. As Bernadette (played by Stamp) tells her fellow drag queens at one point in ""Priscilla"": ""I'll join this conversation on the proviso that we stop bitching about people, talking about wigs, dresses, bust sizes, penises, drugs, night clubs, and bloody Abba!"" To which Weaving's character Tick snaps back: ""Doesn't give us much to talk about then, does it?""",0.6960046,3057
52,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Arriving at the London premiere of his self-titled mockumentary dressed in an enormous bearskin hat, cropped red army tunic and barely there hot pants, flamboyant Austrian fashionista, ""Bruno,"" paid sartorial tribute to the British as only he knows how. Bear-ing all: British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen's latest comic creation Austrian fashionista, Bruno, hits the red carpet. Waxed to perfection and flanked by a group of muscular black men dressed like a camp Queen's Guards, the gay fashion reporter flounced down the carpet to greet his public. ""Vassup CNN! Lookin' hot,"" Bruno said to CNN. ""I don't want any attention; I'm not here to promote my movie."" ""Bruno,"" which hits cinemas in most territories next month, is the latest comic creation of British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who last shocked, insulted and delighted audiences in 2006 with Borat, Kazakhstan's ""Most Famous Broadcaster."" Bruno continues the unique approach to comedy Baron Cohen honed with characters like uneducated, loutish jungle music fan Ali G and then homophobic, anti-Semitic Kazakh journalist Borat.  Watch ""Bruno"" on the red carpet » . His specialty is characters who say the unsayable: like Bruno's carpet quip that his new film is ""the most important movie starring a gay Austrian since 'Terminator 2,'"" in joking reference to the married (and firmly heterosexual) Austrian Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, now Governor of California.  In pictures: Bruno offers fashion advice to CNN » . Baron Cohen puts his creations in real-life situations and uses them to draw unsuspecting participants into letting well-hidden prejudices slip out, engage in embarrassing behavior or contradict themselves. Characters like Bruno and Borat ""essentially work as a tool,"" Baron Cohen told UK paper The Observer in a rare out-of-character interview: ""By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice."" Baron Cohen's approach courts controversy. ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" opened to a wave of outrage from race-relations campaigners. This time it is gay-rights campaigners who are up in arms. ""Sacha Baron Cohen's well-meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others,"" Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation told the New York Times. While some critics may suggest that his films may reinforce prejudices, others disagree. ""It is difficult to accuse Cohen of making films that are racist or homophobic,"" Aubrey Day, Editor-in-Chief of Total Film magazine told CNN. ""He takes characters and exaggerates them for broad comic value, but I don't think there's any credence in the idea that he supports any of those ideals."" But Baron Cohen certainly knows how to manipulate the media. The 37-year-old has been whipping up anticipation for ""Bruno"" with a series of attention-grabbing, hilarious stunts. In September last year, he brought chaos to the hallowed fashion shows of Milan when he stormed the catwalk of designer Agata Luiz de la Prada's show dressed in a Velcro suit with clothes from backstage stuck all over it. Most recently, he descended from the ceiling at the MTV Movie Awards wearing nothing but a pair of angel's wings and a skimpy thong before ""falling"" onto irate rapper Eminem's face. Eminem stormed out of the awards but later admitted he knew about the stunt beforehand. ""Borat"" debuted at number one in the U.S. box office and went on to gross $300 million in box office and DVD sales. Industry experts are predicting an even bigger return for ""Bruno."" The secret of the Baron Cohen comedy phenomenon may lie in his combination of laughs with something a bit deeper: namely his ability to highlight prejudices and hypocrisies. ""What he does very well is hold a mirror up to a lot of society's current ideals and expose them for what they are,"" Day told CNN. ""That is one of the joys of his films. ""You can enjoy them on a simple level, in that they are very funny, but hopefully you also come away thinking, or maybe re-thinking some of your attitudes.""",0.6945462,6457
53,"(CNN) -- Comedy isn't evolutionary. Hollywood has been plundering ancient history for yuks at least since Buster Keaton's day, and there's little in ""Year One"" to suggest we've progressed much over the last 90 years. Michael Cera and Jack Black go in search of meaning -- and some food -- in ""Year One."" Quite the opposite, in fact. It's a stretch to envisage Keaton picking up bear poop, as Jack Black does here, giving it an appraising sniff, then a quick lick. And I can't imagine him peeing down his own nostrils, as Michael Cera does (he's chained upside down at the time). Not to say this monkey business isn't funny; these are the highlights of a relentlessly low-brow lark, notwithstanding several sophomoric speeches in a panicky existentialist vein. Black is Zed, a sorry excuse for a hunter in a tribe that has yet to discover the wheel. His buddy Oh (Cera) is even further down the totem pole, a mere gatherer. Neither is a hit with the ladies, and when Zed is exiled after stealing forbidden fruit, well, not even Oh wants to go with him -- though of course he does tag along. It's no fun being a sidekick all on your lonesome. Co-written and directed by comedy veteran Harold Ramis (""Ghostbusters,"" ""Groundhog Day""), ""Year One"" is little more than a series of juvenile skits dressed up in toga party glad rags. It rambles off into Old Testament territory when the boys stumble across Cain (David Cross) killing his brother Abel (Paul Rudd), then arrive in the desert in the nick of time to save Isaac's neck (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) from his zealous father's knife -- though his foreskin is another story. Sorely lacking the anarchic edge that Monty Python brought to ""The Life of Brian"" and the sheer chutzpah of Mel Brooks' ""History of the World: Part One,"" ""Year One"" is more akin to one of those old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby jaunts -- two guys bicker and banter in exotic climes, hopping from scrape to scrape without ever reaching the bottom of the barrel. Inevitably, Zed and Oh find themselves on the Road to Sodom, where Oliver Platt's plummy High Priest orchestrates orgies in the afternoon then presides over human sacrifices in the evening. It is in Sodom that the boys will prove their manhood. Black's manic over-reacher and Cera's shy mumbler complement each other well enough in theory, but at 39, Black is almost old enough to be the 21-year-old Cera's father. It's a big age gap for a comedy duo, and they never quite mesh or convince as bosom buddies, even if they're fairly amusing separately. Among the supporting cast, only Hank Azaria's fundamentalist Abraham really seizes on the possibilities; he and Platt deliver the goods. Too many others, on the other hand, just seem to have dropped by to hang out for a day or two on set. Typically, neither Juno Temple nor June Diane Raphael gets any breathing room as the heroes' designated distressed damsels; Ramis ogles female flesh as enthusiastically as he milks homophobia for cheap laughs. Bearing the tell-tale scars of slash-and-burn post-market testing editing -- several early scenes simply hit a brick wall -- ""Year One"" isn't an out-and-out disaster. It's just another feeble comedy that never finds its rhythm or builds up a head of steam. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Year One"" It was probably a lot more fun to make than it is to watch, but we'll have to take that on trust.

54,"(CNN) -- When it comes to the Academy Awards, Hollywood has some biases. The late Heath Ledger won a Golden Globe for his performance as The Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" Summer blockbusters get short shrift. Comedies aren't taken seriously. And animated features? They almost never get drawn. Which, on the surface, doesn't bode well for three of the biggest movie stories of the year: ""The Dark Knight,"" Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in ""Tropic Thunder,"" and Pixar's latest marvel, ""WALL-E."" Each earned critical plaudits and box office success. And each faces an uphill struggle nabbing major-category Oscar nominations when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announces its shortlists Thursday morning. Awards expert Tom O'Neil, who follows the Oscars for the Los Angeles Times' TheEnvelope.com, says the best-picture front-runners are ""Frost/Nixon,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" ""Milk"" and Golden Globe best drama winner ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Barring a completely out-of-the-box surprise, that leaves ""Dark Knight,"" ""The Reader,"" Clint Eastwood's fast-gaining ""Gran Torino"" and possibly ""Doubt"" or ""Revolutionary Road"" to battle for the final slot.  Watch who took home the Globes » . O'Neil believes ""Dark Knight,"" the year's top box office draw, has ""an excellent shot"" of making the best-picture list. ""We know that because Oscar voters belong to guilds that have their own awards, 'Dark Knight' has a strong chance,"" he says, noting that the Directors Guild, Producers Guild and Writers Guild have all nominated ""Dark Knight"" for their top awards. Read what EW's Dave Karger has to say about that . ""WALL-E,"" however, is almost certainly out of the best-picture race, he says. Animated features, no matter how successful, have fared poorly in general categories. Indeed, only one animated feature -- 1991's ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- has ever been nominated for best picture. With the addition of the best animated feature category in 2001, it's doubtful that even the best Pixar has to offer will cross over to best picture, particularly since the Academy ignored classics including ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Fantasia"" and ""Toy Story."" ""Oscar voters like reality,"" says O'Neil. Either way, the Oscars could probably use the ratings help a box office success can bring to its broadcast. In recent years, the Academy has nominated several independent or low-budget films for top awards, many of which didn't crack the $100 million mark at the box office. Oscar ratings have tumbled; last year's numbers for ""the Super Bowl for women"" -- as the Oscar broadcast is known by advertisers -- were the lowest on record and a far cry from 1998, when more than 55 million people watched all-time box office king ""Titanic"" take home the top prize. That's not to downgrade the expected front-runners, especially since the Oscars' intention is to honor some of the year's best films and performances (though critics have carped they've often not done so). Still, it might behoove the Academy to pay attention to box office as well as prestige, particularly when several films have garnered both. Almost three-quarters of the respondents to an unscientific USA Today Internet survey have said they'd be more likely to watch the Oscar ceremony February 22 if ""The Dark Knight"" is nominated for best picture. ""If a film is very successful, it shouldn't be automatically relegated to the minor leagues,"" producer Peter Guber told The Associated Press. (Ironically, Guber co-produced the 1989 ""Batman,"" which, despite big box office and Jack Nicholson's Joker, was nominated for just one Oscar -- for Anton Furst's set design. It won.) Historically, summer blockbusters haven't always been ignored. ""Jaws,"" considered the first of the modern summer blockbusters, was nominated for best picture, as were ""Star Wars,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Fugitive."" And there's something to be said for giving visibility to smaller films, says John Martin, president and CEO of Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, an upscale theater chain based in Austin, Texas. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Oscar nominations . ""As an exhibitor, we would love to see those [smaller niche] films make it as well,"" he says. ""They would have legs [box office longevity] if nominated."" Martin, a former film executive, was pleased that ""Slumdog"" and ""The Wrestler"" -- two films his chain got behind -- fared so well at the Golden Globes, and he has high hopes for both films at the Oscars. ""The Wrestler's"" lead, Mickey Rourke, earned a Globe for best dramatic actor, and is now a leading candidate to win best actor at the Oscars. O'Neil sees Rourke as the front-runner in the category, which should be ""a real slugfest,"" he says. ""Milk's"" Sean Penn was considered the early leader, with his main competition ""Frost/Nixon's"" Frank Langella. But now Rourke is in the picture, which could mean trouble for Brad Pitt (""Benjamin Button""), Leonardo DiCaprio (""Revolutionary Road""), Clint Eastwood (""Gran Torino"") and Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"").  Watch Eastwood talk about ""Gran Torino"" » . And Kate Winslet, a double winner at the Globes, could fall between the cracks in the Oscar balloting, O'Neil adds. Other awards let the performers or studios designate whether roles are leading or supporting; the Academy decides on its own, which means that Winslet's performances in ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""The Reader"" could split her support, whether for lead or supporting actress. Heath Ledger should have no such problems. The late actor, whose performance as The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" has been considered Oscar material since the film came out in July, is believed to be a shoo-in for best supporting actor. Ironically, he could be competing against Downey -- 2008's big comeback story -- for a performance as an actor who takes his Method a little too seriously in ""Tropic Thunder."" Though comedies haven't received much nomination recognition, comedic performers have received some recognition, including ""Blazing Saddles' "" Madeline Kahn, ""Heaven Can Wait's"" Dyan Cannon and ""A Fish Called Wanda's"" Kevin Kline, which can't hurt Downey. There's also his personal story, says O'Neil: After drug abuse nearly killed his career, he starred in ""Thunder"" and ""Iron Man,"" two of 2008's biggest hits. ""He's a hopeful spin on the Ledger story,"" O'Neil says. Martin believes Ledger is a lock. ""I wouldn't be surprised if he wins [outright],"" he says. But ""Dark Knight""? Hollywood will have to get past its disdain for ""comic-book movies."" Which, O'Neil says, it should. ""This isn't just a superhero movie,"" says O'Neil. ""It's come to the rescue of Hollywood during a dark time.""",0.6938324,2184
55,"CANNES, France (CNN) -- After eleven days, hundreds of screenings and thousands of snaps from the paparazzi, there could only be one Palme d'Or winner. Austrian director Michael Haneke hugs the president of the Cannes jury, French actress Isabelle Huppert. ""The White Ribbon,"" by Austrian director Michael Haneke, was awarded the prize for its depiction of the cruel punishments meted out at a rural German school before the First World War. ""The Palme d'Or is the best prize a filmmaker can win,"" said Haneke at a press conference following his award. ""I am not proud, but I am very happy. In my opinion, it's silly to be proud."" It was a case of fifth time lucky for Haneke, who has previously been nominated for the award for ""Funny Games"" (1997), ""Code Unknown"" (2000), ""The Piano Teacher"" (2001) and ""Hidden"" (2005). ""There are always rumors at the festival, and one must not take them seriously,"" the director said. ""When I presented ""Hidden"" [in 2005], everyone was telling me I was going to win the Palme. And I didn't get it."" Jury president Isabelle Huppert, the French actress who won the best actress prize at the 2001 festival for ""The Piano Teacher,"" said she was delighted to have the chance to honor her former director. ""I think I always loved him as a director, and that's why I've worked with him before,"" she said at the post-awards press conference. ""To me, the movie is very philosophical. And his style, and his direction are totally ethical in my mind. That's what I wanted to reward."" The American actress Robin Wright Penn, who also sat on the festival jury, laughed off rumors that the decision was hotly disputed. ""There have been rumors circulating that we were fighting in the room,"" she told the press conference. ""The beauty about loving each other ... [is that] we could disagree, and we still love each other. I felt like we built a consensus among us,"" she said. ""It was like being on ""Big Brother,"" except you could go to the movies,"" added British screenwriter and fellow juror Hanif Kureishi. ""Some of the films are very long,"" he joked. Elsewhere, Charlotte Gainsbourg won the best actress prize for her shocking turn in Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist,"" featuring scenes of genital mutilation that left audiences stunned. Christolph Waltz won best actor for his role in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds,"" while Brillante Mendoza secured the best director gong for ""Kinatay.""

56,"(CNN) -- Take a handful of screen goddesses and a clutch of matinee idols, put them together and one thing's sure to happen. Nobody does love like they do in the movies: this month on the Screening Room, we've picked our favorite silver-screen romantic moments. No contest: Bogie and Bergman in undoubtedly the silver screen's top romantic movie moment . From rom-coms to heartbreak, these are the scenes that skip the schmaltz to make us believe that sometimes, Cupid really does get it right. And, just for balance, we've also picked those moments that made us cringe -- or long for a sick-bucket ... Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Post your comments to the Screening Room blog and we'll publish the best. Read other CNN viewers' favorite romantic movie moments, and tell us yours >> . 1. Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) Yep, it's a no-brainer. In a world full of slushy, happily-ever-after rom-coms, Bogie and Bergman find true romance in heartache, sacrificing their romance for the greater good. Bogie's ""hill of beans"" speech still gets us every time. Oh, the tragedy! Still, they'll always have Paris ... 2. City Lights (Charles Chaplin, 1931) Truly, madly sweetly: Blind flower-girl Virginia Cherrill recognizes Chaplin's tramp when she presses a coin into his hand. Deeply moved, as the scale of his sacrifice dawns on her, she wells up -- as did we; his expression shifts from shame to tentative delight. The most touching film moment of all time? 3. Roman Holiday (William Wyler, 1953) Audrey Hepburn's princess falls for Gregory Peck's noble hack (surely that's an oxymoron!) -- but while the ending is bittersweet, it's the playful scene at the Mouth of Truth, with its pitch-perfect comic timing, that captured our hearts. 4. From Here to Eternity (Fred Zinnemann, 1953) ""Nobody ever kissed me the way you do."" Army sergeant Burt Lancaster and troubled wife Deborah Kerr find refuge in their torrid, adulterous affair; the heat between them is tangible. With the tumultuous waves crashing over the embracing couple, Zinnemann creates one of old Hollywood's most iconic images. 5. Amélie (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001) A sheer moment of joy, as Amélie (Audrey Tautou) zooms through Paris on the back of Nino's (Mathieu Kassovitz) bicycle. The laughing couple freewheel down the cobbled streets past Sacré Coeur, filled with the delirious exuberance of new love. Ah, c'est l'amour. 6. Annie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977) The highlight of Woody Allen's confessional masterpiece is Annie's (Diane Keaton) first meeting with Alvy (Allen) at the tennis club where we're blown away by her vitality, ebullient charm and fresh contrast with Allen's wound-up, navel-gazing New Yorker. La-di-da, la-di-da, la la! 7. La Dolce Vita (Federico Fellini, 1960) Fellini's beautifully choreographed tableau in the Trevi Fountain sees young journalist Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni) rendered helpless as buxom screen goddess Sylvia (Anita Eckberg) draws him into her spell. A paean to those fleeting moments between sunset and dawn when reality slips away to reveal something altogether more magical. Talking of which ... 8. Before Sunrise (Richard Linklater, 1995) They've no time for mix-tapes, so Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) head to a record store's music booth to acid-test their compatibility. In its confined space, they nervously avoid each other's eyes, so painfully aware of each other's physical presence. A moment that evokes strong memories of those sweet first-love connections. 9. Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003) Bob (Bill Murray), a movie star well past his sell-by date, and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a neglected newlywed, are two lost souls who are cast adrift, and come together, in Tokyo. Their parting moment, when Bob whispers his secret farewell to Charlotte, is all the more romantic for its mystery. 10. When Harry Met Sally (Rob Reiner, 1989) Forget the orgasm scene in Katz's Deli. Forget the strolls in scenic Central Park. After ninety minutes of vacillating, Harry and Sally have one final bout of verbal sparring before they finally get it together for good. Now that's what we call New Year fireworks. ....................... And our most cringe-worthy moments... Four Weddings and a Funeral (Mike Newell, 1994) Out of the frying pan, into the fire: Hugh Grant escapes Bridezilla to pour his heart out to Andie MacDowell, who utters her painfully corn-dog response: ""Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed."" You could have had Kristin Scott Thomas, you dolt! Howard the Duck (Willard Huyck, 1986) Please, no! Down in B-movie hell, we hid our eyes and winced as lovely Lea Thompson attempted to seduce a rather startled duck-shaped alien. There should be laws against that sort of thing. Wait a minute, there ARE laws against that sort of thing! The English Patient (Anthony Mingella, 1996) ""I've watched you - on verandahs, at garden parties, at the races ... "" Ralph Fiennes turns stalker in Mingella's improbable mush-fest. And don't even start us on the bit where he runs across the desert. As Seinfeld's Elaine says, ""Quit telling your stupid story about the stupid desert and just die already! Die!"" Titanic (James Cameron, 1997) Timeless romance? We think not. As Leo slips away, Kate Winslet's star-crossed lover cries, ""I'll never let go, Jack. I promise."" And then does -- scurrying as quickly as her hands will paddle her to the safety of a lifeboat, a warm blanket and a nice cup of tea. Ah, the relief. Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones (George Lucas, 2002) ""I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life."" Any scene featuring Hayden Christensen's moody teen has us wincing, but he's most awkwardly shown up against Natalie Portman, who struggles nobly through Lucas' plodding love-lines. Georgie, please, leave out the romance. We're begging you. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Sound off and read others' thoughts in the Screening Room blog. E-mail to a friend .",0.69238377,3075
57,"(CNN) -- Holly Hunter doesn't take roles based on what she thinks viewers want to see. Holly Hunter plays a tough detective grappling with issues of faith in TNT's ""Saving Grace."" ""I have, frankly, very few expectations when it comes to audience,"" the acclaimed actress said. ""I've done features, I've done stage and I've done television movies."" ""I'm used to having the experience of perhaps missing an audience where your feature, for some reason or another, may not have a large audience, while some of my features have found large audiences, so I am used to both. My expectations are adaptable and they are low."" Hunter need not worry, because she has a hit on her hands with TNT's ""Saving Grace,"" which is soon to debut its third season. The television drama follows the decidedly messy life of Oklahoma City Police Detective Grace Hanadarko, who lives and works hard while being shadowed by a no-nonsense angel. The premise may sound unusual, but it is just that originality that attracted Hunter, an Academy Award winner whose eclectic career has included projects as varied as the films ""Raising Arizona,"" ""Broadcast News"" and the animated ""The Incredibles.""  See the significant roles Hunter has played » . The actress said she continues to be attracted to playing Hanadarko because it allows her to explore emotions and attitudes that a lot of roles these days simply aren't offering. ""She wants to have conversations about sex, she wants to have conversations about faith,"" Hunter said. ""She is very comfortable with the darkness in herself and with the darkness in others and I want to talk about that. There are not a lot of opportunities to have that conversation in features."" It isn't surprising that Hunter was able to find such a rich, creative playground at TNT. The network (which is owned by the parent company of CNN) has carved a niche for itself as a destination for critically acclaimed and popular dramas. That reputation has been strengthened by the popularity of shows like Hunter's as well as the program many credit with raising TNT's game, ""The Closer."" That show's fifth season kick's off the network's summer schedule on June 8. Star Kyra Sedgwick said Deputy Police Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson is in for some changes now that she's married -- though she will maintain the edge that fans have come to love. ""I think the character continues to be great at her job and struggles in her personal life and issues surrounding the possibility of having children come up,"" said Sedgwick. ""I think it's hard for someone who sees a lot of darkness in the world and deals with the darkest part of humanity to believe in the benevolence of the universe and the safety of a world to bring kids into."" Like Hunter, Sedgwick said she loves playing such a strong character. That esteem, and flexibility of working on a cable series, which demands less of a time commitment than a network show, has made it easier to be on an opposite coast from her husband, Kevin Bacon, and their children, Sedgwick said. ""I was very clear on not wanting to give up any other part of my career,"" said Sedgwick, who this season also serves as the show's executive producer. ""By doing the show, I think it has opened up more in the way of feature films for me."" Mark-Paul Gosselaar couldn't agree with Sedgwick more. His series, ""Raising the Bar,"" will be back on TNT for a second season and the actor said he appreciates being part of a network that values drama. His role as public defender Jerry Kellerman in the courtroom drama is a continuation of the actor's long-time collaborative relationship with Emmy-winning producer Steven Bochco. ""I've been fortunate enough, for close to the last decade, to work with one of the most prolific producers in this genre,"" said Gosselaar, who also had roles on Bochco's ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Commander-in-Chief."" ""I couldn't be in a better situation than to have attached myself to a man who is willing to give me these roles and is one of my biggest supporters."" The character of Kellerman is so earnest and passionately idealistic that he might remind some of an adult version of another character who first made Gosselaar famous -- Zack Morris on the teen sitcom ""Saved By the Bell."" It's a role Gosselaar said he has no desire to escape, even after all these years. ""Zack has been something that has made such an impact on people and I am proud that I was able to do that,"" said Gosselaar, who hinted that a long-desired reunion of the show's cast is in the works. ""When I was doing the show, it was almost like some people were closet 'Saved By the Bell' watchers and now it's become this iconic thing, so it's fun."" Gosselaar said ""Raising the Bar"" is a different type of courtroom drama, where viewers are able to witness the lives a different type of attorney. ""I don't think we have ever seen a show that deals with this side of the criminal justice system,"" he said. ""We've seen the cops and the prosecutors, but 'Raising the Bar' gives voice to the public defenders and their clients, who you almost never hear from."" His is not the only TNT show that is giving the audience something different. Hunter said her show will continue to explore substantive themes. ""This season is a real investigation of beliefs and what does it mean to believe as opposed to what it means to know,"" Hunter said. ""It's a large question and many people have different answers. This show is exploring a more global idea of who God is to each of us."" Also Included in TNT's summer schedule are the heist drama ""Leverage"" starring Timothy Hutton, which premiers its second season and new show ""Hawthorne,"" which stars Jada Pinkett Smith as a single mom and the director of nursing at a North Carolina hospital.",0.69137913,6274
58,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A blossoming of cinematic creativity has swept Argentina in recent years, bringing about a second golden age of film. Pablo Trapero's latest movie ""Lion's Den"" stars Martina Gusman (left) and was in competition at Cannes. In Argentina, the renaissance marks a return to form for a cinematic tradition that was prolific and highly successful until creativity was stifled by a succession of military regimes that began with the ascendancy of Juan Peron in the 1940s. A revival occurred after the country returned to democracy in 1983 as filmmakers focused on life under the military dictatorship -- Luiz Puenzo's ""The Official Story"" (1985) won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. But an economic malaise ensued, turning off the taps to film financing. An economic boom in the 1990s quickly turned unstable, resulting in a crippling financial crisis earlier this decade that plunged Argentina into its worst recession ever. Out of the chaos, a new group of Argentina filmmakers emerged. The leaders of the so-called ""New Argentine Cinema"" have become critical contributors to the wider Latin American film movement that has captivated international critics and audiences alike. What's fueling New Argentine Cinema? Argentina's economy has recovered remarkably since its collapse in 2001, and the national film institute, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), has been keen to foster the industry's development. The combination of cheap production costs and a flourishing artistic community has made Buenos Aires a hub of creativity. Already one of the most cosmopolitan cities in South America, the city is attracting everyone from local bohemians to big Hollywood names. Francis Ford Coppola, the most recent notable to tap into the vibrant scene, opened an Argentine unit of his Zoetrope production company last year to film his Buenos Aires-set family drama ""Tetro,"" which is anticipated to be released next year. What movies are creating buzz? Pablo Trapero's ""Lion's Den"" about a woman who gives birth and raises her child in prison was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year. Trapero is best known for his depiction of ordinary people. He gained acclaim with ""Crane World"" (1999) -- a gritty look at Argentina's working class -- and is widely considered one of Argentina's leading directors. Also in competition at Cannes this year was ""The Headless Woman"" from the ever subtle Lucrecia Martel. The film focuses on a woman's guilt after a hit-and-run accident and like Martel's other works, offers up a dose of social criticism. Martel burst on the scene with her first movie ""The Swamp"" (2001), winner of the Alfred Bauer Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Lucia Puenzo stirred debate with ""XXY"" (2007), an exploration of adolescent sexuality centered around the life of a teenage hermaphrodite. The daughter of award-winning Luiz Puenzo, Lucia took home the Critic Weeks Grand Prize at Cannes last year. Are you excited about Argentine cinema? What is your favorite movie or director? Enough with the dramas -- who makes Argentines laugh? Daniel Burman has cited Woody Allen as one of the auteurs he most admires, and the influence is quite clear in his work, in which his identity as a Jew in Argentina figures prominently. ""Waiting for the Messiah"" (2000), ""Lost Embrace"" (2004) and ""Family Law"" (2006) make up the trilogy of films about fatherhood for which he has gained praise. The young director's latest film ""Empty Nest"" (2008) takes a touching and comedic look at married life. What's this I hear about a Hollywood in Argentina? You're referring to Palermo Hollywood. No, it's not a Las Vegas casino but rather a neighborhood in Buenos Aires where many film and TV studios are based. A bohemian spirit distinguishes the neighborhood from its more polished cousin to the south, Palermo Soho. Once occupied by desolate factories and warehouses, the area is now humming with activity. An abundance of hip lounges, cafes and trendy restaurants keep the buzz going all day and through the night. How does Argentina figure in the Latin American film scene? As the Latin American film renaissance has gained stride, filmmakers across the region have become more interested in collaborating on projects. The end of military dictatorships which ruled Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s ""created really interesting national cinemas that blossomed a little bit everywhere but also created a correlation between directors from different countries,"" Brazilian director Walter Salles told CNN earlier this year. Salles works frequently with Argentine directors. He co-produced Trapero's ""Lion's Den"" and Julia Solomonoff's ""Sisters"" (2005). Meanwhile, Eduardo Constantini Jr, of the philanthropic Constantini family in Argentina, recently launched a fund with the Weinstein Co. aimed at backing Latin American movies. He is also behind The Auteurs, an ""online movie theater"" where Web users can watch and discuss film. Is this boom going to run out of steam? The renaissance in Argentina has been building for some time, but it's only just hitting its stride now. Earlier films were mainly art house successes but now with the spotlight shining on Latin America cinema, Argentine films may start to connect more with international audiences. The country continues to attract productions, and there is a vast pool of talent that is being groomed to lead the next generation of auteurs. More than 12,000 undergraduates are currently studying film directing, scriptwriting and technical production, according to the INCAA. Five other must-see Argentine films . 1. ""The Night of the Pencils"" (Hector Olivera, 1986) 2. ""Nine Queens"" (Fabian Bielinsky, 2000) 3. ""Son of the Bride"" (Juan Jose Campanella, 2001) 4. ""The Dog"" (Carlos Sorin, 2004) 5. ""The Holy Girl"" (Lucrecia Martel, 2004)",0.69128513,4932

CNN's Jay Kernis reports on what it was like inside the Kodak Theatre at the Academy Awards. Hugh Jackman, the host of the 81st Academy Awards, speaks to the audience at the Kodak Theatre on Sunday. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When you're at home, you can sit back and be critical. When you're inside the theater, the whole show seems to work, especially the big production numbers. Maybe it was a particularly well-produced show this year, but when you're in the audience, you feel part of it -- even way up in the second mezzanine. I've been at the Oscars to cover them, but this is the first time I've ever been inside the ceremonies. I was there with my 17-year-old son, Noah. When you arrive on the red carpet, you enter a security tent and show your ticket and driver's license. You notice that the tent is bisected by red velvet ropes and, with a friendly and practiced technique, celebrities are moved to the left of the rope and others to the right. This way, celebs leave the tent closer to the cameras and the fantasy that you might have that everybody in a gown or tux are somehow equals on one night sort of disappears.

The show was best when it demonstrated that Hollywood can still do what it has always done well: getting your attention and holding it -- seeing five Best Actors presenting Oscars on the same stage was pretty amazing. So is Best Actor Sean Penn's self-awareness. The Oscars can still astonish: They still know how to put on the big musical number, with a hundred dancing performers in top hats, moving with Busby Berkeley precision. They still know how to break your heart: Heath Ledger's parents and sister received his Academy Award and said that they did so in celebration. But I bet they'd rather have had him accept it. And for all of the breathtaking special effects that Hollywood can muster, for all the star power in the theater last night, there was something remarkable about seeing Philippe Petit in person -- the wire walker who, in 1974, hovered between the World Trade Center towers for 45 minutes. There was something joyous about watching him balance an Oscar statue on his chin.",0.6912029,2150
60,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Punctuation promises comedy in ""The Informant!"" as if the title subject is a cartoon secret agent -- maybe Agent 86 in ""Get Smart."" Matt Damon, as a corporate turncoat, offers up secrets in ""The Informant!"" But he's not. The whistle-blower worthy of an exclamation point in this groovy-looking, chuckle-baiting, fact-based movie from protean director Steven Soderbergh is Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), a biochemist and well-placed executive at the agri-processing giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in Decatur, Illinois. It's the early 1990s. The company man is helping expose ADM's alleged global price-fixing activities to the FBI, cooperating with the feds long enough to gather invaluable evidence. But what Whitacre doesn't confide to his FBI handlers, and what his wheat-colored jackets, Dilbert ties, and weakling mustache hide, at least at first, is that this inside source is not completely trustworthy. Damon, fattened up to fit his boxy suits, wears Whitacre's slack demeanor beautifully. The star -- who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor -- is in nimble control as he reveals his character's deep crazies.  Watch why Damon gained 30 pounds for the role » . Soderbergh's amused study of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history is adapted from ""The Informant: A True Story,"" an amazing, deeply reported book by New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald. That book told the story without editorial eye-rolling. But somewhere between Eichenwald's journalistic attention to detail and the bubbly, dialogue-besotted script by ""The Bourne Ultimatum's"" Scott Z. Burns, Soderbergh has chosen to apply an attitude of arch whoopee, a greasy veneer of mirth over what is, no joke, a serious mess of malfeasance and mental instability. It's tempting to laugh, but what's the joke: Whitacre? ADM? The FBI? The fashion trends of Decatur? Smarty condescension lurks behind the suburban bushes. Had a '90s date and place card not been supplied, I would have remained in an honest muddle about the era depicted on screen. And since Whitacre is subliminally likened to bumbling, fictional Maxwell Smart, that's probably as the filmmaker intended. The artistic choice is reinforced by a '70s-era ""Laugh-In"" aesthetic seen in everything from the smiley yellow novelty typography of the opening credits to the fancy rubber-chicken music served up in heaps of horns and whistles by essence-of-'70s composer Marvin Hamlisch. Sock it to me. Playing it straight and letting his Sam-Donaldson-meets-Spock hairdo suggest otherwise, Scott Bakula makes an appealing FBI agent with a deadpan grimace just this side -- or maybe it's the other side -- of ""Dragnet's"" Joe Friday. Comedian Joel McHale from E!'s ""The Soup"" plays the fellow agent who stares with big round eyes while his partner squints at Whitacre's successive leakages of truth/lie/ truth/lie. The always wonderful, huggable Melanie Lynskey, who stole the show in ""Away We Go,"" does more great wifely work as Ginger Whitacre, her husband's biggest booster. A valued subset of Soderbergh's audience is sure to dig iconic hipster comic brothers Tom and Dick Smothers in small roles. In fact, the wily pair would fit right in with an ""Ocean's Whatever"" cast of coolios, enjoying some retro-style ensemble fun, regardless of whether the audience does. Soderbergh is as smart, stylish, and attentive a filmmaker as they come. And there are moments in ""The Informant!"" when I can almost be convinced that the tonal feints he establishes at the intersection of joke and no-joke are seriously, thoughtfully meant to replicate the misaligned synapses in Whitacre's own head. iReport.com: Damon's latest worth checking out . But if that's the intention, Soderbergh ultimately made the choice to abandon interesting, dispassionate empathy for the more quick-fix payoff of amusement. As Whitacre goes through his days, Damon recites interior monologues of distracted observation in voice-overs meant to demonstrate how his character's unusual brain works. In ""The Informant!"", that brain -- screwy and yet capable of doing important undercover work -- free-associates like Ellen DeGeneres on a swing through Walmart. Cute, but as even Agent 86 would say in ""Get Smart"": Missed it by that much. EW Grade: B . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

61,"(CNN) -- Humiliation and comedy have always been natural bedfellows, but the one doesn't guarantee the other, as poor Katherine Heigl discovers in this crude, sub-par stab at a modern screwball comedy. Katherine Heigl plays the sophisticated female boss of Gerard Butler in ""The Ugly Truth."" The ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Knocked Up"" star plays Abby, a supposedly intelligent producer on a local Sacramento TV news show. We're repeatedly assured that she's good at her job, though there's little or no evidence for that in what we see, and apparently the ratings are in the toilet. That's why her boss drafts controversial cable clown Mike (Gerard Butler), whose bargain basement show ""The Ugly Truth"" gives viewers the real dope on the opposite sex. Mike's straight talk isn't exactly edifying -- or original. It boils down to this: men are only interested in one thing, and it's not your IQ score. His advice to women: swallow your pride -- and anything else that might come up. Abby is understandably skeptical, both professionally and personally, but the sweeps prove her wrong. Mike may be outrageous, but Sacramento loves him for it. A smarter comedy might make mischief from these base ingredients, the sophisticated female boss and her rude, reactionary star employee. But this movie, which is credited to three female screenwriters, bends over backward to accommodate Mike's tired old sexist world view and fails to be funny in the process. Abby really is a neurotic control freak, living alone with her cat and a checklist about what constitutes the perfect guy. And when a close approximation of the type moves in right next door (Eric Winton as a handsome young doctor), she only lands him by putting herself in Mike's hands: accentuating her cleavage, losing the ponytail and trading in dinner and an art show for a hot dog and a baseball game. Directed by Robert Luketic (""Monster in Law""), ""The Ugly Truth"" barely attempts to disguise its own lifts and tucks. The most craven of these gambits involves Abby going into multiple orgasm at a business dinner, a variation on Meg Ryan's famous scene in ""When Harry Met Sally,"" except that in Ryan's case, she was in full control, demonstrating her mastery of the fake-out. Abby, though, is sent into inadvertent paroxysms when the remote control of the vibrating panties she's wearing -- don't ask -- falls into the hands of a curious kid.  Watch the stars describe the scene » . In other scenes, Heigl is caught hanging upside down from a tree in her nightgown, hiding in her office closet and furiously rubbing a stain out of the doctor's crotch in front of a stadium of ball fans. Presumably this is what picking up Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock's cast-offs entails these days. Katharine Hepburn would weep. But what about Mike? Surely he has lessons to learn and comic indignities to endure? Not so much. In contrast to Abby's makeover, he's allowed to be comfortable in his own rather corpulent skin. Gerard Butler evidently hasn't worked out since Sparta; heck, he hasn't even bothered to shave. You won't be surprised that the avowed bachelor boy falls in love with dear Abby. Of course he's a nice guy underneath. We know that from the way he looks out for his fatherless nephew. So what if he's a sexist pig? He's a sexy sexist pig, and obviously father material. What more could any woman want? ""The Ugly Truth"" is rated R and runs 97 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's review, click here.",0.6910924,5314

63,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- ""The Time Traveler's Wife,"" adapted from the 2003 best-seller by Audrey Niffenegger, is one of those gooey romantic mind-benders, like ""Ghost"" (which I adored) or ""The Lake House"" (not so much), in which a couple must come to grips with some trippy impediment to their relationship, such as life after death or a hole in the space-time continuum. Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana star as a couple trying to connect in ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Only instead of being milked for elaborate science-fiction thrills, the problem at hand gets treated as a weepy and grandiose inconvenience. Sort of like the metaphysical version of having a husband who takes too many business trips. Henry (Eric Bana) is deeply, and eternally, in love with Clare (Rachel McAdams), and she with him. The only problem is that he has a ""genetic anomaly"" that causes him to skip around through time without warning. All of a sudden, he will melt out of the present and pop up ... somewhere else, in the future or in the past, without a stitch of clothing on, so that he must scramble for cover and regain his bearings. Then, just as suddenly, he'll pop back into Clare's life -- sometimes when he's too young a man to have any idea who she is. (A little confused? So was I.) More jarringly, he sometimes appears when he's an adult and she's an adoring young girl standing in a pastoral meadow. That's when she falls in love with him -- which is meant to be innocent, but comes off as a bit unintentionally creepy. I mean, is the movie supposed to look like a contemporary version of ""The Lewis Carroll Story""? To muddle matters further, Henry is seen at assorted ages, but except for the moment when he shows up at his wedding with sudden streaks of gray in his hair, Bana looks exactly the same in every scene. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is built as a game that the audience learns to play, and after a while, yes, we do get the hang of it. That is, we accept the film's mixture of the playful and the slightly arbitrary; we become romantic time travelers too. Although the script is by Bruce Joel Rubin, who wrote ""Ghost,"" the film's mood doesn't change very much; it's gentle, wistful, gauzy, and placid. Bana, so fantastic in ""Munich,"" has always had to work overtime to prove that an actor who looks like the Aussie gym-rat version of Rodin's ""The Thinker"" can play a gentle, unassuming regular guy. But he does nicely here. He and McAdams are sweet together, with matching dimples and starry eyes, and we grow eager to see them remain in the same place. In the end, that's all there is to the movie, really. It's a time-travel fantasy in search of a cozy love seat. EW Grade: B-minus . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

65,"(CNN)  -- In the same way a Christmas playlist is incomplete without a tipsy, eggnog-drinking grandmother having an unfortunate accident with reindeer, the melodrama of certain shows and films improves when a boozy grandmother is written in. The minor role is normally reserved for television, but it makes the jump to movie theaters this year in ""The Lovely Bones,"" Peter Jackson's cerebral thriller based on Alice Sebold's 2002 novel, with Susan Sarandon playing the hard-drinking Grandma Lynn. ""She's such a strange grandmother,"" Sarandon told the Australian press about her first role as a family matriarch. Although Sarandon, 63, said she's old enough to play one, her Grandma Lynn isn't ""a granny grandmother."" ""She's the comic relief in this very deep, very hard movie; she comes in and the movie gets lighter,"" said movie reviewer Kit Bowen. ""She's trying to vacuum while ash is falling from her cigarette."" Television critics say it's hard to nail down when this character first made an appearance, but the anti-grandmother role we know today was more than likely inspired by the spirited older women on ""Golden Girls,"" and has since become a television staple. Kelly Bishop played a version of the difficult, drinking grandmother for seven seasons as Emily Gilmore on ""Gilmore Girls,"" and Holland Taylor has taken her vodka neat as Evelyn Harper on ""Two and a Half Men"" and as Peggy Peabody on ""The L Word."" The Upper East Side hour-long melodrama ""Gossip Girl"" has the scheming Celia Rhodes -- whose signature scent is Chanel No. 5 with a top note of gin -- and Jessica Walter has perfected the role as Lucille Bluth on ""Arrested Development"" and Tabitha Wilson on ""90210."" ""These women, they're not knitting -- they're more interested in mixing their drinks than watching kids,"" said Entertainment Weekly's pop culture writer Tim Stack. ""They're more inclined to offer a witticism or a barb than to give you sweet advice. These ladies aren't cooking -- I don't think they even eat. They drink their lunch. And their dinners. And their breakfasts. ... Maybe they eat the olives."" They're the exact opposite of the stereotypical grandmother, said TVGuide.com's senior editor Mickey O'Connor. ""They're supposed to be the truth-tellers -- whether it's liquid courage or lowering their inhibitions, I don't know,"" O'Connor said. ""But everyone can relate to having an older relative that embarrasses you to some degree,"" he added. ""Shelley Long just did a drunken grandma on 'Modern Family.' There was a wedding scene where she got drunk, gave a toast and ended up kicking the cake over. It's about the universality of how we deal with our older relatives. If you make them drunk, there's some way to at least codify what embarrasses us about them, or to excuse their outrageous behavior."" With O'Connor's own grandparents, though, ""it's less often an indication of how much they've had to drink and more often just who they are."" Because it's a role that's virtually paint-by-numbers -- drunk grandmothers are nearly always wealthy, white and cruelly witty, with poor parenting skills -- it demands a strong actress who can keep the potentially two-dimensional from falling flat. Case in point for film reviewer Bowen is the difference between the Grandma Lynn in Sebold's novel and Jackson's cinematic version. ""I loved the book, but the funny thing is that I don't remember the grandmother,"" Bowen said. ""She definitely is more memorable in the movie, and I'm glad her character is in the movie because it adds another layer to it. ""Which, of course, has everything to do with Susan Sarandon,"" Bowen added. The talent of the women who have taken these minor roles and turned them into iconic characters is what has kept the ""drunk grandma"" role from veering into cliché territory, O'Connor said. ""Even with the criticisms people had of '90210,' they liked Jessica Walter and what she was doing,"" O'Connor said. ""She brought some reality. The teen drama tends to be a little stylized in terms of its emotional truth, and she's kind of there to cut through the artifice."" Stack, who also lists Walter's ""Development"" character as one of his favorites, thinks these roles are always such a hit because, regardless of what series they land in, they always manage to ""punch it up."" (Need proof of Walter's comedic timing? Do a search for ""Lucille Bluth Chicken Dance"" on YouTube.) ""They're the Tabasco to a Bloody Mary,"" Stack said. ""Walter was sharp, funny, mean and heartless --- and at the same time, she was fabulous in a Chanel suit like it was always happy hour somewhere. She made it look like such a blast."" While their alcohol-induced shenanigans are obviously trumped up for comedic effect, the idea of a grandmother who's independent, technologically savvy and having fun isn't the foreign notion it used to be, said Mary McHugh, the 81-year-old author of ""How Not to Become a Little Old Lady."" McHugh herself has spent her post-child-rearing years traveling the world. ""When people think of a grandmother, their eyes glaze over. But now, many of us are doing things we love doing. We're not sitting somewhere and rocking in a rocking chair,"" said McHugh, who herself enjoys a glass of wine or two to cap off her evenings. But, despite the truth that these characters are reflected in the real world more than ever, television and film still doesn't have anything close to the godmother of the grandmother character, ""Golden Girls."" ""Hopefully, it's not the drunk grandmother [character] that have made it better for older actresses, but you never know,"" O'Connor said. ""Maybe it's become, play a drunk grandmother and you get to work past the age of 60.""",0.6875265,8478

67,"(CNN) -- You may have noticed: Clint Eastwood has become respectable in his old age. ""Gran Torino,"" says Tom Charity, is all about Clint Eastwood. And that's a great thing. To judge by the release pattern and some of the more reverent reviews, you would think the 78-year-old director's second movie of the season (after ""Changeling"") was another prestige picture with Oscar firmly in its sights, along the lines of ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" Nominations may be forthcoming, or they may not (we'll find out January 22), but trust me, ""Gran Torino"" is not that kind of animal. It's a crude but pungent stab at popular filmmaking, blue-collar and bare-knuckle. Which is not to say it's disappointing. On the contrary, it's an entertaining star vehicle that does its job well. Other films around right now tackle ""important"" themes -- the Holocaust, justice, alienation -- but ""Gran Torino"" is all about Clint: the suspicious squint, granite composure and bad-ass attitude. Is Eastwood important? If you have grown up with this enduring American icon, there's no question about it. Apparently Nick Schenk's screenplay wasn't written specifically for him, but after seeing the film it's impossible to imagine it with anyone else. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is a Korean War veteran and retired auto worker, a grumpy old man and the last white guy holding on to his property in an inner-city neighborhood that's been taken over by Asian-Americans. The movie opens at his wife's funeral. (How many times have we seen Eastwood with a wife on screen? Not too often.) Walt's not happy, of course, but more than anything, he seems pissed off. His kids are a sore disappointment. The grandkids merit nothing more than a growl. At the wake, even the priest, Father Janovich (freckle-faced Christopher Carley), is quickly shown the door. Walt is alone now, and he means to keep it that way. He sits on a deck chair out on his front porch, a cooler of beer beside him, the American flag hanging limp over his square patch of lawn. It's a portrait of implacable American isolationism -- until the teenage son of his Hmong next-door neighbor encroaches on Walt's turf. Thao (Bee Vang) nearly gets his head blown off trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino. To apologize, and to thank the white guy for stepping in to save him from the gangbangers who put him up to the stunt, Thao reluctantly reports for a week of whatever chores Walt might ask of him. The grudging mutual respect that develops between them is entirely predictable, but in Eastwood's clean, unfussy but discreetly patient direction, even a banal task -- like wrestling an old fridge out of the basement -- assumes the bonding power Alan Ladd and Van Heflin found in digging out a stubborn tree stump in ""Shane."" Like other Eastwood heroes before him, Walt sacrifices his independence by accepting that others depend on him. The relationship is also laced with plenty of gruff humor. If you're feeling indulgent, the film has almost as many laughs as a comedy. The older man introduces Thao to his barber (John Carroll Lynch) for a lesson in guy talk -- which turns out to be the art of barking invective with impunity. (PC, it's not.) Meanwhile, Walt's own racist (Archie) Bunker mentality thaws when Thao's self-assured sister Sue (Ahney Her) introduces him to the pleasures of Thai food. All the while, the neighborhood punks hover in the background, waiting for the right moment to test whether Dirty Old Harry is firing anything more than blanks these days. Schenk's screenplay isn't subtle, and some of the young cast struggle to camouflage its crudeness, but Eastwood revels in the pragmatic design and roughneck humor of the piece. Walt may be a dinosaur, but he carries a big footprint. In a similar way, ""Gran Torino"" is no classic, but at least it's a star vehicle worthy of a true legend. ""Gran Torino"" is rated R and runs 116 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.",0.6870419,2698
68,"LONDON, England (CNN) --     Editor's note: Watch Tarantino talking about the making of ""Pulp Fiction"" on The Screening Room podcast. To receive regular movie podcasts subscribe here. Quentin Tarantino's first trip to Sundance wasn't exactly a success. Tarantino's hyper-violent, super cool debut feature ""Reservoir Dogs"" scorched audiences and critics alike when it came out in 1992. ""If you do this in real life, they're going to fire your ass,"" scolded cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, veteran of films like ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War."" The novice filmmaker was participating in a directors' workshop at the Sundance Institute -- the film trust founded by Robert Redford which also runs the Sundance Film Festival. Unfortunately, Tarantino's mentors were just not feeling his experimental approach. The following week, a new group of mentors arrived, including ex-Monty Python member and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Tarantino and his editor steeled themselves for the inevitable disapproval: ""Then Terry Gilliam comes in and goes 'Oh, your scene. Just great!'"" recalls the director. He is talking at the Cannes Film Festival Cinema Masterclass, following in the illustrious footsteps of directors like Wong Kar Wai, Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese. ""It was just like, you know what, that's gonna be my career. People are gonna either really like me or they're really not and just get f***ing used to it 'cause this is the deal,"" Tarantino says. A second visit to Sundance in 1992 proved more fruitful. His debut feature, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" a sassy, hyper-violent gangster movie, was the hit of the year. French film critic and regular on the European film festival circuit, Michel Ciment still remembers the effect it had on him when it showed at Cannes later that year: ""It was a big shock. I remember it was the most striking new American film since 'Mean Streets' 30 years before."" Despite the impact of his droll, assured debut, Tarantino recalls being convinced he was going to get fired in the first two weeks of production. ""I just thought it was too good to be true. I couldn't help but think something like 'they don't let people like me make movies,'"" he says, laughing. Follow-up movie ""Pulp Fiction"" was awarded the coveted Palm D'Or at Cannes two years later, cementing his reputation as a movie-maker to be reckoned with. It was filled with the dark humor and bloody violence that would become known as Tarantino trademarks. The B-movie-obsessed director admits to getting a kick out of creating humor in inappropriate situations. ""I'm trying to get you to laugh at things you've never laughed at before,"" he explains. He cites his ""bigtime"" influences as movie brats like Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, as well as Sergio Leone and Howard Hawks. In person, he is a great raconteur and his expletive-littered speech is not a million miles away from the dialogue that's so central to his movies. ""I tend to think of myself as more of a novelist who makes movies than a director per se,"" he declares. But he dismisses his apparent love of language as a product of writing for acting classes: ""I started writing as an actor and it was all about dialogue and writing scenes to do."" Before moving into directing, Tarantino studied acting for six years and says learning to act for the camera gave him an insight into how directors put a movie together -- frame by frame. That was what really taught him how to write for the movies. ""All of a sudden I started seeing [film] in a whole different way. When you start doing that, then it's only a few short steps until you start composing shots of your own,"" he explains. Tarantino has shown himself to be one of the most music-savvy directors of this generation with his use of songs like ""Little Green Bag"" by the George Baker Selection in the opening sequence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1."" He, not immodestly, puts that skill down to his great music collection. ""The thing is, I have one of the best soundtrack collections in America,"" he boasts. That probably accounts for his scathing determination never to use film composers: ""I don't trust any composers to do it. I would just never give anybody that kind of responsibility,"" he says, ""Who the f*** is this guy coming in here, throwing their s*** all over my movie?"" And he admits that his inner film buff enjoys the cornerstones of action cinema that some of his later movies have explored. ""I love action scenes, but they are hard, and in a way that's what's fun about them. These cool little puzzles. To me, action scenes are some of the most cinematic moments that you can do in film,"" he says. ""Kill Bill Vol. One"" and ""Kill Bill Vol. Two,"" starring Tarantino muse and Hollywood A-lister Uma Thurman, are his movie-geek nod to the kung fu genre. When he started filming ""Vol. One,"" Tarantino hadn't made a film for six years and with typical chutzpah challenged himself to choreograph astonishingly intricate fight scenes. ""If I throw my hat in the ring with the greatest action directors who ever lived ... I wanna be as good as them,"" he asserts. He continues to work his way through his action movie checklist. In his latest movie, ""Death Proof,"" a homage to sleazy 70s B-movies that stars Kurt Russell as a murderous stuntman, he puts his own spin on another of action film's fundamentals -- the car chase. Tarantino is critical of CGI being used so much in film today. All the seat-grippingly tense stunts in ""Death Proof"" are real and he specifically cast a stuntwoman, Zoe Bell, in one of the leading roles to achieve this. It may have been ambitious, but ""Death Proof,"" which is one half of ""Grindhouse,"" a B-movie-referencing double bill he made with fellow director Robert Rodriguez, got a critical mauling and didn't fare much better at the box office. But then Tarantino has long been resigned to people either loving or hating his movies.",0.68655926,3059
69,"(CNN) -- Early in Michael Mann's vivid, incisive, but half-cocked gangster opus ""Public Enemies,"" Johnny Depp's John Dillinger returns to jail a few scant months after leaving it. Johnny Depp plays the charismatic John Dillinger in ""Public Enemies."" Only this time he's just visiting -- and he's taking his friends out with him. It's an audacious opening gambit, and when the getaway gets messy -- one of the gang panics and soon bullets are flying all over the place -- we glimpse another insight into what makes Dillinger tick. As he clings to a wounded comrade for dear life, and stares death long in the face, he has to make a decision: What to do with the guy who panicked and brought this upon them? Dillinger lets him go. Based on Bryan Burrough's well-sourced account of the Depression-era crime wave that gave rise not only to Dillinger, but also to a whole gallery of criminal poster boys -- Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the Barker gang, Bonnie and Clyde -- ""Public Enemies"" whittles the book down to its most dramatic duel: the nationwide manhunt for Dillinger presided over by J. Edgar Hoover (a knockout Billy Crudup) and led by his Chicago, Illinois, bureau chief, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Dillinger and Purvis assumed folk-hero proportions in their day. According to Burrough, when newsreels showed Dillinger -- public enemy No. 1 -- he was applauded more loudly than the president. A 20th-century Jesse James, he was an underdog with a reputation for fairness. It was said he never killed anybody, and he was gallant and jocular with members of the public, once offering his overcoat to a kidnapped bank teller he had taken as a human shield. The role is tailor-made for a self-styled rebel like Depp. He understands the outlaw's swagger, the ferocity that sits hand in glove with his soft-spoken sensitivity. All the romance in the picture comes from Depp: the graceful ease with which he vaults a bank railing, his astonishing self-confidence and his dedicated courtship of hat-check girl Billie Frechette (an eager Marion Cotillard). She's swept up less by the high life he promises than the passionate conviction of his pitch. Burrough paints Purvis as an ineffectual, even inept agent who was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to nab Floyd, Nelson and Dillinger. The movie has no truck with such revisionism, but betrays little interest in Bale's dour, narrow lawman. The film's parallel cop-and-robber structure recalls Mann's modern classic, ""Heat."" Purvis and Dillinger meet only once -- to talk -- and then face off just once more, at the climax, to kill and be killed. If the confrontation of Bale and Depp doesn't pack the same iconic punch as ""Heat's"" Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, the (entirely fictitious) exchange in a Midwestern jail cell remains central to the film. At one point, Dillinger reprimands Purvis for shooting down Pretty Boy Floyd, extending the poetic license still further -- as a point of historical fact Floyd died several months after Dillinger, and though Purvis was at the scene he almost certainly didn't pull the trigger. But Purvis did coordinate the execution of John Dillinger, an assassination as much as it was an attempted arrest, and maybe the nastiest crime in the picture. So when the incarcerated Depp advises the smug Bale that he should find a different line of work for his own peace of mind, his words carry a certain weight. Still, the movie's resolve to take Dillinger at face value feels a bit perfunctory, even old hat. At 140 minutes it takes a long time to find its rhythm; indeed, this is one film that would be better if it were 20 minutes longer. Still, there's little here that Arthur Penn didn't anticipate 40 years ago in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" except maybe the intriguing idea that organized crime pulled the plug on the old-style go-it-alone bank robber in a belated attempt to forestall Hoover's dream of a federal law enforcement agency. For all its loving period detail, the movie scarcely notices the desperate poverty of the times. Shot largely on high definition video, ""Public Enemies"" doesn't look like the old gangster films -- it looks like TV. The images gain in immediacy what is lost in luster, but left this spectator looking for more texture, more depth -- more heat. iReport.com: Depp's best film? One of the new Hollywood's last great stylists, Mann is well aware of the sacrifice involved in this transition. You can see it in the loving way he pictures Johnny Depp's doomed Dillinger watching Clark Gable's doomed gangster embrace his fate in ""Manhattan Melodrama"" while Purvis and his deputies assume their places outside Chicago's Biograph Theater. There is something ritualistic about this sequence, as if Dillinger divines some measure of grace from the screen, and we congregants also play our part. The faces change, but it's the same old movie we remember.",0.68589026,4981
70,"Tukwila, WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Dude was in the house. Winners of the Seattle Lebowski Fest best-costume prizes pose at a bowling alley. Actually there were 11 Dudes, all dressed in the bathrobe-paired-with-sunglasses look made famous by actor Jeff Bridges in the movie ""The Big Lebowski."" The venue, a bowling alley outside Seattle, Washington, was the setting for the Lebowski Fest, the unofficial celebration of the Coen brothers classic. When the film -- with its story of an aging hippie bowler turned bumbling detective -- opened in 1998, ""The Big Lebowski"" fell flat at the box office and with many critics. Since then, however, the movie has developed a distinct cult following. ""These guys are not the 'Star Trek' fans, they are not the 'Star Wars' fans, they are a different class. They are not the nerds. They are the slackers,"" said attendee Scott Glancy. Dressed like a wide range of characters from the film, about 200 attendees of Seattle Lebowski Fest watched the movie yet again, bowled, drank the film's signature white Russians and quoted each other their favorite lines.  Watch highlights from the Fest » . There were plenty of Jeff ""the Dude"" Lebowskis, but also a handful of people dressed like his addled Vietnam vet sidekick Walter Sobchak, and sex offender nemesis from the bowling alley, Jesus Quintana. Others dressed up as lines of dialogue or set pieces, like the tumbleweed blowing across Los Angeles in the opening of the film. Most of the attendees stay in character the entire night with a dedication that would make Russell Crowe or Robert DeNiro jealous. ""There's a certain community thing that goes on when you hang out and watch your favorite film,"" said Lebowski Fest co-founder Scott Shuffitt. ""When you are watching it with 700 people who love it just as much as you do and everyone's quoting from it, it's just a really nice community."" Shuffitt and fellow founder Will Russell came up with the idea in 2002 while quoting lines from the movie during a slow day selling T-shirts at a tattoo expo in Louisville, Kentucky, where they live. ""People we didn't know jumped in and started quoting lines with us,"" Russell said. ""We realized we are not alone with our obsession for this movie, and we thought, 'Hey man, let's have a party in a bowling alley for ""The Big Lebowski"" ' and never thought anything would come of it, and here we are eight years later doing it all over the country."" Since then, Lebowski Fest has been held 25 times in the United States and overseas. This year, the roving celebration of the movie will visit 15 cities, including Chicago, Illinois, New York and Washington. Rachel Life, who dressed as Maude Lebowski, the film's eccentric artist and love interest for the Dude, said the fest brings a sense of community. ""I love hanging out with freaks that are like me,"" she said. ""We are letting our freak flags fly!"" Dude look-alike Kurt Michaels came for the feeling of being in on the joke. ""It's just this cult following,"" he said. ""So many people are in on something that the general public is not aware of."" And for Scott Glancy, it's about getting something -- anything -- out of an otherwise unfortunate natural resemblance to a character played by actor John Goodman. ""It's my destiny,"" he said. ""Where else can I come where I can be a superstar for four hours?""",0.68308467,5860

The best of Spielberg: ""E.T."" is our perfect family movie and perfectly captures childhood. From blockbuster to blockbuster, these are the films with something for everyone. They've got to be live action -- we've covered animated films before -- and family friendly. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Post your comments to the Screening Room blog and we'll publish the best. Read other CNN viewers' favorite and worst family films, and tell us yours >> . 1. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982) Spielberg's magic captures a perfect moment in childhood. We laughed and wept as his ugly little critter from outer space stole our hearts, while the kids fell firmly on the cute side of annoying. And oh, the music... 2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Mel Stuart, 1971) Gene Wilder's whacked-out Willy Wonka adds a pinch of sinister to Roald Dahl's anarchic sweet treat, while the ignoble exits of Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop and Mike Teevee were delicious. 3. Babe (Chris Noonan, 1995) ""That'll do, pig."" Babe is wide-eyed with wonder in Dick King-Smith's touching tale of a lonely little sheep-pig. Comic relief from the ewes, subtle special effects and a heartwarming turn from James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett make this a magical tale for all. 4. Bugsy Malone (Alan Parker, 1976) Jodie Foster and Scott Baio (Yes, Chachi from ""Happy Days!"") star in this glorious escapade set in a musical world of pint-sized gangsters and mini-molls. Al Capone for the kids; just watch out for the splurge guns... 5. Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968) Jack Wild is delightful as the Artful Dodger, Ron Moody's devilish Fagin glints with avaricious greed and Shani Willis shines as poor, ill-fated Nancy. But it's Oliver Reed's dark and sinister Bill Sykes who stayed with us -- and left us wanting more. 6. Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis, 1985) Christopher Lloyd's mad professor, a Delorean-cum-time machine, rock 'n' roll and a convenient bolt of lightning see Biff the bully get his come-uppance. All that, and a skateboarding Michael J. Fox? Mr Zemeckis, you spoil us! 7. Home Alone (Chris Columbus, 1990) Macaulay Culkin's abandoned little boy sees off bungling burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern with a series of eye-watering stunts. It proves just how great a child actor Culkin was; pity the unpopular babysitters who became the victims of copycat pranksters... 8. Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis blast ghostly green monsters to oblivion in this slime-filled romp around NYC, while taking time out to annoy Sigourney Weaver en route. Who you gonna call? 9. The Muppet Movie (James Frawley, 1979) Kermit and Co.'s roadtrip to Hollywood is a fabulously fuzzy tale of friendship and following your dreams, but the Muppet Movie's not just for kids: there's cameos a-plenty (Bob Hope, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, ORSON WELLES!) for Dad and smart one-liners by the bucketful for Mom. 10. Harry Potter (Various, 2001-present) The Hogwarts trio's wizarding adventures, backed by a cast plump with the best of British actors. Fast-paced plots, spellbinding special effects and magical sets, but be warned: it'll have the li'l critters pestering you to go to boarding school... And our favorite hide-behind-the-sofa moments... The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, 1939) ""I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!"" Margaret Hamilton's green, cackling Wicked Witch of the West is hell-bent on revenging the death of her sister and getting those ruby slippers; she'll use deadly poppies and flying monkeys to do it. Terror as a rite of passage. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (Ken Hughes, 1968) With his battered top hat and lank hair, Robert Helpmann's creepy Child Catcher prowled from Vulgaria into our nightmares, hoping to catch a whiff of his prey with his unfeasibly long nose. The only film character to give the Wicked Witch of the West a run for her money. Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977) Darth Vader may cast a formidable shadow, but it's the sound of his labored breathing that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up -- as it gets closer, closer, closer... Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Rule 475 of Surviving the Movies: Never go into the basement! The thick silence in New York's Central Library masks a phantom infestation -- and they're not going quietly. As the gray-haired librarian switched to shrieking ghoul, a generation of children was put off reading for life. Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) And again, it's the sound effects that make the Velociraptors so scary -- as the frighteningly intelligent pack of lizards hunt for Lex and Tim among the kitchen workbenches, their hissing grows ever nearer...

72,"(CNN) -- The Cannes Film Festival entrusted its opening to a Pixar film, and the animation studio did not disappoint. An adventurous boy and a cranky man travel by unusual means in the new Pixar film ""Up."" Pixar, which has produced such gems as ""Toy Story,"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""WALL-E,"" introduced its latest feature, ""Up,"" on Wednesday night at the French movie celebration. By critics' reckonings, Pixar has never released a bad film, and those who saw ""Up,"" its 10th feature, say the studio's perfect record is still intact. The film is a ""captivating odd-couple adventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along,"" wrote Variety's Todd McCarthy. ""The two leading men are 78 and 8 years old, and the age range of those who will appreciate the picture is even a bit wider than that.""  Gallery: Pixar in pictures » . ""It's a terrific family adventure,"" wrote Peter Bradshaw of Britain's The Guardian. ""The 3-D presentation gives it a real boost, but this film is airborne because of the traditional strengths: story, characterization and inventive animation with the old-fashioned values of clarity and simplicity.""  See the excitement of Cannes' opening » . ""Up"" concerns Carl Fredericksen, a balloon seller voiced by Ed Asner. Faced with eviction after his wife dies, Fredericksen decides to uproot himself -- literally -- by attaching hundreds of balloons to his house and flying it to South America. However, it turns out he's not alone. A stowaway -- a Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) -- is in the house as well, and the two of them become mutually dependent after landing a continent away. The film opens May 29 in the United States. Cannes audiences are notoriously vocal. They'll whistle if they're unhappy -- a French version of a boo -- and a movie that doesn't meet the audience's high standards will be treated to the repeated ""whop"" sounds of theater seats banging shut as patrons leave. ""Up,"" on the other hand, received little but cheers. CNN's Natasha Curry, who's at the festival, reports a morning screening concluded with applause. It's an unlikely film to be opening Cannes. Not only is it animated, it's animated by computer -- and, in some theaters, it will be shown in 3-D. Those are all firsts for a Cannes curtain raiser. But the Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan told CNN that ""Up"" fits in with Cannes' aspirations. ""Cannes likes to be seen as innovative, likes to be seen as embracing something new,"" Turan observed. ""But really the reason 'Up' is opening the festival is not because it's animated, not because it's 3-D, it's ... because it's a wonderful film. [Festival organizers] saw that, and I'm sure they liked the fact that they could do something avant-garde in terms of technique, but really it's a wonderful story, it's a terrific film and that's why it's opening."" Turan said he sees Pixar's work, and its recognition by Cannes, as another sign that animated features are among the best films being produced right now. ""The Pixar films, the Hayao Miyazaki films from Japan, the Wallace and Gromit films from Britain -- we're really living in the golden age of animation, one of the great ages of animation in the whole history of film,"" he said. ""And Cannes is happy to be part of that. Cannes is happy to recognize that."" CNN's Matthew Carey contributed to this report.",0.6791549,5885
73,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actress Patricia Clarkson has a giggle whenever she thinks about the handwritten letter she received from the great Woody Allen. Woody Allen, Patricia Clarkson, Evan Rachel Wood and Larry David worked together on ""Whatever Works."" The actress, who first worked with the famed director on the 2008 film ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" was tickled by a letter on Allen's personal stationery in which he said he had written a part for her, ""but if you have something better to do, I'll understand."" ""You know, he had me at the letter,"" Clarkson said. ""It's Woody Allen! 'If you have something better to do'? Woody, come on!"" Clarkson definitely made time to perform in Allen's latest film, ""Whatever Works."" The movie centers on a quirky, grouchy New Yorker -- played by the aptly cast Larry David -- who abandons his privileged life to become more Bohemian and hooks up with a younger woman played by Evan Rachel Wood. David, the ""Seinfeld"" co-creator known for his curmudgeonly ways and his hit HBO series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" had appeared briefly in two earlier Allen films, ""Radio Days"" and ""New York Stories."" EW ranks every single Allen film . David said he was slightly hesitant about embracing a role as large as that of Boris Yellnikoff in ""Whatever Works."" ""I read the script and I looked at the first page and there's Boris all over the first page, then I turned to page 50, and there's Boris on page 50, then I went to the last page, and there's a big monologue by this character Boris, and I thought, 'Oh, wow, this is something,' "" David said. ""So I called [Allen] up on the phone, and I said, 'I don't know if I can do this, you're making a big mistake!' ""  Watch David talk about Allen encouraging him to ""stretch"" » . David said Allen convinced him that he could pull it off. He said he enjoyed his time acting for the iconic director who, he said, was great to work with and allowed his actors freedom. ""If you're not comfortable with something, he doesn't want you to do it,"" David said. ""He doesn't mind if you change his words -- he's very easy. It was very easy to work with him."" It wasn't as easy to work with Clarkson, David said, because she is such an amazing talent. ""You forget that you're in the movie because you're just enjoying what she's doing,"" David said. ""Then all of a sudden it dawns on you, 'Oh, hey, I've got a line coming up, I better get back to this movie.' "" Clarkson, who recently garnered buzz for her appearance in the Justin Timberlake-Andy Samberg ""Motherlover"" SNL skit, plays Marietta, the mother of Yellnikoff's young paramour. She echoed David's admiration and said working with the comedian in an Allen-helmed film was incredible. ""You have a part written by Woody, you're being directed by Woody, and then you're acting with Larry David,"" she said. ""It's just genius, genius, genius, and then you have Evan Rachel Wood, who's this beautiful, amazing emerging star. I was in heaven every single day on that set."" The movie marks Wood's debut in a comedy, and like David, she found the experience a bit daunting at first. ""Not only am I doing Woody Allen dialogue, but opposite Larry,"" she said. ""Thank God he was just as nervous as I was, because he does 'Curb,' but that's mainly improv, so he never had to really memorize lines before."" Her character Melody, Wood said, isn't exactly dumb, but she is earnest. ""She is incredibly naïve and just a very sweet Southern girl who sees the good in everything and everybody and is determined to have a happy life, while Boris is determined to have a miserable one,"" she said. ""I think that's why they end up together. Opposites attract."" And even though Wood grew up in North Carolina, she said Allen encouraged her to tap even further into her roots for the role. ""Woody always told me, 'More Southern, more Southern,' "" she said. ""I was so worried about going over the top, and he really pushed me. I'm glad he did."" Although some of the characters hail from below the Mason-Dixon line, ""Whatever Works"" was shot in the mainstay setting of most of Allen's films, New York City. Clarkson, who was born in New Orleans but lives in New York, said she marvels at how the director is able to attack similar themes like love, romance and the life of New York intellectuals while still keeping his films fresh. ""And yet, I don't know how he does it,"" Clarkson said. ""And for me, this character, he takes this kind of archetypal Southern character, and he's such a Yankee, yet he figures out this beautiful way to come at this character fresh, which is almost impossible, and he did it.""",0.67896664,5393
74,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Eight years ago, Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna became global pin-ups for the resurgence in Mexican filmmaking after their memorable breakthrough in coming-of-age road movie ""Y tu Mama Tambien."" ""Rudo y Cursi"" reunites Luna and Bernal, who became pin-ups for the resurgence in Mexican filmmaking with ""Y tu Mama Tambien"" in 2001. Today, Luna and Bernal's on-screen chemistry has once again grabbed the public's attention, this time in Mexico, where their latest film ""Rudo y Cursi"" made box-office history. It became the fourth highest-grossing film in the country's history when it was released at the end of 2008. ""Rudo y Cursi,"" approximately translated as Tough and Corny, tells the story of two rural banana farmers who, after being 'spotted' by a crooked talent scout, gain instant celebrity in the Mexican soccer league playing for opposing teams. But, mesmerized by women and fast cars and unable to defy their demons, they look on powerless as the dream disintegrates in front of them almost as suddenly as it arrived. The movie touches on fame, poverty and corruption, but for its makers, it is ultimately a tale of brotherhood. It was written written and directed by Carlos Cuaron, and is the first release from groundbreaking new production venture Cha Cha Cha films. Cha Cha Cha was established by Mexico's three leading directors who are also renowned internationally -- Carlos' brother Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men""), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel"") and Guillermo del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth""). All three serve as producers on the film.  In pictures: Bernal and Garcia in ""Rudo y Cursi"" » . ""Originally I wanted to make a fake documentary about a footballer from a humble background who made it big and then disappeared mysteriously,"" Carlos Cuaron told CNN. ""But I told this idea to Gael [Garcia Bernal] and Diego [Luna], and they both said they wanted to play the part. I had one part and two actors. So I made up another brother and forgot about the fake documentary."" Cuaron also cast Bernal and Luna -- best friends since childhood in Mexico City who were so keen to do the film the signed up before they saw a script -- against type and against their wishes. Both had originally wanted to play the opposite character: Bernal the abrasive Rudo, and Luna the romantic Cursi. They were eventually dissuaded by Cuaron who said: ""I don't want to make Y Tu Mama Tambien 2."" The idea behind Cha Cha Cha films was conceived by Cuaron senior, del Toro and Innaritu when the trio -- a kind of all-stars of Mexican cinema -- found themselves with a surprise 16 nominations and 4 awards at the 2007 Oscars. The idea came out of a desire to pool their their rising bargaining power and maximize their clout in Hollywood -- and, of course, out of friendship. The company was ""born out of friendship and sibling sympathies,"" del Toro told CNN. When Carlos was originally writing the script, his bother, Alfonso told him thought it was perfect for Cha Cha Cha. The venture formalizes a working relationship del Toro, Innaritu and Alfonso Cuaron have had for years, but they freely admit they spend little time together. Rather it is a case of exchanging ideas and honing each other's writing over the phone and via email from all over the globe. Del Toro, for example, is currently in New Zealand directing Peter Jackson's follow-up to his wildly successful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Hobbit."" It would appear that the Mexican trio have created an ideal creative environment for themselves, Cha Cha Cha has been criticized for forgetting their Mexican heritage in the rush to embrace Hollywood. It is not a criticism they take lightly. Watch Cuaron, Bernal and Garcia talking about ""Rudo y Cursi"" ""I don't care about Mexican films, about indie films, about Hollywood films,"" says Alfonso. ""Just good or bad movies. ""Yes, it's great that we have a common background as Mexican creators, but once you are a creator you have a common language with creators from all around the world."" For del Toro, the company will extend the influence of Mexican cinema not diminish it: ""We want to give Mexican cinema, if you want to call it that, the credentials and right to exist in world cinema. ""People don't think twice when [Italian filmmaker] Bernardo Bertolucci is doing a movie about China called 'The Last Emperor.' ""But in your mind, Latin American filmmakers are only doing Latin American films. We're trying to show that it's important to have roots, but not borders."" The bittersweet drama has played to big laughs all over Mexico and the U.S., but for its makers, it is not simply a comedy. ""People talk about this film as if it's a comedy but I question that,"" says Alfonso. ""The elements are very dramatic and actually very tragic, and the ending has a very bittersweet tone."" According to del Toro, the movie ""says there's a way to be comfortable with failure, and finding you're emotionally more satisfied in failing."" Failure though, is not an issue overly burdening Cha Cha Cha's ""three amigos,"" -- their second film, ""Biutiful,"" set in Barcelona, directed by Inarritu and starring Javier Bardem is currently being edited in Spain. Alfonso told CNN his next movie would be shot in France and Scotland, and would be in French and English, though that too ""will be a Cha Cha Cha film."" Carlos Cuaron is the only one who is unhappy, despite the unprecedented success of his directorial debut. ""For me it's difficult,"" he says. ""Whenever I see the movie, I only see the flaws. Nobody else sees them."" ""Not even your mother?"" asks Bernal. ""No, not my mother,"" says the director. ""She thinks I'm a genius.""",0.67766833,9855
75,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Watching Iain Softley's motley, jewel-toned adaptation of ""Inkheart,"" the best-selling 2003 young-adult novel by Cornelia Funke, I had the distinct sensation of being a young bookworm again, falling into a world as vividly real as it is impossible. Brendan Fraser stars as Mo, a literature lover who brings characters to life when he reads aloud. In Funke's universe -- given voice in a screenplay by fantasy-friendly playwright David Lindsay-Abaire -- a literature lover named Mo (Brendan Fraser) possesses a dangerous talent for bringing characters from books to life when he reads aloud. The downside? When a fictional figure comes alive, a real person must disappear into the book's pages. That explains the extended absence of Mo's wife, Resa (Sienna Guillory). Mo has not yet told the truth about Resa's disappearance to their intrepid young daughter, Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett), just as many a movie adult before him annoyingly withheld information from their children for dramatic effect. (Maybe Fraser's Mo, a pleasantly square-framed American among a population of Brits, just can't bring himself to utter the word ''Mummy.'') It also explains the presence of a rambunctious crowd of fictional interlopers. These include a soulful fire juggler (Paul Bettany) who yearns for home (and why not, when real-life wife Jennifer Connelly appears briefly as the juggler's fairy-tale missus), and an acquisitive villain named Capricorn (Andy Serkis, always welcome even without his Gollum suit). A unicorn and ""The Wizard of Oz's"" flying monkeys also make appearances -- as does, briefly, Toto too. The story is a whirl, a jumble, an effusion -- sometimes flowing smoothly, other times jerking along as if the filmmaker (""Backbeat,"" ""The Wings of the Dove"") has been given advice he resents regarding pacing and the balance of sweetness and danger. There are close calls, weird whispers, amusing throwaway lines, the ditherings of a distractible author (Jim Broadbent), and cartoon violence undertaken by misshapen scary-comic evil henchmen. But most deliciously madcap of all, there are the grand gestures and imperious pronouncements of Helen Mirren as Meggie's flesh-and-blood great-aunt Elinor, a creature of pencil-thin eyebrows and luscious costumery who caws and squawks with very unqueenly abandon. Mirren's all-out display in this distinctly British absurdo-literary extravaganza had me wishing Elinor were my own fabulous auntie and that she'd lend me some magic items from her closet.

""I learned a great deal about film and the process,"" the Academy Award winning actor added. ""I spent six weeks without another actor on the set, just Roman and I and a crew -- and that's, that's a dream come true for an actor. I cherished those memories."" ""He is sweet and very strong and is very, very demanding, in the tradition of an auteur,"" said Sigourney Weaver about being directed by Polanski in 1994's ""Death and the Maiden."" It's a reputation Polanski's earned and maintained, despite his 1977 guilty plea on a statutory rape charge of unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl.  Watch the mixed reaction in Switzerland to Polanski's arrest » . The celebrated director fled the United States and settled in France to escape jail, but by the standards of those in Hollywood, the case is ancient history. ""We hope today that this latest order will be dropped,"" Winger said. ""It is based on a three decade old case that is all but dead, except for a minor technicality."" Matthew Belloni, who has has been following the Polanski case for The Hollywood Reporter's  legal blog, said the outpouring of support from the film industry is not surprising. ""It is a criminal conviction of a terrible crime, but it is something that the industry is willing to look the other way on,"" Belloni said. ""If Hollywood really gets to look at itself and judge the personal character of a lot of the artists in the community, there would be a lot of empty seats at the Oscars because a lot of people have personal problems. This sort of is at the extreme level of that."" As Polanski's star rose after his Oscar-winning hit, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" the world got to know the director's back story. He was the son of Polish Jews whose mother died in a concentration camp even as a young Polanski escaped the Nazis. Polanski grew up to become a famous director and married  actress Sharon Tate. He later became the object of national sympathy when Tate was murdered by the Charles Manson Family in 1969. His next big movie, 1974's ""Chinatown,"" was nominated for 11 Oscars. That success gave Hollywood its heroic tag line for Polanski: Tragic survivor moves on. Actors from his films said they have felt a certain empathy as they are directed by him. ""Roman was one of those poor Krakow ghetto children who had to hide in the latrine,"" said Sir Ben Kingsley, who starred with Weaver in ""Death and the Maiden."" Brody hailed Polanski for his survival, even in the face of being separated from his parents and losing his mother at Auschwitz. ""He survived alone, basically, in hiding,"" Brody said. ""It's one of the many things I feel he's overcome, and what's wonderful about Roman is that although he's experienced some tragic things in his life, he also has this unbroken spirit."" After the rape case, American authorities sought his arrest, but he continued to work around the world on movies such as ""Tess"" and ""The Ninth Gate,"" traveling to film festivals and movie sets. But it was in 2002 when Polanski rocketed back onto the public stage, with ""The Pianist."" The Holocaust film won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, igniting a buzz culminating in three Oscars in 2003, including best actor for Brody and best director for Polanski. Harrison Ford accepted the award in his absence. The crowd at the Kodak Theater roared. The Hollywood Reporter's Belloni explained Hollywood's readiness to forgive. ""Look at some of the people who have been involved with scandals,"" Belloni said. "" ""Everyone from Michael Vick, who is now playing football again, to Mel Gibson, who has been involved in a lot of scandals, now he's working again. America is a very, very forgiving culture, and Hollywood itself. If you are a talent, the industry is willing in many ways to look the other way."" And the industry isn't alone in wanting to put the past aside. Polanski's victim, Samantha Geimer, told CNN's Larry King in 2003 that she wished the story and the case had ended soon after it began three decades ago. ""The publicity was so traumatic and so horrible his punishment was secondary to just getting this whole thing to stop,"" Geimer said. ""It was crazy. I never wanted him to go to jail.""",0.677229,9038
77,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Given a cast of Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill, and the guiding hand of director and writer Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""), perhaps there is no more appropriate title than simply ""Funny People."" Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow get together at the ""Funny People"" premiere in Hollywood. Which is saying something, since ""Funny People"" frequently treads into the darker realms of comedy. Sandler leads the cast as George Simmons, an A-list Hollywood comedian whose fame and fortune has brought him a beautiful mansion on the beach, lots of luck with the ladies and, as the audience soon discovers, a life of loneliness. Sandler is quick to point out that he and his character have little in common. ""I can't really say this guy is me; he's not living my life,"" says Sandler, who is married with two children. ""The movie star thing we have in common; we have a few mood swings in common. ... But the lifestyle and the attitude is not really me."" George's biggest problem isn't his desolation, however. He's been diagnosed with a leukemia-like terminal disease, prompting him to get back to his roots and do more stand-up comedy. Along the way, he hires struggling comedian Ira Wright, played by Rogen, to pen jokes for him and act as his personal assistant. Despite hurling an occasional insult at Ira, George learns to trust his new, eager-to-please sidekick. The feeling isn't always mutual. Ira is forced to adapt to his boss' constant mood swings, erratic behavior as he deals with the fear of dying and deep regret at losing Laura (Leslie Mann), the only woman he ever loved. However, Ira does earn a steady paycheck -- and gets a taste of show business. Rogen, who says he wouldn't be in comedy if he never saw Sandler's movies while he was growing up, says ""Funny People"" paints an accurate picture of the ups and downs of comedians who are just starting out. ""It's an incredibly realistic representation,"" Rogen says. ""Those scenes where you're backstage at the comedy club and you're all sitting around pitching jokes to each other. It's exactly like that."" Apatow, who performed stand-up comedy earlier in his career, says, ""It is an ode to stand-up. I've always been a crazy fan of stand-up comedians. Jonathan Winters ... Don Rickles, things like that."" Apatow, who knows he's taking a risk with ""Funny People's"" mix of light and darkness, made a wisecrack about his hopes for the film at the Los Angeles premiere. ""Well, I think there's 10 movies that are going to be up for best picture this year, and we definitely are shooting for No. 16,"" he says. The cast also took some risks, performing stand-up in front of live audiences for the film -- and, occasionally, watching their jokes fall flat. Hill says he had never done stand-up before and calls the experience ""terrifying."" ""It can be brutal out there,"" Rogen adds. Sandler, the most seasoned comedian by far, remembers his first days onstage and can relate. ""It's all about your last set,"" he recalls. ""If I did good Wednesday ... all day Thursday, I was in a good mood. ""Then Thursday night comes around and I go onstage and if I did bad, Friday was a miserable time for everyone.""",0.67607033,5510
78,"(CNN) -- Watch out! Lock up your loved ones! Another bloated, over-produced, high-concept monstrosity has escaped from the labs at Dreamworks Animation, and it's out to devour your kids. Susan, aka ""Ginormica,"" has to save the world in ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" But don't be too alarmed. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is relatively harmless -- a toothless satire with a knee-jerk feminist theme and a sorry excuse for a plot. That sounds harsh, I know. Who doesn't want to see a 50-foot woman careening through San Francisco on skates that turn out to be automobiles -- the ultimate demolition roller derby? But think about that, just for a second. Roller skates work because they have fixed wheels. Try it with motorcars and you won't get very far. Is that too picky? Perhaps, but you wouldn't find Pixar playing so fast and loose with the laws of physics, and that kind of inattention to detail is typical of the lackadaisical storytelling here and in other Dreamworks animated features. (The talent pool for this one includes the directors of ""Shrek 2"" and ""Shark Tale"" and the writers of ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""The Rocker,"" incidentally.) High concepts, top-notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script. The XXXL lady in question -- dubbed ""Ginormica"" by her U.S. military guards -- starts out plain and petite Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), until a meteorite hits her just minutes before she's supposed to tie the knot with unctuous chauvinist Derek (Paul Rudd). Her rapid growth spurt saves her from that particular fate worse than death, even if at first glance her new roommates don't look like much of an improvement. There's Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a mad scientist who semi-advertently mutated with a bug; B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) an amorphous blue jelly-like blob who gets on just fine without a brain; Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gung-ho amphibian who's all mouth; and a giant dust mite called Insectosaurus who isn't voiced by anyone because he doesn't have anything to say. Sci-fi fans will have fun counting off the references to myriad classics -- ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Invaders from Mars,"" ""The Fly,"" ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" ""The Blob,"" ""Mothra"" and ""Attack of the 50-Foot Woman,"" for starters -- and noting a few clever bits and pieces (Kiefer Sutherland, as General W.R. Monger, riffs on George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove""). The trouble is, once the introductions are over, the filmmakers can only launch their desperately limp plot: The White House turns to these monstrous superheroes to save the planet from evil Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson), a squidlike creature with four eyes and twice as many legs, and a one-eyed tin robot to do his dirty work for him. Ginormica gets a kick-butt finale, and is a much stronger character -- in any number of ways -- than the movie's president. (In a genuinely witty casting touch he's voiced by Stephen Colbert.) That may be good politics or at least a sound marketing decision from the studio's perspective -- it's been awhile since a family animated feature produced a genuinely strong female character (unless you count ""Coraline,"" which was way too scary for my family) -- but Susan's self-esteem is an awfully long time coming. iReport.com: What do you think of 'Monsters vs. Aliens'? (Bizarrely -- and maybe it's just my imagination -- Gallaxhar bears a passing resemblance to President Obama. I wonder ... would that make Susan/Ginormica a surrogate for Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton?) Visually, too, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" is undistinguished, although its shortcomings may be disguised if you seek out the 3-D version. Funny how 3-D movies tend to produce two-dimensional characters, with ""Coraline"" again the exception to the rule. Jocular and unpretentiously trashy, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" should be a lot of fun -- and it is, in places. But the truth is it's as hung up on itself as Susan's preening fiance. Hand on heart, I had a better time at ""Space Chimps."" ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" runs 94 minutes and is rated PG. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.",0.67388934,2217
81,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- England doesn't yet swing in the transporting, ruefully tender coming-of-age drama ""An Education."" Carey Mulligan and Peter Sarsgaard star as a couple in ""An Education."" It's 1961, and Jenny (Carey Mulligan), a bright 16-year-old schoolgirl in a tidy London suburb, nurtures aspirations of sophistication that involve smoking cigarettes and dreaming of the day she can sit in a Paris cafe. Beatles-era grooviness and sexual liberation haven't yet reached this corner of the Empire, where cautious, 1950s-style postwar provincialism still prevails -- the same squareness the gents across the pond in ""Mad Men"" are just beginning to bend. Jenny's dad (Alfred Molina) is fearful and fussy; Mum (Cara Seymour) is resigned. So the good student studies her Latin, grinding for admisson into Oxford University. Life lessons don't begin until she meets David (Peter Sarsgaard), who's in his early 30s, and Jewish, and suave. He's so charmant, he even dazzles Mum and Dad. Being included in David's exotic, if mysteriously shady, universe -- the travel, the jazz clubs that hint at wider horizons, and, oh yes, the sex -- is like a crash course in worldliness. And as this picture of times that were a-changin' demonstrates with quiet, though conventionally built, artistry, worldliness has its discontents. ""An Education"" is the vivid story of how one girl became a woman -- and how Olde England morphed into the youthquake center of '60s yeah yeah yeah. None of which would be quite so vivid without the beguiling performance of newcomer Mulligan. She's very much an It Girl, with her natural elegance in a brunet upsweep à la Audrey Hepburn. And she's protectively partnered by Sarsgaard in the tricky job of playing sweet yet suspect, a balance he sustains with nonchalance. Equally important players: Dominic Cooper and the divine Rosamund Pike as David's ever-so-knowing pals, Olivia Williams as a teacher who hates to see her prize pupil make poor choices, and Emma Thompson, steaming forth like a battleship as Jenny's headmistress. The movie, in a palette of cloudy blues, is adapted from a vivid memoir by British journalist Lynn Barber and directed by gifted Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig from a screenplay of economical empathy by ""High Fidelity"" novelist Nick Hornby. Afterward, you'll want to listen to the Beatles sing ""She's Leaving Home."" It might be a girl like Jenny the lads had in mind. EW Grade: A-minus .

82,"(CNN) -- Ricky Gervais says he's not sure if the lead in ""Ghost Town"" -- an anti-social, cynical dentist named Bertram Pincus -- was written for him. Ricky Gervais has established a career playing characters with an abrasive edge. And he's not sure if he wants to know. ""I'm scared to ask,"" he says in a phone interview from Los Angeles, California. ""[Writer-director David Koepp] says that when they first had the idea, that it should be played by me, [and] they never looked back. Now I don't know whether that was as they were coming up with it, or whether it was because they found out no one else was available. Steve Carell had said no, Will Ferrell had said no, Jack Black had said no, Ben Stiller had said no ... everyone had said no, and they went, 'Oh, is there no one ... I wonder if HE'S available.' ""I don't know which is closer. I'd like to think the first one's closer."" But, he adds, he was more than happy to take the role. ""When I read it, I thought, 'This is me,' "" he says. ""It was my voice; it's something I could have written. Even the lines sounded like that grumpy misanthrope I often play. And then they made it even more me.""  Watch a clip from ""Ghost Town"" with Mr. Moviefone » . Indeed, Gervais, 47, has risen to fame playing characters who are, let us say, less than friendly. On the original UK version of ""The Office,"" which he created with longtime writing partner Stephen Merchant, he played David Brent, the socially tone-deaf general manager of a paper company branch office who continually shocked co-workers with his immature jokes and patronizing attitude. He followed that as Andy Millman in ""Extras,"" a borderline performer always angling for the main chance. And in ""Ghost Town,"" which came out on DVD Sunday, Gervais' Dr. Pincus can't stand to communicate with the ghosts he starts meeting after a near-death experience. He does have a bit of redemption.  He strikes up a romance with Gwen (Tea Leoni), an antiquities expert, and ends up helping out a few of his late comrades. But in Gervais' portrayal, Pincus retains his abrasive edge. The movie earned generally good reviews and a decent box office upon its late-summer release, with the Boston Globe's Ty Burr comparing Gervais to a Hollywood legend. ""Someone once said about W.C. Fields that he had the rare ability to despise amusingly. I can imagine no greater compliment than to say that Ricky Gervais seems, at his best, like a young Fields,"" Burr wrote. That kind of misanthrope is the furthest thing from the Gervais of the phone interview, an engaging man who answers questions with patience and thoughtfulness. Asked why British actors play socially unpleasant roles so well, he ponders the question, makes asides to how often British actors play villains and ""bumbling fops"" and soon offers a disquisition on the differences between British and American culture.  Watch more insight on interviewing Ricky Gervais » . ""I think we play the loser well because England's full of them,"" he says. ""We celebrate our losers, we celebrate our underdogs, we celebrate those people -- [and then] we build them up and then we don't like them anymore. Whereas Americans celebrate success. Americans are brought up to believe they can be the next president of the United States. British people are told it won't happen to you. It sounds like a generalization, but it's true."" He adds that he just finished writing a film with Merchant called ""The Man from the Pru,"" set in early-'70s England. ""It's about class, and it's about can you escape being born living, growing up and dying in the same street,"" he says. ""I know that's the same the world over ... but it's because Britain is so small and so diverse. ""You really couldn't get out of your class before celebrity came along. The American class system always seemed a bit fairer to me, because it was built on achievement as opposed to blood."" Since Gervais likes to write his own material, he's careful about the roles he takes, even with Hollywood beckoning. ""Ghost Town"" was a good fit, he says, because he and Koepp hit it off so well. ""The whole thing was really collaborative,"" he says. ""I'm not usually an actor for hire, but this was great."" Indeed, it's the collaboration that made it, he says. He welcomes that kind of bouncing ideas back and forth, and says he'd love to do something with Steve Carell, who plays the American version of Brent, Michael Scott, on the U.S. version of ""Office."" The two had a memorably hilarious exchange at this year's often unfunny Emmy show. ""I would love to host anything with Steve Carell,"" he says. ""I would do a cat show with Steve Carell. I would do Computer Nerds' Mr. Universe with Steve Carell. So if anyone asks me if I will host a show with Steve Carell, the answer's yes."" Perhaps that could happen soon: Gervais' name is often bandied about in rumors about awards show hosting duties. However, he adds, he remains in the dark about it all. ""I'm on a list,"" he says. ""But I don't know what that means.""",0.67327553,2637
83,"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- If you stared at empty seats around your Thanksgiving dinner table, Robert DeNiro's newest film could help. Parents who want their kids home for Christmas may do well by persuading them to see ""Everybody's Fine,"" which opens next Friday in U.S. theaters. ""I'm hoping it might catch the moment, and it might catch the Christmas spirit and the Thanksgiving spirit,"" director-writer Kirk Jones told CNN over coffee in Hollywood. The movie is targeted at people with parents, brothers, sisters or children, Jones said. ""Pretty much everyone,"" Jones said. ""It's about family."" The story centers around a cross-country journey by DeNiro's character struggling to bring together his grown children for Christmas, several months after their mother's death. DeNiro reveals a sensitive, aging father who imagines that ""everybody's fine"" -- a solace for his lonely suffering. Each stop reveals how his wife had sheltered him from bad news about his kids -- played by Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell -- and how they did not know how to communicate honestly with him. His children were not living the lives he had fantasized for them. ""It's easier not to face up to the truth,"" Jones said. Audiences emerged from preview screenings thinking about their own parents or children, Jones said. ""People are coming out of the movie, almost without exception, saying 'I've got to ring my mom, I've got to ring my dad,'"" Jones said. The strongest reactions have come from people between 24 and 35, many of whom told Jones he's ""scratched a nerve,"" he said. ""They were saying 'That's me. That's my dad. Those are my parents.'"" ""Most people have got regrets,"" he said. ""When they leave their parents, everyone looks back and thinks, 'I should have invited them on holiday with us that time or I should have made it that weekend or I should have just called them more often.'"" It's a remake of Giuseppe Tornatore's 1990 Italian film ""Stanno Tutti Bene"" -- English translation: Everybody's Fine. But Jones, a British director best known as the writer-director of the 1998 surprise hit ""Waking Ned Devine,"" made this into an American story. Jones took his own trip for inspiration before writing the screenplay, traveling by train and bus across the United States. He realized the telephone wires he saw, stretching from pole to pole for hundreds of miles along the tracks and highways, serve as a metaphor for his story. ""It's like a wave, a musical rhythm,"" Jones said. Frank -- DeNiro's character -- spent his life manufacturing the protective coating for the telephone lines. ""He protected the line of communication,"" Jones said. But decades of exposure to the chemicals made him ill, as did his years of insulation from honest communications with his family. ""The irony is, when he's traveling, the children are talking about him through his wires,"" Jones said. A personal irony for the director is that, for the 14 months Jones was making this movie about family togetherness in the United States, he was away from his own family in England.",0.66983724,8217
84,"(CNN) -- Remember ""You're money, baby""? Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau making the L.A. bar scene in ""Swingers"" back in 1996? In the film, couples go to the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal on relationship counseling. They were young and hungry then, and there was insolence in their hustle, but at least they pressed their case: They knew they were sharp enough to be players. Since then, Favreau has gone on to direct blockbusters like ""Elf"" and ""Iron Man,"" and his buddy Vaughn has stacked up a string of hits in the company of Frat Packers Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Well, they're not hungry anymore, and not so young either. Between them (and with an assist from Dana ""What Happens in Vegas"" Fox), they have cooked up ""Couples Retreat,"" a marriage comedy that coincidentally doubles as an enviable excuse for an extended shoot in Bora Bora.  Watch the stars talk about the shoot » . That's the tropical location of the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal for married couples looking for relationship counseling. Jason and Cynthia (Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) want to give it a shot, and persuade their supposedly happily married friends Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Malin Akerman), Joey and Lucy (Favreau and Kristin Davis), and Shane and his 20-year-old girlfriend Trudy (Faizon Love and Kali Hawk) to join in the fun. Apparently, nobody has trouble raising the fare, even in these recessionary times. Once there, however, they are dismayed to find Eden is run with iron discipline, and the mandatory therapy sessions soon expose serious cracks in each of the relationships. Directed by Peter ""A Christmas Story"" Billingsley -- another old friend of Vaughn's -- ""Couples Retreat"" can't decide if it's satirizing New Age-y therapies or exploring marital breakdown. So it gives us a little of both, with some sub-Apatow sex humor on the side. As a commercial recipe, that's fine. America's ticket buyers have shown time and again they're desperate for a laugh and willing to overlook widespread mediocrity to get it. But you might hope for something a bit less lazy from this team. And shouldn't a movie with ""Couples"" in the title be less lopsided in its approach to the sexes? I guess in contrast to such boys-will-be-boys romps as ""The Hangover"" and ""Wild Hogs,"" at least this time the wives get to come along, not that any of them has much to say for herself. Trudy wants to party. Lucy has eyes for the yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce). Ronnie wants some romance. And Cynthia ... I don't know what Cynthia wants, but getting away from her control freak husband certainly seems like the way to go. The guys are noticeably chubbier, but equally one-dimensional. It's just that that dimension enjoys rather more screen time as Billingsley indulges Vaughn and Favreau's less-than-inspired improvisational riffs on marital frustration, machismo and middle-age spread. We even have to endure a Guitar Hero duel. For a movie made by a bunch of friends, it's strange that we don't get any sense of how or why these couples hang out together. But so long as there's a pretentious Frenchman to scoff at, an officious Brit and a sexy Hispanic, at least they're united by what they're not. Whether by accident or design, ""Couples Retreat"" does such a good job exposing what selfish, insensitive jerks these guys are, the contrived and conventional ending actually has a feel-bad undertow. You've got to suspect that back home in suburbia, these couples are doomed to live unhappily ever after. ""Couples Retreat"" is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.",0.66967446,8912

87,"(CNN) -- There's never a bad time for a toga party, right? The story of Perseus -- the bastard son of Zeus who takes on the mighty Kraken -- will endure long after Louis Leterrier's enjoyably cheesy movie has been forgotten (or, inevitably, remade in 4D). But for now, and for young men especially, Leterrier's version is the one that counts, and it will just have to do. It's a mixed bag: Three credited screenwriters have labored in the footsteps laid down by the 1981 Ray Harryhausen ""classic"" (hardly his finest hour) -- that is, they've taken the myth as an excuse to showcase as many special effects sequences as they can muster. That's not a bad strategy when it's clear from the laughably clumsy opening that they haven't a clue how the ancient Greeks spoke to one another. The clunky dialogue is delivered in various shades of tone deaf Antipodean, English, Irish and European by the likes of Sam Worthington (Perseus), Gemma Arterton (as his spiritual guru/love interest) and Liam Neeson (Zeus). Neeson's old ""Schindler"" nemesis Ralph Fiennes brings a touch of class to Zeus's brother Hades, while the great, growly, scene-stealing Mads Mikkelsen (Le Chiffre in ""Casino Royale"") makes the strongest impression among the mortals. Mikkelsen's only serious competition in the scenery-chewing stakes comes from the Kraken itself, a toothy sea monster who is built up for an hour and three quarters, then comes on for five minutes -- wisely doesn't say a word -- and walks away with the picture. In Harryhausen's day, effects meant stop-motion photography of artfully modeled monsters, including a three-headed dog (excised here) and a golden mechanical owl (who makes a cameo appearance for old time's sake). Today's CGI creatures may not have the same charm, but they're considerably more agile and fluid, and the action scenes have tremendous dynamism. Leterrier comes from ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""The Transporter,"" and he's evidently more comfortable running than walking. A showdown with gigantic angry scorpions is the movie's first big set-piece, and it's exciting enough to make you forget you've seen these critters before -- or something very similar, in ""Transformers."" The three Graeae are ghastly, touchy-feely crones with one eye between them, and Medusa is a giant snake who slithers around her lair like a heat-seeking missile - though I preferred the aplomb Uma Thurman brought to the role in ""The Lightning Thief."" Like his namesake Percy Jackson, Perseus has daddy issues -- he's a demi-god who wants to prove he's all man. After ""Avatar"" and ""Terminator Salvation"" Worthington has cast-iron credentials on that score. We can see why Perseus would resist invitations to join the Immortals. Mount Olympus looks like a colossal bore, a resting home for eternity. You wonder what they find to talk about all day. At least on Earth there are monsters to mash and quests to be quested. iReport: Critic says ""Avoid at any cost"" If it's bad enough to be good in places, there's no excuse for the film's abominable retro-fitted 3D, a process that perversely flattens out the images into two planes, foreground and background, and renders this one of the ugliest epics in history. It's a shame to see filmmakers jumping on a bandwagon like this, and missing. You'd be well advised to seek out the picture's 2D venues -- or wait for the DVD.",0.66683924,9641
88,"(CNN) -- Happy birthday, Catherine Zeta-Jones. You are turning 40 this month, joining an exclusive club of women in show business who are marking the same milestone this year. Catherine Zeta-Jones arrives at a Hollywood event earlier this year. She turns 40 on September 25. Think big names like Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Aniston, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez and Cate Blanchett. It's a birthday many actors -- but especially female stars -- in Hollywood would once dread, hide and agonize over. At an age where men could comfortably play heroes and lovers in the prime of their life -- and could do so for many years to come -- women often found themselves starting to be cast in different roles. (One example: ""The Graduate,"" where 36-year-old Anne Bancroft played a frustrated ""older woman"" trying to seduce Dustin Hoffman, who was just six years younger than she at the time.) No wonder some stayed mum about their age, but this generation of 40-something female entertainers is different. They're holding birthday bashes, embracing the big four-oh and staying as busy and famous as ever. Their faces grace magazine covers, their bodies are the envy of women decades younger and their careers seem to be going strong.  See photos of stars who are 40 and still hot » . Zellweger herself has said she hasn't noticed good parts getting scarce. ""I don't see it. I don't know. I'm so spoiled with respect to the experiences I've had and the opportunities I've had that I don't see it,"" she said, according to published news reports. So has anything changed for women hitting 40 in a business obsessed with youth? Industry observers say stars like Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Aniston have more options than ever to have long, distinguished careers thanks to independent films and television, but opinions are mixed on whether they can sustain a big Hollywood presence. ""These women are still among the most bankable, biggest stars in the industry and turning 40 isn't going to change that,"" said Kathy Heintzelman, entertainment director for More, a magazine geared toward women over 40.  Watch a report on the most rich and famous women over 40 » . Importance of box office . But others argue that the opportunity to land lead roles in major studio films for actresses like Aniston, Zeta-Jones and Zellweger is running out. It's all about the global box office for Hollywood, which right now is most interested in making comic book movies or big-action, special-effect films in which women are mostly decorative, said Leah Rozen, film critic for People magazine. That often leaves few lead roles in big-budget Hollywood films for established female stars as they get older. ""They're going to work, but the entire movie will not be built around them. It will not be a Renee Zellweger vehicle or a Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle, unless it's an indie film,"" Rozen said. ""I'm not saying anything about the quality of the movies they're making or their validity as actresses,"" Rozen said. ""I am saying that viewed as box office -- or can they open a movie? -- the answer would be no right now."" Zellweger's most recent project, ""My One and Only,"" which Rozen called a ""very sweet little film,"" has grossed less than $1 million since it premiered last month (it opened in wide release last Friday.) Earlier this year, her film ""New in Town"" grossed about $16 million domestically, according to Boxofficemojo.com. Zeta-Jones' last big Hollywood role was in the 2007 movie ""No Reservations,"" which earned $43 million in the United States. Aniston has had a better run. Last year's ""Marley & Me"" took in $143 million domestically and more recently, ""He's Just Not That Into You"" earned $93 million. Men are viable as box office leads far longer than most women, Rozen said. Think Harrison Ford, who was still the action hero at 66 in last year's ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (which earned $317 million domestically) or Sean Connery, who at 69 was paired with a then-30-year-old Zeta-Jones in 1999's ""Entrapment"" ($87 million domestic gross). A big exception to this trend has been Meryl Streep.  Watch a report on women over 40 who make us laugh » . Streep, 60, has a great track record at the movies with films including the recent ""Julie & Julia"" and last year's ""Mamma Mia!"" She's part of a very successful run of female-centric movies that have starred women over 40, said Jane Fleming, president of the nonprofit organization Women In Film. ""That proves if you have an audience base that wants to see you, they're going to keep coming out to see you regardless your age,"" Fleming said. ""What's been nice about the last two years is that there's been economic proof that that audience exists and that given the right form of entertainment, it will be very lucrative for the studios.""

But she was also glad to note that there are more opportunities in general for female stars over 40. ""I don't know why it's changed, but I'm really grateful it has.

89,"(CNN) -- For actress Kyra Sedgwick, it's the public's approval that makes it worth being away from her family for six months to tape her critically acclaimed series ""The Closer."" Kyra Sedgwick and her husband, Kevin Bacon, at the 66th annual Golden Globe Awards this month. But she may be getting more approval from her peers, too. Sedgwick will walk the red carpet again Sunday night at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where she is nominated for a fourth consecutive year for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for her role as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. She's also won a Golden Globe for her performance, in 2007. The TNT series resumes Monday night where it left off in September with what Sedgwick called ""a fantastic five episodes."" (TNT is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) ""I said to the writers, 'I really want a lot of personal stuff for Brenda,' "" Sedgwick said. ""I feel like there's some of those personal quiet moments with her alone, is something that I've been missing as an actor, and I feel like the audience has been missing, too. ""She is such a complicated, fascinating character, and watching her growth and lack of growth is something that is really interesting,"" she said. When CNN asked whether the new episodes might include a wedding for her character, Sedgwick laughed. ""That might very well happen,"" she said. ""That's pretty insightful of you. I'm just going to just say that."" A marriage for Brenda Johnson would be ""a complicated, difficult situation,"" she said, because ""she's basically married to her work."" Sedgwick's job also complicates her real-life marriage to Bacon, since the show is produced in Los Angeles and the couple lives in Connecticut with their two children. That's where the approval -- whether on the street from fans or at award shows -- has ""been a wonderful phenomenon for me,"" she said. ""On a personal level, that's really good for me, because I really miss my family when I'm working on the show six months in L.A.,"" she said. ""As much as I try to get my kids to move to L.A. and my husband, they just wouldn't have it. ""It's challenging, and I'm glad that people are watching, because otherwise it would be kind of hard to go to work,"" Sedgwick said. Sedgwick has moved into an executive producer's role on the show, which she said she expects to continue for at least two more years. ""I love being with a group where there's not a power struggle,"" she said. ""I have a lot of say, and I always have. And that feels really good.""

92,"(CNN) -- The music of Woodstock was a draw that attracted hundreds of thousands of people to the festival. Similarly, the name of Ang Lee is a draw that attracted a number of actors to his new film, ""Taking Woodstock."" From left, ""Taking Woodstock's"" Emile Hirsch, director Ang Lee and Demetri Martin at the movie's premiere. ""Taking Woodstock,"" which is out August 28, features performers who were either not born or very young when the monumental festival occurred in 1969, but many were enticed to join the movie because of Lee's involvement. ""I'd read the Sunday paper for Ang Lee. I'd do anything. He's a filmmaker I've always admired and [was] sort of eager to work with,"" said Liev Schreiber, who plays a transvestite. ""So when he approached me, you know: Dress, shmess, I'll do whatever you want."" Lee's work, which includes the renowned films ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" has garnered him three Oscar nominations. The lighthearted ""Taking Woodstock"" is a mild departure for a man whose films tend toward serious drama. The film's plot concerns Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin), son of the owners of a fading Catskills hotel, who helped attract the Woodstock festival to the area. It's based on Tiber's memoir. The film also stars Emile Hirsch, Jonathan Groff and Eugene Levy. The 36-year-old Martin, who is best known for his standup, his contributions to ""The Daily Show"" and hosting ""Important Things with Demetri Martin,"" might have benefited the most from working with Lee. ""Taking Woodstock"" is his first film as star, and he's made only a handful of others. ""Ang is not really going to hold your hand and reassure you through the whole thing. He's going to be more like a sensei, kind of a tough-love thing,"" Martin said. ""He's like, 'Punch this wall,' and you'll be like, 'Why?' and he's like, 'Punch the wall, and do it.' ""And then it's like, 'Oh, good performance, great. I'm glad I punched the wall,' and you don't understand, but it's really a lesson in trust,"" he added. Jonathan Groff also came to ""Taking Woodstock"" with limited big-screen experience and was excited to work with Lee. ""He's your fearless leader. He's everything that you want to be when you grow up,"" Groff said. Woodstock may have been 40 years ago, but it's recent enough that a number of the principals are still alive. Groff had the opportunity to meet Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang, whom he plays in the movie. Lang opened his memories to Groff and also visited the set. ""He came to the first day on set, and that was a little nerve-wracking, but it then became comforting because as we would be between takes he would, you know, be giving you a little thumbs-up,"" Groff recalled. ""I'm sure it must have been a little out-of-body. I mean, I can't imagine watching someone playing me in a movie, from 40 years earlier."" The 24-year-old Groff thinks Woodstock resonates today. ""Coming from my generation and looking back and seeing such innocence and seeing such passion and seeing such faith in each other, and the ability to come together and actually make something huge happen, is really inspiring,"" he said. Although there haven't been similar watershed events since, Schreiber and Groff said that the most similar event could be the 2008 election campaign, during which many young people rallied behind Barack Obama. ""Well, I gotta say that there is an air of optimism and potential in the election of Barack Obama,"" Schreiber said. ""I certainly feel a return to that sense of optimism and patriotism that I think people felt at perhaps the election of Kennedy and the beginning of the civil right's movement in America and the sexual revolution. ... It did feel somewhat timely."" The movie also tested Hirsch's and Schreiber personal boundaries: In addition to Schreiber's dress, Hirsch was naked for one scene. ""It wasn't just photographed. I was filmed!"" Hirsch said. ""What was fun about it is it was kind of like this liberating [situation], but that's what Woodstock was."" As for Schreiber, when his children saw him in a dress, they were ""terrified,"" and his partner, actress Naomi Watts, was ""pretty mortified."" ""I think that was sort of the point. I think the message is one of acceptance,"" Schreiber said. Scaring the kids is one thing, but what about wearing the dress on the set in front of the cast and crew? ""It was exhilaratingly humiliating,"" Schreiber said. ""I think that's generally how men feel when they put on dresses. That's why they do it so often.""

93,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- ""Amelia"" is a frustratingly old-school, Hollywood-style, inspirational biopic about Amelia Earhart that doesn't trust a viewer's independent assessment of the famous woman pictured on the screen. Hilary Swank plays Amelia Earhart and Richard Gere plays husband George Putnam in ""Amelia."" The mystery we ought to be paying attention to is: What really happened on the legendary American aviator's final, fatal flight in 1937? But the question audiences are left with is this: How could so tradition-busting a role model have resulted in so square, stiff, and earthbound a movie? Why present such a modern woman in such a fusty format? Dressed for the title role in a wardrobe of jumpsuits, leather jackets, scarves, and slinky evening wear dashing enough to stop air traffic, Hilary Swank's Earhart doesn't so much talk as make stump speeches -- even when she's at her own breakfast table. And director Mira Nair (""The Namesake""), working from an overexplanatory script by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan (based on dual biographies by Susan Butler and Mary S. Lovell), overloads the picture with a cargo of messages, so much so that she deadens her subject's spirit. Some of these talking points are aimed at today's teenage girls who might admire the subject's highly personal fashion sense; others go out to older women who cherish her feminist cred. All of them add up to banners that might as well be flown from an aircraft tail over a beach: Amelia Earhart lived free in life and love! And Fly! She! Must! Of course, she did, setting records as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic in 1928 (she was a passenger, but still, ladies of the day generally didn't wear leather helmets and zoom through the air). Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932. She went on to launch her own brand-name fashion line. In 1935, she became the first pilot to fly solo from Hawaii to California. Sometimes the press dubbed her Lady Lindy, linking her fame to that of pioneering pilot Charles Lindbergh. Most famously, she vanished (along with her navigator, Fred Noonan) in the middle of the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1937; her plane was never found, and she was declared legally dead in 1939. Along the way, the celebrity married George Putnam, the publisher and tireless promoter who shaped her public image. (Richard Gere does the honors as Putnam with all the dated, silver-head-in-hands poses required of him as a worried businessman/spouse whose wife is also his client.) For a time, the freethinking woman also conducted a love affair with aeronautics pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor), now best known as the father of writer Gore Vidal. Swank delivers long, carefully composed explications of Earhart's unorthodox attitude toward marriage and feminine autonomy, taken from her journal entries, in studied accents somewhere between those of the Kansas plains of Earhart's birth and those of Katharine Hepburn in her most famous trouser-wearing, gumption-gal roles. iReport.com: Share your movie reviews . ""Amelia"" dutifully conveys the salient biographical info with a trusty cinematic device: As Earhart and Noonan embark on their doomed flight, flashbacks catch the audience up on the events that got her there. (Christopher Eccleston, as Noonan, is the one understated player in this endeavor.) Those last 10 minutes or so of radio-communications loss, concurrent instrument failure, and dawning awareness of disaster are honestly gripping. But just in case the point isn't clear enough (She! Must! Fly!), throughout the drama composer Gabriel Yared lays on blasts of musical exclamations that are as distracting as sirens. Sometimes that music says, ""It's great to be in the sky and surfing the clouds!"" Sometimes it says, ""Look how pretty the landscape looks below -- kind of makes you miss the music in 'Out of Africa,' right?"" Sometimes the rumble of violins and horns hints, ""Uh-oh, we're getting to the tragic part of the story!"" Mostly, the busy orchestra backs up the starry cinematography to remind us, ""This slim, androgynous beauty, with her unusual love life and her driving need to take to the skies, sure was something, huh?!""

94,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The decision to make ""Che"" was an easy one, Benicio Del Toro says. Filming the movie was anything but. Benicio Del Toro stars as Latin American revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. ""I have to say it probably is the most difficult movie I've ever made, and I've made a few,"" Del Toro says of his starring role in director Steven Soderbergh's Spanish-language biopic. One of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Del Toro has made a name for himself playing dark and brooding characters in movies like ""21 Grams,"" ""The Usual Suspects,"" and ""Traffic,"" for which he won an Oscar. He now adds to that list the role of revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, an Argentine doctor whose role in the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s vaulted him to cult status where he remains today. To play the Latin American revolutionary, Del Toro says he had to start with the man himself rather than invent a character. He read what Che wrote and interviewed a range of people, including those who knew him when he was a child, as well as those who were there in his last days. And then there were the countless photos of the iconic and controversial leader which he pored over. Looking at the pictures, seeing the attitude that he had in the photographs,"" he says, ""I learned a lot from the photographs."" The meticulous study pays off on screen. Del Toro delivers a soulful performance that has earned him accolades. He won the Best Actor award at Cannes this year and he is being hotly tipped for another Oscar nod. Which films and actors do you think are contenders for this year's Oscars? Share your picks in the SoundOff below. Che's life ""is what movies are made of,"" Del Toro told CNN. The incredible story, along with the opportunity to work with Soderbergh, who directed him in 2000's ""Traffic,"" for a second time drew him to the project. The 41-year-old bilingual actor was born in Puerto Rico but grew up in Pennsylvania. It wasn't until he was in his early 20s and wandered into a bookstore in Mexico City that he discovered Che. ""I bought a compilation of his letters that he had written to his family and I read that book. I didn't know anything about this guy, so that started my journey,"" he recalls.  See how the movie was received in Cuba » . ""Che"" is split into two parts -- ""The Argentine"" and ""Guerrilla."" When shown in its entirety, the movie clocks in at a staggering 257 minutes. Part one charts Che's rise from young idealist to revolutionary hero during the Cuban Revolution. Part two depicts his efforts to bring change to all of Latin America and focuses on his campaign in Bolivia, where he died. Shot in various locations ranging from the jungles of Bolivia to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, filming was grueling. ""In this film, we went pretty fast,"" Del Toro says. ""We went really fast."" Soderbergh wanted to film using only natural light, and production moved rapidly. On some days, Del Toro recounts, they only had 15 or 30 minutes to capture a scene. One day of filming felt like a whole week of work, he says. ""The way I felt on a Monday in this movie is the equivalent to how I felt at the end of the week of another movie."" Del Toro, who also co-produced the movie, isn't complaining though. He speaks with pride about the effort the cast and crew put in to the moviemaking process, which he describes as ""hit and run."" ""Che"" is being released in two parts, but the epic is best viewed in its entirety, Del Toro says. ""You'll get the full experience of what we went through, of the two movies together as one.""

Kate Winslet and David Cross star in ""The Reader,"" which has received criticism from some quarters. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- One major contender's chances at Oscar gold may be damaged due to its sensitive subject matter. ""The Reader,"" which is up for five Oscars -- including best actress (for star Kate Winslet) and best picture -- is being slammed by ""Explaining Hitler"" author Ron Rosenbaum, who's asked Academy members to shun the post-World War II drama because the film ""asks us to empathize with an unrepentant mass murderer."" Rosenbaum, who wrote his commentary for Slate.com, said that's not his only reason. ""It gives the impression that ordinary German people only learned the terrible things that happened in the death camps in the East after the war,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""In fact, ordinary German people participated in Hitler's final solution, the extermination of the Jews -- it was no secret."" Read Rosenbaum's essay . Based on the German book with the same title, ""The Reader"" stars Winslet as Hanna Schmitz, a former Nazi prison guard living in postwar Germany. She meets and has a secretive affair with teenager Michael Berg (David Cross), who often reads aloud to her at her request. Unbeknownst to Michael, Hanna is illiterate. Their affair ends abruptly when she mysteriously disappears. Eight years later, Michael is a law student. One day, while observing Nazi war criminals on trial, he's shocked to find Hanna as a defendant in the courtroom. The court finds her guilty of killing 300 Jewish women during the war and sentences her to life in prison. While behind bars, Michael sends her books on tape, which, over time, help Hanna finally learn to read. Therein lies the problem for Rosenbaum. ""What essentially it did,"" said Rosenbaum, ""was celebrate the enrichment of a life of a mass murderer when she learned how to read. ... Imagine if there were a film about Charles Manson learning how to play chess and what a better guy it made him."" However, others in the Jewish community are applauding the film, including Ken Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Jacobson says ""The Reader"" opens itself up to criticism, but is worthy of an Oscar at the same time. ""I think it conveys a series of messages that actually are very powerful about the Holocaust, and it's not in the usual way,"" Jacobson told CNN. ""As time goes on, as we have Holocaust deniers emerging more and more, we need people to be able to relate personally to what happened,"" said Jacobson. ""I think this film does this in a very powerful way."" The Weinstein Company, the studio behind ""The Reader,"" says it is proud of the film. ""It is sad that some people misinterpreted the film's message,"" the company said in a statement. ""It is not about the Holocaust,"" the company added, ""it is about what Germany did to itself and its future generations."" Will Rosenbaum's piece, and the backlash he touched off, affect ""The Reader's"" Oscar chances Sunday? Entertainment reporter Tom O'Neil, who follows awards shows for the Los Angeles Times' TheEnvelope.com, doesn't think so. Given ""The Reader's"" five nominations, he believes Hollywood has already embraced the film. ""Oscar has taken special notice of 'The Reader' because it's not just your average Holocaust movie,"" said O'Neil. ""It doesn't beg for forgiveness when dealing with Nazis. It makes you think."" Still, Rosenbaum says any further accolades for the drama would be unfortunate. ""I would be very disappointed in the intelligence level of Hollywood if it gave the best picture award to 'The Reader,' "" he said.",0.66335857,3208
96,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Tyler Perry is known today as the first African-American to own a major film and TV studio. He's a pioneer whose own life story is a rags-to-riches tale that reads like a screenplay. Tyler Perry is the first African-American to own a major film and TV studio. Now a writer, actor, director and producer -- Perry's success grew out of a troubled home in a poor neighborhood in New Orleans, Louisiana. Strong on faith, Perry named his first play ""I Know I've Been Changed,"" after an old Negro spiritual. It was a gospel musical about two adult survivors of child abuse. In 1991, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he worked as a bill collector and eventually scraped together enough money to rent a small theatre and stage the play. With only 30 people in the audience, the play was a flop. For the next several years, he struggled and was often broke and sometimes lived in his car. But Perry refused to give up. He finally got a second chance in 1998, when a promoter booked the show in the Tabernacle, a former church turned concert hall in downtown Atlanta. It was a sold out hit and the little boy from inner-city New Orleans was well on his way. Perry then took his plays on the road and traveled the so-called ""chitlin' circuit"" to theaters in Memphis, Tennessee, Detroit, Michigan, and Baltimore, Maryland -- where black entertainers historically performed for predominantly black audiences. He began making a name for himself with African-Americans. In 2004, he started looking for backers for his first movie project ""Diary of Mad Black Woman,"" a story about a devoted wife in a bad marriage. He said he faced a wall of ignorance when he pitched white executives in Hollywood. One told him the project was doomed to fail at the box office because the core audience for Perry's stage plays -- black churchgoers -- wouldn't go to the movies. Another said the dialogue for his characters was unrealistic.   Though he was largely unknown to white audiences, Perry refused to play by Hollywood's rules and demanded creative control of his projects.  Tour of Tyler Perry's back lot » . He was resigned to bankrolling the project himself and selling it as a DVD when he got a call from the independent studio Lionsgate. They struck a deal and he made ""Diary"" for about $5 million. The movie earned 10 times that at the box office. Since then, Perry's movies have grossed nearly $400 million and he's developed a loyal following. He now demands not only creative control but also ownership of the finished product. Still, it's just the beginning, he said. ""I don't necessarily feel like I've arrived."" Even so, Perry has a prolific output of stories, including his movies ""Why Did I Get Married,"" ""Meet the Browns,"" ""The Family that Preys,"" and ""Madea's Family Reunion."" He signed a $200 million deal with TBS (owned by Time Warner, the same company that owns CNN) for 100 episodes of ""House of Payne,"" one of television's most popular shows among black adults. The sitcom is now in syndication, making even more money for Perry. Perry said ownership of the finished product is key to building wealth, a principle he hopes other African-Americans will embrace. How are entertainment heavyweights changing black stereotypes?  ""If you want to think about longevity,"" he said, ""if you want to think about your family and generations down the line, then you have to own it."" And own it he does. Tyler Perry Studios, on 30 acres in Atlanta, is his black Hollywood. But he is quick to acknowledge his debt to the legendary black actors from an earlier generation by naming two of his soundstages after Sidney Poitier and Cicely Tyson. He has also helped introduce them to a new generation by casting Tyson, 76, an Oscar-nominated actress, in two of his films.  Tyson opens up about life, career » . A study by the NAACP found that African-Americans are ""underrepresented in almost every aspect of the television and film industry,"" but Perry is able to hire on both sides of the camera. On his production crews, black employees are getting unprecedented career opportunities, and black actors are portraying characters beyond the predictable drug dealers and thugs. ""What makes me feel great is to be able to pull up to this place and to be able to have 300 people working and running around, trying to get things done,"" he said. ""That makes me feel great."" His greatest accomplishment, he said, has nothing to do with business. ""It's more personal than that for me,"" he said. ""My biggest success is getting over the things that have tried to destroy and take me out of this life. Those are my biggest successes. It has nothing to do with work."" The NAACP has honored Perry with its Image Award, but there are some who believe his characters don't portray African-Americans positively. ""He's made a lot of money, but the quality of work is sorely lacking,"" said Todd Boyd, a University of Southern California film professor and culture/media critic. Some of Perry's characters rely heavily on exaggerated personalities and slapstick comedy. Boyd is particularly critical of Perry's recurring character, Madea, an over-the-top grandmother who smokes marijuana and brandishes loaded guns she keeps in her purse. Perry himself plays the tough, buxom matriarch, who runs at full throttle fueled by country wisdom and ghetto strength. ""It seems a bit ironic that at the moment of the first African-American president, the most popular African-American figure in the media is a man in drag engaging some of the most stereotypical images of African-Americans ever created,"" Boyd said. Perry said his critics are missing the point. ""They miss the messages of empowerment,"" he said. ""Sure, the silliness of 'Madea,' the silliness of 'Brown,' it's broad, it's over the top. Great. Fine. I get it. But how can you miss the message of forgiveness? How can you miss the messages of empowerment? ""I would love to share with them the letters that I've gotten from people. 'This helped me get through a tough time.' 'I was gonna commit suicide.' 'My husband and I weren't speaking until we saw ""Why Did I Get Married?"" It saved our marriage.'

97,"(CNN) -- She added smart to sexy as a Bond girl opposite Pierce Brosnan's 007, and proved her dramatic and action credentials in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"" but for actress Michelle Yeoh, life and acting are both all about balance. Michelle Yeoh: ""There are reasons why you do movies. It's for the love of it."" ""I think it's very boring for my audience, just to see me in the regular roles. I love my action films. And I think right now, I have a nice balance,"" she told CNN's Talk Asia. Poise and balance are something that Yeoh is naturally blessed with. Her childhood dream of becoming a professional ballerina was dashed when she sustained an injury while training at the Royal Academy of Dance in London. However, she continued to study completing a degree in dance and a minor in drama, before serving as Miss Malaysia at the age of 21, which was more of an ambassadorial role for the country's tourism industry than bikini modeling. Making her film debut in an action movie in 1984, she made further appearances in Hong Kong action films doing her own stunts, until she married millionaire Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon in 1988 and put her career on hold. On giving up acting for the sake of her married life she said: ""At that time, it's very difficult to try and juggle a normal life, be where your husband is, try to start a family life, and filming months on end in another country. So I weighed my options. I am a person that believes, you have to give your all. There's no half measure in doing things. You do it well or at least you've got to give it your best shot."" The couple divorced three years later and Yeoh resumed her film career in 1992 in the Jackie Chan smash-hit ""Police Story 3."" While she continued to use her athleticism in her roles and do her own stunts, in the pursuit of playing good characters and that all-important balance, she credits the directors she has chosen to work with. ""I look at the scripts and you can understand where the story is going ... but it's a director with a vision that brings it to life,"" she said. ""There are reasons why you do movies. It's for the love of it or you're thinking of your paycheck. And you have to find your own balance."" When it came to doing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" Ang Lee was the essential ingredient. ""I did it really because I adore Ang Lee. That's a true film maker, where they move you, they bring you to places where you can't imagine but want to be."" But being an all-or-nothing person has taken its toll when it has come to the stunts she has performed. Yeoh tore her anterior cruciate ligament after the first sequence she performed for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which meant that only the dramatic scenes in the film could be shot until she had recovered. Yeoh has turned her attention to producing as well as acting and found it a challenging experience. ""As an actor you would be judged on how your performance is and so that's where your focus is. It's a very selfish environment and that sense, because as you know, you can't make excuses afterwards. But as a producer, you have to make sure everyone is well protected and everyone is safe. And if anything goes wrong, it's all on your shoulders,"" she told CNN. The films she produced, 2002's ""The Touch"" and ""Sliver Hawk"" from 2004 were panned by critics, but she makes no excuses: ""That's the nature of the business. You should never take these things personally when it works or doesn't work."" And when it comes to passing on what she's learned to young Asian actors, her advice is typically practical. ""For any Asian face, or any Asian girls that have dreams, aspirations or doing crossover work in Hollywood, you must have the language. These are your tools. And then afterwards, the right face, the right demeanor, and the right chemistry.""",0.66100204,6698
98,"(CNN) -- Science fiction flicks featuring aliens can be a little formulaic: Aliens invade American territory, mass destruction ensues, and nine times out of 10, Will Smith rides to the rescue . A company operative (Sharlto Copley) gets an alien's attention in ""District 9."" But the alien-infested ""District 9,"" opening in theaters Friday, takes things in a different direction -- if the producer may say so himself. ""It's utterly original,"" producer Peter Jackson -- yes, ""Lord of the Rings"" helmsman Peter Jackson -- told Entertainment Weekly. ""In an industry that's looking to make movies out of every obscure TV show, or sequels, or video games, you look at 'District 9' and it's unlike anything you've ever seen,"" he said. With its inventive plot and crowd-pleasing special effects, the low-profile, relatively low-budget ($30 million, a pittance these days) film was a hit at Comic-Con, creating a buzz before the film's release. The brainchild of newcomer Neill Blomkamp, ""District 9"" is a mash-up of the director's love for science fiction with his rearing in an apartheid-divided South Africa. Set and shot in the shantytowns of Johannesburg, the film is a mix of action-movie shock and sociological food for thought. The mayhem begins when an alien spaceship runs out of fuel over South Africa in 1981, and simply hovers idly in the sky. With no attack forthcoming, officials finally evacuate a group of aliens -- it turns out they've fled their home world -- and corral them into barbed-wire ghettos, effectively separating the shrimp-like creatures from the human populace. Overseeing the aliens' camp is the corporation Multi-National United (MNU). It's an obvious nod to South Africa's own violent and divisive history, but director Blomkamp says he isn't aiming for political commentary. ""This is an organic thing that has grown out of me living in South Africa. I didn't want to go, 'Here's a whole bunch of people that have been oppressed by this apartheid-esque society' and beat people over the head with it,"" he told CNN. ""I wanted to say, 'This is the city I grew up in, and this is what it felt like,' with a science fiction veneer to it so that it doesn't take itself that seriously."" Documentary-like authenticity was of prime importance to Blomkamp, and was the reason for his casting of fellow South African unknown Sharlto Copley as leading man. Copley has no prior acting experience, but critics have lauded his portrayal of Wikus van de Merwe, a private-sector employee who goes from being the oppressor to one of the oppressed after an accidental run-in with some DNA-transforming alien goo. ""Having grown up in South Africa, I was exposed to the tail end of apartheid as a child, [and] it's something I felt I could relate to,"" Copley said. ""Playing the character, I saw so clearly how you discriminate. ... The film deals with things that are fundamentally human."" ""District 9"" is also fundamentally a thriller, and there's no shortage of gory, gritty scenes and clever special effects that will appeal to fans who like a little action with their sci-fi. Indeed, the film has been praised for its masterful use of special effects, weaving the technology seamlessly into the documentary-style scenes. Sometimes the two are in the very same shot, Blomkamp said. ""One of the first shots completed was a motherboard shot, where [computer-generated imagery] was incorporated into some of the handheld footage, and it felt like it was working, this idea of handheld stuff with [CGI],"" Blomkamp said. ""It set a good tone; it captured the essence of what I was going for."" Not bad for a 29-year-old novice, who had previously directed short films and commercials. But that body of work was impressive enough to catch the eye of A-list producer Jackson, who originally had Blomkamp in mind for feature version of Halo, the video game. ""[Jackson] had received all of the crazy short films and commercials I had done, and once I met him and hung out and got familiar with the kind of filmmaking universe he set up down there, he did sign off on me as director of 'Halo,' "" Blomkamp recalled. But, five months into the project, the plug was pulled on ""Halo."" ""Right away, [Jackson] said, 'If you want, you can stay in New Zealand and we can just keep the momentum going and allow another film to take place,' "" Blomkamp said. One of Blomkamp's friends suggested his short film, ""Alive in Jo'burg,"" for feature treatment. Blomkamp ran with the concept, developing it alongside fellow screenwriter Terri Tatchell into ""District 9."" ""It's pretty cool,"" Blomkamp said. ""I would've packed my bags and left had [Jackson] not said that."" It's been more than two years since Blomkamp started the project, and though he's found the experience exhausting, he has quite a final product to show off. ""There is nothing better than to come out the end of that process and have it play in a movie theater,"" he said. ""For that first film, I got what I had set out to do, [and] that's a pretty awesome feeling."" CNN's JD Cargill contributed to this story.",0.6599901,6316

""I promise, you won't be disappointed,"" said Travolta, who plays a deranged ex-inmate who takes hostages on a New York subway.

101,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Brad Pitt gets top billing in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds,"" but Austrian actor Christoph Waltz may have turned in the most memorable performance as a Nazi ""Jew Hunter."" Christoph Waltz attends a special screening of ""Inglourious Basterds"" in New York. Waltz, a 52-year-old veteran of German television, was hardly known outside of Europe, until now. Tarantino, insisting on actors with geographic origins similar to their characters, chose Waltz to play a complex and unforgettable villain: Nazi Col. Hans Landa. Landa mixes charm, humor and intelligence with great cruelty and opportunism as he travels through Tarantino's unpredictable screenplay. Waltz calls Landa ""one of the great villains in dramatic literature."" His performance earned Waltz the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, but the actor credits the writer for creating a ""multifaceted and layered"" character. ""It's what Quentin [Tarantino] has written, and let me tell you, that's plenty,"" Waltz said. ""Because I could still be sitting there trying to figure out what else is in there. And it's bottomless."" The opening scene of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is itself a short film in the style of a spaghetti western, starring Waltz as ""The Jew Hunter.""  Watch the stars of the movie discuss the film » . ""It was pure Tarantino to me in that it blended so many different elements perfectly, of tension and comedy, dialogue and excitement,"" actor B.J. Novak said of the scene. Waltz's character uses three languages in his encounter with a French dairy farmer who was hiding a Jewish family under his farmhouse floor. ""The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a Jew, where they can only think like a German or, more precisely, a German soldier,"" Landa tells the farmer. Landa's motivation is more complex than the typical Nazi depicted in a past movies. A literature scholar could build a career around studying the character, Waltz said. ""Landa is one of the great villains in dramatic literature from the very beginning, for specific reasons, and it's a real job to find out the reasons,"" he said. ""You sit there and you study and you study."" The role provided him ""ample opportunity to show other sides,"" Waltz said. ""That's the fantastic thing with Landa, is it's so multifaceted and layered."" But Waltz said he will be careful about repeating a similar role. ""This is the best villain there is, and now it has to be significantly different for me to consider,"" he said. His three-decades-long acting résumé shows the diversity of his talent. His 1996 portrayal of Roy Black, one of Germany's most beloved pop stars, earned him one of Germany's highest acting honors. Waltz, now with a Hollywood agent, hints that scripts are coming his way because of the ""Inglourious Basterds"" exposure. One disadvantage of playing the villain in a Tarantino film is that the director insisted that Waltz not pal around with cast mates while away from the set. ""It might be a good idea not to establish this buddy-buddy situation, to keep everybody on their toes a little bit,"" he said. ""That awkward distance that they kept from me made it easier."" Pitt, however, did approach him early in the filming, he said. ""The fact that he is one of the biggest stars didn't come into that equation after he eliminated it,"" Waltz said. ""He approached me literally with open arms, and that was that."" ""Inglourious Basterds""-- rated R -- hits theaters Friday, August 21.",0.6574055,5795

103,"(CNN) -- There is a lot of excitement around the potential of ""stereoscopic"" movies (""3-D"" to you and me). Much of it has been drummed up by director James Cameron's forthcoming blockbuster ""Avatar"" and Dreamworks boss Jeffery Katzenberg, who is releasing more than a dozen 3-D pictures this year. The title character looks over a note from her ""other parents"" in ""Coraline."" After seeing ""Beowulf"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" two recent entries in the 3-D sweepstakes, it was easy to conclude that this fad wouldn't last any longer than it did last time around, in the 1950s. But after seeing the captivating ""Coraline,"" the first stereoscopic stop-motion animated feature, I've changed my mind. Maybe this really is the next phase for motion pictures -- and what's more, maybe that's not such a bad thing. In the hands of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" director Henry Selick, 3-D isn't a gimmick or the ocular equivalent of an obstacle course. It's an aesthetic enhancement, layering the story and literally bringing depth and texture to the visuals. Adapted by Selick from Neil Gaiman's novella (the same Neil Gaiman who co-scripted ""Beowulf,"" incidentally), ""Coraline"" is a contemporary fairy tale about a bored, blue-haired 11-year-old kicking around a big old house in rainy, empty Oregon. Her parents are writers. They basically leave her to her own devices, so when Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) discovers a diminutive door hidden behind the wallpaper, her mom (Teri Hatcher) agrees to fish out the key, revealing ... a brick wall. It's only at night, when she dreams, that the door magically opens to a tunnel, and Coraline passes through to the house next door: a fabulous mirror image of her own home, right down to an identical mom and dad. Identical, except that these parents give her pancakes, presents and their full attention. That, and the buttons stitched into their skulls where their eyes should be. Any parent will immediately recognize that this ""other mother"" and ""other father"" are too good to be true (they're prettier and more talented, and they obviously don't work for a living), but Coraline is entranced by the dazzling, super-saturated night-world, with its garden of snapping dragons, a circus of performing mice and all the treats she can eat. In her dreams, the grass isn't just greener -- it's emerald. In one of Selick's embellishments on the novel, there's a facsimile of the only other child in the valley. He's an irritating boy named Wybie, who's very much improved in his all-smiling, mute incarnation, in Coraline's opinion. At least until he musters up a scowl ... Selick's movie can be intense and even disturbing; it could easily freak out impressionable adults, let alone their offspring. But I prefer to think of it as a feel-good movie for overworked parents. There's also a redoubtable talking cat (voiced by Keith David) to ensure that everything will come out all right. Tapping into primal fantasies and fears, the film also echoes classic fantasy stories from the Brothers Grimm, Lewis Carroll and L. Frank Baum. The tunnel suggests the rabbit hole Alice fell down, and the crazy mirror manner in which the ""other"" world reflects back on reality reminds us of the doubling of actors in the film version of Oz. ""Coraline"" isn't perfect. I could have done without either the downstairs neighbors -- two elderly showgirls -- or the acrobatic Russian barker upstairs (a little carny goes a long way). But the whimsy is always offset with comic mischief and the menace of Hatcher's genuinely creepy Other Mother. The model work is extraordinary in its eccentric, jury-rigged genius. A shower spouts rusty water -- fabricated from plastic, apparently. And if you examine the blooms in Other Father's garden too closely, you might see they have been fashioned from popcorn. You can't taste it -- not yet -- but in its 3-D incarnation (about half the movie's release prints will be in traditional 2-D), you'll feel you could reach out and touch. With an dreamily sinister and seductive score by Bruno Coulais, ""Coraline"" never stops taking artistic risks. I hope there's a brave enough audience out there willing to take the plunge. ""Coraline"" runs 100 minutes and is rated PG. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.",0.65629095,2524

""It's interesting because I avoided working with my dad for a while because I was so sensitive of being accused of the idea of nepotism,"" he said. ""I remember when I was 19 years old I started a desk calendar company to pay for my first short film just so I could say one day my daddy didn't pay for my first short film.

105,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- He's been a homicidal singing barber in ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" and a drunken swashbuckler in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Depp is back as bank robber John Dillinger, revered in the Depression as a modern-day Robin Hood. Now, Hollywood shape-shifter Johnny Depp is back as another unexpectedly charismatic outlaw: Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger, a character he says he's been drawn to since he was a boy. ""I sort of had a fascination with John Dillinger when I was about 10, 11 years old, for some reason,"" Depp told CNN. ""I always kind of admired him, oddly."" Oddly, perhaps, because for a short but intense period between September 1933 and July 1934 Dillinger and his gang rampaged through the American Midwest, staging jail breaks, robbing banks, and killing 10 men and wounding seven along the way. Dillinger's violent spree is the focus of gangster drama ""Public Enemies,"" the latest offering from director Michael Mann, and also starring Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. Mann is known for his sympathetic portrayal of criminals, and Dillinger -- whose acts on the wrong side of the law led him to become one of America's first celebrities -- is the quintessential good hood. In the 1930s, the United States was in the grips of the worst financial disaster in history -- a time when many Americans watched their life savings disappear and became jobless and hungry. Members of the public blamed banks for losing their money and politicians for failing to stop them. For many, Dillinger's exploits represented sticking it to the fat cats, and he was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood. J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director at the time, may have made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy No. 1, but the bandit was careful not to alienate the public. There is a memorable moment where he drapes a coat over a female bank hostage during a raid to keep her warm. Also, it's said he never swore in front of women. He was always courteous even as he tried to meet his target of robbing banks in under two minutes. Crucially, he never robbed the average guy, telling him to put his money away during robberies. It is this Dillinger that Depp captures: a captivating revolutionary with the gift of  gab who lit the public's imagination, causing people to flock to cinemas to watch his exploits in weekly newsreels. Review: Depp is great in 'Public Enemies' Of course, the dark, violent side of  Dillinger's psyche is unavoidable. Depp plumbed the depths of his own character to come up with those murkier elements. That was something that took courage, according to Mann: ""He had Dillinger in him; that's something I sensed. Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness."" Depp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters. He shook off an early reputation as a teen pin-up in movies like Tim Burton's 1991 Gothic tale ""Edward Scissorhands."" He went on to cement his reputation for unusual film choices and quirky performances in films like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2005) and ""Finding Neverland"" (2004).

Mann filmed in many of the locations where Dillinger's story took place almost 80 years ago, including the Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago, where the bandit was finally shot dead by FBI agents as he came out of a Clark Gable movie. They also shot at Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters in the far north of Wisconsin, the site of one of Dillinger's most famous showdowns with the FBI. Dillinger was hiding out there after a botched robbery. When the feds finally caught up with him, two men were killed in the vicious gunfight. ""We were able to shoot not just in the actual place where this happened, but in his actual room,"" says Mann. ""There's a certain kind of magic for Johnny Depp to be lying in the bed that John Dillinger was actually in."" A lot of Dillinger's success was down to superior guns and getaway cars. Depp, who has experience shooting guns from previous productions, had to learn a completely different technique for the heavy guns of the time. Depp says shooting the Thompson submachine gun was one of the highlights of the production: ""When you've got a beast like that strapped to you and you're emptying magazines, a 50-round drum, it's a good feeling."" The ride may have been thrilling for Depp but he also recognizes that the Depression-era setting has some extra significance these tight-belted times. ""You know,"" says Depp, ""We're in the middle of a recession, teetering on a depression. It's time to view the banks and grown-ups for what they are.""",0.6537151,5043
107,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- In ""Marley & Me,"" it doesn't take long to learn why Marley, an incorrigibly frisky golden Labrador retriever adopted by Florida newspaper writers John and Jenny Grogan (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston), is the ""world's worst dog."" In ""Marley & Me,"" Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston's characters welcome a dog into their lives. He's friendly and lovable, but he devours everything in sight -- drywall, socks, big chunks of furniture (no, he doesn't just chew on them, he eats them). As a dog owner, I can testify that ""Marley & Me,"" based on the real John Grogan's smash 2005 memoir, is the single most endearing and authentic movie about the human-canine connection in decades. As directed by David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada""), though, it's also something more: a disarmingly enjoyable, wholehearted comic vision of the happy messiness of family life. John and Jenny share an existence that, from the standpoint of our current economic times, already looks like paradise. He's a reporter who gets refashioned, by his testy editor (Alan Arkin), into a lifestyle columnist (only to keep complaining about it -- poor guy!). She's a feature writer who becomes a stay-at-home mom. As the kids come along (three of them), the Grogans move into bigger and bigger houses, yet they have thwarted ambitions, fights that go on for days, and a general attitude of wistful loss toward all the freedoms they have given up to become parents. ""Marley & Me"" celebrates two ordinary people as they try to fit love, work, children, and one volcanically misbehaved pooch into a single space. Marley may be the dog from hell, but we're meant to see that the Grogans, in their hearts, wouldn't have it any other way. Marley stands in for all the unruliness that can never be domesticated out of life. You can domesticate Owen Wilson, but the shock is how good the role of beleaguered breadwinner looks on him. He and Aniston forge a nimble connection (they even get mad in style), and Wilson has a scene near the end with Marley that's the most wrenchingly tender acting of his career. Using his scratchy, lackadaisical warmth to voice a testament to family, and to where dogs fit into it, he makes you feel like it's a wonderful life indeed. EW Grade: A- .

108,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jon Hamm has a confession to make: He hates his hair. Jon Hamm poses with his partner, Jennifer Westfeldt, at the premiere of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" That may come as a surprise to fans of the actor, whose slick-backed hair is part of his signature look on ""Mad Men"" -- the show that just earned him another Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a TV drama. In the new movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" Hamm sports a slightly different 'do, with his bangs combed rakishly over one eye. It was in the context of promoting the sci-fi remake that Hamm revealed his tonsorial frustration. ""It's the bane of my existence. Goofy hair,"" he said in a self-deprecating interview with CNN. ""It never looks good ... It's a pain."" Hamm says he's always worn his hair long, but had to cut it for AMC's TV series, in which he plays a 1960s Madison Avenue ad executive. He says stylists on the show, armed with hair spray and blow dryers, mold his coiffure into a hard shell. Helmet hair has come in handy at work. ""I've had a piece of the set fall on my head and my hair didn't move,"" he said. ""I had seven stitches in my head and my hair didn't move. That's impressive."" Whether it's his hair, good looks, acting chops or a combination thereof, Hamm's star is on the rise in Hollywood. Apart from his co-starring role in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" Hamm recently completed work on the murder mystery ""The Boy in the Box.""

110,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The romantic comedy ""New In Town"" puts co-stars Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr. at odds through most of the film. But behind the camera, the story was completely different, the pair told CNN. Harry Connick Jr. and Renee Zellweger enjoyed working with one another on the set of ""New In Town."" ""I had a great time. [Connick is] such a nice guy. He shows up on set and makes everyone laugh, and it's just a nice day at work,"" Zellweger said. Connick agreed, saying the off-camera friendship with his co-star made the on-camera experience an enjoyable one. ""Renee is the type of person that I got to know quickly. Well, I became friends with her quickly. She's a very mysterious, wonderful young lady,"" Connick said. Directed by Jonas Elmer, the film follows Zellweger as Lucy Hill, a Miami, Florida-based corporate shark who travels to a small Minnesota town to oversee the closing of a small factory. Upon arrival, Lucy clashes with the factory's union representative, Ted Mitchell, played by Connick. As the two begin to understand one another, their icy relationship soon melts into romance. But the romance between Lucy and Ted is only one side of the story. Zellweger said she was instantly drawn to the role for its humor. ""I loved the physical comedy part of Lucy Hill's experience. I laughed out loud when I imagined the scenarios, and I could not wait to go and play around with that,"" she said, ""I wanted to go to work every day and laugh, and I did."" Famous for her roles in such comedies as ""Nurse Betty"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" Zellweger is no stranger to the comedic scene. With ""New In Town,"" the actress was eager to once again play a part that would make audiences laugh. ""I think the laughter, that's therapeutic,"" she said. At a time when the country is struggling through a financial recession, Connick said, ""New In Town"" provides that necessary therapy. While the film centers on the troubles of one rural American town, it showcases a dilemma familiar to the entire country. ""I think there's a good balance of what people are really feeling right now, and you walk away from this movie with a real feeling of hope and like, 'We're going to be all right,'"" he said.

Unlike the previous effort in which the Oscar-winning duo went on a shooting spree across several European countries, the new film takes place in just one locale, Rome.

Watch the excitement of shooting in Rome » . Hanks and Howard sat down with CNN to talk about the challenges -- and ""blessings,"" in Hanks' word -- of making ""Angels & Demons"" happen in one of the world's most densely trafficked, architecturally powerful cities. Tom Hanks: You're shooting in a place like Rome and quite frankly, every layer of history and every passer-by, every scooter, every truck adds to the ambience of the film, the production value that you couldn't get in a million years if we were trying to fake it during the daylight hours back home. Ron Howard: We used every device known to cinema, from the latest cutting-edge technology to certain filmic illusions that go back a hundred years, literally to the birth of the medium, to sort of low-budget street photography where you['re] just pull[ing] up in a car, getting out a van, clearing a little space and shooting a shot. And I hope that it does the thing that these kind of adventures should do, which is really transport an audience. Hanks: Every step of the way we seem to be enjoying the blessings of how complicated it is to shoot in a place of Rome. We had a lady show up who was getting married at the Pantheon, and she had to get to the altar, and we had to get our shots. She showed up right between shots when we were moving the cameras. We got her into her wedding day.

112,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A schoolteacher from southern England with no previous filmmaking experience has given amateurism a good name by directing her pupils in a feature film fit for Hollywood. Alice Ralph, 18, stars in ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" as Bathsheba Everdene. It has taken a year of hard work using only one camera, but teachers and pupils at The Gryphon School in Sherborne, Dorset, recently premiered their 110-minute long adaptation of English novelist Thomas Hardy's seminal 1874 work ""Far From the Madding Crowd."" ""When I watched it for the first time, it was actually quite an emotional experience,"" director/producer and Head of Drama Rosita Clarke told CNN. ""It's a kind of relief to see the efforts of what you've worked on and achieved an absolute reality."" Clarke is the driving force behind the project and says many people didn't believe she would be able to pull off a feature film when she first came up with the idea. ""Miss Clarke pitched the idea, and said she was going to make a feature film and we all thought she was joking,"" said 18-year-old Ben Jones, a Gryphon student, who plays Sergeant Troy in the film. ""But we all kind of went along with it and it's turned into this."" Clarke was inspired to make the feature after she directed a play with some film footage in it the previous year. ""I thought to myself, 'I'm going to make a film,'"" she said. After getting permission from the school, Clarke sat down with Hardy's book during the school summer holidays and over two weeks wrote a screenplay. In August 2008, Gryphon's Hardy feature went into production. ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" unfolds against the backdrop of rural 19th Century England and tells the story of beautiful Bathsheba Everdene who inherits a farm from her uncle and finds herself loved by three men. The feature was filmed over weekends, holidays and snatched evenings after school. It is full of exquisite costumes, gorgeous Dorset vistas and faultless acting from students aged between 16 and 18-years old. Despite the demands of the shooting schedule, the students say they were able to fit in their schoolwork around it. ""As far as the study goes, it's been ok,"" said Jones. Watch CNN The Screening Room's Myleene Klass report on the Gryphon School's London premiere . The pupils involved say it didn't undermine their studies, and in some cases helped it by giving them an invaluable experience in an industry they would like to work in in the future. ""Some of us want to get into the profession and this experience has been really valuable,"" said Jack Buckley, 18, who plays shepherd Gabriel Oak. ""We haven't done any film acting before and it's very different to stage acting so we've learn a lot about that."" But the experience has not been without challenges: Using just one camera Clarke and her team had to film a fire in a 19th Century hayrick [haystack], work with livestock including sheep and shoot large crowd scenes. In total 130 pupils worked on the film in roles from hair and make-up to walk-on parts. Alice Ralph, 18, who stars as Bathsheba, says acting for the camera was one aspect that took some getting used to. ""At first I found it really hard to get used to the camera. I found it really awkward,"" she said. ""I remember the first shoot. I couldn't even say my lines."" Emotional scenes shot up-close requiring convincing tears and restrained acting also proved a challenge for the students who are used to acting on stage. ""The emotional scenes were actually really difficult,"" said Ralph. ""I found them quite hard to get, with the crying and things but with Mrs Clarke's help she put me in a situation and I'd use emotional memory and I'd get there in the end."" Clarke had no experience of filmmaking when she started up and used the Internet and books to learn about lighting and camera angles. She also picked up some tips on camera work from her 21-year-old son, Sunny, a broadcast production student. Sunny also edited the film and Clarke says he had the editor's final word and helped her to keep the film slick. ""I wanted as many students as possible to have a little showing, and he's looking at it from a professional level of final finish."" The film cost a little over $11,000 (£7,000) to make, much of which Clarke raised from banks and supermarkets in the local community. ""We haven't had money and we couldn't get the sound right all the time and it got dark too quickly because we were trying to get it all done and it's just been so pressurized,"" says Clarke. Nevertheless, she was always convinced she would successfully complete the film --  ""It wasn't ever not going to happen."" For Clarke the best bit of the film is ""the success for the students. What they're feeling. What they must be feeling. That just blows me away. ""That's what makes me proud and if I've helped them on their way.""",0.6444672,7094
113,"(CNN) -- Achtung, baby! Sacha Baron Cohen stars as a flamboyant Austrian fashionista in ""Bruno."" There's a British theory that everything sounds funnier delivered with a Teutonic accent. That's tested to the limit in Sacha Baron Cohen's newest provocation, ""Bruno,"" but it's not what comes out of his mouth that makes the Austrian fashionista such a handful. The man in the tight yellow lederhosen knows that in our visually overstimulated culture, a picture is vorth a thousand vords. More if there's significant skin involved -- and he's happy to show us his wurst. Cohen seems to believe that prudery is the enemy. Certainly, bad taste is his Trojan horse. An early montage of romantic coupling, Bruno-style, is enough to get tongues wagging -- or clucking in disapproval. It's the closest thing to gay porn most heterosexuals will see this side of ""300."" Either way, Cohen's laughing: Properly managed, outrage is a useful marketing tool, as ""Borat"" showed. Apparently permanently airbrushed right down to his backside, Bruno looks nothing like his hirsute Kazakh cousin, but the men share an ego; they're equally insensitive to other people and oblivious to notions of social decorum and the politically correct. And they both invest heavily in the American Dream. Bruno hungers after fame as hungrily as Borat lusted for Pamela Anderson. After a brief prologue in Europe -- and the distressing revelation of the vacuity of the fashion scene -- he sets out for Los Angeles, determined to become Austria's ""biggest superstar since Hitler."" Perhaps inspired by another Cohen creation, Ali G, he sets out to make a celebrity interview show -- but sadly, the only dupes ignorant enough to participate are ""American Idol"" judges (Paula Abdul chats about her philanthropic pursuits while perched on the back of an immigrant laborer) and presidential candidates (take a bow, Ron Paul). It's not just about the scarcity of the guests, though. Bruno doesn't draw them out the way Borat did. Quite the opposite: Mostly they're wary and guarded, or downright hostile -- and understandably so, often enough, given Bruno's shock tactics. Yes, it's funny seeing him fire up a predominantly African-American TV studio audience by announcing that his ""adopted"" black baby is named O.J., but still, the scene tells us more about Cohen's need to provoke than about the crowd's supposed homophobia. The same goes for his brief stint in a U.S. Army training facility. The actor's quick wit and virtuoso physical comedy skills carry the day, but just as Bruno is forced to abandon one dead-end celebrity scheme after another, the movie too seems to be casting about haphazardly for some real comic traction. Evidently it's not easy testing taboos in 2009. Wherever Bruno turns, he seems to be following in someone else's footsteps. Peace talks in Israel (what Bruno calls ""Middle Earth"")? Morgan Spurlock has been there, done that. Camping out with the gun lobby? Michael Moore, ""Bowling for Columbine."" Gay conversion? Didn't director Larry Charles go there with Bill Maher just last year in ""Religulous""? Meanwhile, Bruno's love-hate relationship with his assistant, Lutz (Gustaf Hammarsten), only highlights how similar the new film's few narrative pegs are to ""Borat."" Some sketches do hit much closer to home. A series of interviews with stage moms and dads who eagerly sign up their infants to work with hornets, wasps, dead or dying animals, antiquated heavy machinery and sundry toxic substances is a real jaw-dropper, though the kicker is tempered by Bruno's behavior. And, to its credit, the film saves the best for last. In a show-stopping climax (which I don't propose to spoil here) Cohen puts it all on the line and definitively nails gay-bashers where it hurts: right between the eyes. iReport.com: ""Bruno"" vs. Borat"": Preview audience weighs in . It's an elaborate -- and brave -- stunt by which Bruno ultimately achieves the fame he craves.

114,"(CNN) -- In ""Street Kings,"" Keanu Reeves' bad-boy cop Tom Ludlow may not play by the rules, but the film sure does. Keanu Reeves, second from left, and Forest Whitaker are shifty cops in ""Street Kings."" The movie is textbook Cop Noir. Directed by David Ayer, who wrote ""Training Day"" and directed ""Harsh Times,"" from a script that originated with ""L.A. Confidential"" novelist James Ellroy, it's a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again. Too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world, betrayal, disillusionment, retribution, all that jazz -- isn't told with much originality this time around. As Ludlow, a detective with a special LAPD vice squad, Reeves shoots first and asks questions much, much later. In his field the bad guys are easy to spot, and if Tom has to get his hands dirty, well, then he'll be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in. He works from the gut. We have Ludlow's number from the beginning: He wakes up, vomits, cleans his gun, and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka. Then he crashes a kidnappers' den and puts down four gangsters before they know what's hit them. ""Don't worry,"" he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back. ""I'm a cop."" It's probably superfluous to add that he's still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago. It's also probably superfluous to mention that Internal Affairs (headed by Hugh Laurie) is beginning to sniff around Ludlow's unit. In particular, IA is talking to his ex-partner Washington (Terry Crews), a revelation that sends Ludlow reaching for his baseball bat. Before he can put Washington straight, though, his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks. Can Ludlow cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers? Hell, yes, even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before he's through. Reeves doesn't do much ""acting"" as such, but he doesn't need to: His performance is clean and spare, in synch with Ayer's clipped economy, and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly naïve character. Alcoholism doesn't appear to have thrown off Ludlow's aim any, but it must have dulled his reasoning. A broody, intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head-scratching, but Ludlow never stops to look even two steps ahead. (I guess he's not a James Ellroy fan.) But what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination, not to say blood-lust. In a neat touch, when it's time to cool off his public profile for a spell, the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory, and, obviously, an utterly pointless occupation. Forest Whitaker boosts the energy level as Ludlow's paternalistic mentor, boss, and No. 1 fan: ""You're the tip of the spear,"" he tells him. ""Who else is going to hold back the animals?"" Violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined, ""Street Kings"" ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of ""a necessary evil,"" or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself, but ultimately it can't conceive of a better alternative. After all, the rest is politics, a game that even the most hard-boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter. And, besides, he's seen it before.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel fall in love -- for a time -- in ""(500) Days of Summer."" Five hundred days is the duration of their relationship, but the movie presents those days out of order, as an impish romantic flipbook, so that we keep skipping forward and back -- from, say, day 8 to day 154. Most romantic comedies have half a dozen situations at best: Meet Cute, Infatuation, Pop Song Montage, Contrived Mix-Up, Angry Breakup, and Final Clinch. ""(500) Days of Summer"" is about the many unclassifiable moments in between. Director Marc Webb, working from Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's witty script, stages each scene as a vivid snapshot memory, and his sense of play is boundless. The film leaps in a heartbeat from the furtive glances (and shared fixation on the Smiths) that ignite an office love affair to a rooftop-party reconciliation that plays out, via split screen, in two simultaneous versions (how the hero wants it to be and how it happens) to a morning-after-the-first-sex saunter that evolves, with joyful hilarity, into a musical number scored to ""You Make My Dreams."" This has to be the first movie ever to give equal props to Morrissey and Hall & Oates. ""(500) Days"" is like a mood ring cued to the ups, downs, and confusions of modern love. It's a Gen-Y ""Annie Hall"" made by a new-style Wes Anderson who uses his cleverness for humanity instead of postmodern superiority. None of it would work, though, without such lived-in performances. Deschanel makes the lovely, sensuous Summer just precocious enough to know what she wants without coming out and saying it, and Gordon-Levitt, with his junior Springsteenian chin jut, lets you read every glimmer of hope, pain, lust, and befuddlement beneath his nervy facade.

116,"(CNN) -- You don't need to be a teenage boy to realize how scary girls can be. Girls know it too. Megan Fox plays a demonic cheerleader in ""Jennifer's Body,"" written by Diablo ""Juno"" Cody. Certainly Diablo Cody does. The Academy Award-winning ""Juno"" scribe proves as much in her second screenplay, a horror comedy about BFFs Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried). These bosom buddies have a relationship that stretches back to the sandbox. They're inseparable opposites: Jennifer is a babe, head cheerleader and a bit of a snot. Needy is nerdy, conventional and a soft touch. Except that when we first meet her, she's locked up in the local mental hospital, kicking back at the guards and muttering darkly about the murders that put her here. Looking back, she dates this disastrous turn of events to the day Jennifer talked her into seeing an up-and-coming indie band at the roadhouse. The gig ends in a deadly inferno that claims the lives of several schoolmates, then Jennifer drives off with the band for an al fresco after-party involving satanic rites and virgin sacrifice. She survives on a technicality, but shows up later that night at Needy's place covered in blood, barfing blue goo and craving fresh flesh. In the days after the tragedy the entire school seems to be suffering from post-traumatic stress. Only Jennifer seems unfazed by the community's second sucker punch: the gruesome fate of the star quarterback in the woods. What's a girl to do if her best friend turns into a heartless boy-eating demon? Needy cleans up the mess and hopes it's just a phase. The last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was ""Twilight,"" which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller. Directed by Karyn Kusama, who made ""Girlfight"" and ""Aeon Flux,"" ""Jennifer's Body"" isn't anything like that. It's a much edgier, snappier, bloodier film, aimed primarily at young hipsters and horror fans -- plus anyone else curious to see Megan Fox get nasty. (That's got to include a sizable chunk of the audience, surely?) So smoldering hot that at one point she coolly sets fire to her tongue, Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's not hard to imagine she can have anyone who takes her fancy -- even Needy is not immune to her charms. Ironically, though, Jennifer is really the needy one here, while her friend eventually finds the self-possession to stand up to her. Similarly, you might come for Fox, but it's Amanda Seyfried's expressive range and toughness that leaves a more lasting impression. The ""Mamma Mia"" starlet is destined for good things. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Jennifer's Body"" The bitingly smart, funny teen-speak is carried over from ""Juno,"" along with sharp pop culture references and a sassy feminist attitude, but the million-dollar question has to be: Is it scary?

The gore scenes come with weird little flourishes: Jennifer's mounting body count attracts a crowd of curious woodland creatures, sounding a sweetly sick echo of ""Bambi,"" and a climactic showdown is set in a spectacularly fetid abandoned swimming pool (don't they drain those things?). But the jokiness does tend to undercut the terror. I suspect the film will prove too freaky for ""Juno"" boosters, and could have used more straight-ahead scares and sustained suspense to appease the hardcore horror geeks.

117,"(CNN) -- Three years ago, the film based on Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" was the focus of protest and controversy, with a Vatican archbishop calling for a boycott and Catholics at many levels refuting plot points. From left, actors Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor join director Ron Howard at the film's premier. But when it comes to the new film based on a Brown novel, ""Angels & Demons,"" star Tom Hanks says talk of controversy is much ado about nothing. ""Everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not,"" Hanks said of the film. ""I think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it's the second Robert Langdon mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it. And there is really not."" The movie ventures into similar waters as its predecessor, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" with Hanks reprising the role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology expert, and conspiracy theories galore. It also reunites the Academy Award-winning actor with director Ron Howard, who helmed ""Da Vinci,"" and teams Hanks with actor Ewan McGregor and Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer. While ""The Da Vinci Code"" centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the Louvre and the theory that a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced descendants, the new film features a murder at the Vatican and a secret and powerful society known as the ""Illuminati."" McGregor,  known for his role as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ""Star Wars"" films, said that while ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"" are inextricably linked, the latter can stand on its own. ""If I thought [Angels & Demons] was pinned to 'The Da Vinci Code' in some way then it would've been a lesser script to read and it wasn't,"" McGregor said. ""It's a standalone movie ... it's not relevant whether you've seen 'Da Vinci Code' or not."" Both films, like the Brown novels they're based on, have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling. ""I have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction,"" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League. ""You've got [Dan] Brown, [Ron] Howard and [Tom] Hanks in the movie all alleging that the Illuminati was this secret society which was brutalized by the Catholic Church in the 1600s."" ""It's all a lie,"" Donohue said. ""[The Illuminati] never even existed until May 1, 1776, but they have to pitch it back into the 1600s so they can trot out their favorite victim, Galileo. What happens is you get the audience thinking 'Well, maybe it's not all true, but probably some of it is true.' "" Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide and the Christian Film & Television Commission, first issued an advisory alert about the film in April and reiterated it days before the movie's May 15 release. ""Now that we've previewed 'Angels & Demons,' Movieguide has decided to keep in effect our caution alert,"" Baehr said. ""Faith is often denied throughout the movie."" Director Howard wrote in the The Huffington Post that he believes Donohue is on a mission ""to paint me and the movie I directed, 'Angels & Demons,' as anti-Catholic,"" a claim Howard emphatically denies.

118,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- They've been called ""bromances"": those buddy films and TV shows, such as the movies ""Pineapple Express"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" that feature non-sexual but deep friendships between two or more males. Jason Segel and Paul Rudd star in ""I Love You, Man,"" which opens Friday. The forthcoming ""I Love You, Man,"" which opens Friday, appears to fit the bill. In the film, Paul Rudd plays a man who needs a best man for his wedding but has never made any male friends. Enter Jason Segel as Sydney Fife, whom Rudd's character, Peter Klaven, pursues on several ""man-dates"" that end up threatening his relationship with his fiancée (Rashida Jones). But don't call the film a ""bromance"" in the presence of Rudd and Segel. ""We hate that word,"" Segel told CNN. ""It was not part of the lexicon while we were filming,"" added Rudd. Still, both actors have plenty of experience in the, uh, guy-pal genre. Rudd has been in several comedies written, directed or produced by Judd Apatow, considered one of the leaders of the ""bromance"" trend with his softer, more openly emotional male characters. Segel has also been in Apatow projects -- including last year's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" -- and he stars in the TV series ""How I Met Your Mother,"" which finds plenty of humor in male bonding. Segel observes that what helps the films work is the discomfort of two men trying to talk about their emotions while hoping to maintain a dispassionate, hard-edged, prototypically manly façade. And he knows he's good at bringing out that discomfort in his co-stars. ""Judd Apatow told me that my special skill was that I am able to maintain my likability while getting incredibly close to the creepy line, and that's what I should try to cultivate,"" he said. ""That's what he does,"" Rudd noted. ""He just holds [the moment] a little too long."" ""It's the fraction of a second too long that makes people uncomfortable,"" Segel added. In ""I Love You, Man,"" Segel's character is rougher and looser than his characters in ""Sarah Marshall"" and ""How I Met Your Mother."" He welcomed the change. ""It was a real treat for me, to be honest for a minute, to play this character, because I've played sort of a puppy dog guy in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' and on ['Mother'] I play a husband, you know, a loving husband,"" he said. ""So to get to play a character who is a bit more of a man of mystery was very exciting for me."" In real life, claims Segel, he even has a man cave. ""It's filled with puppets,"" he said. ""And I keep wondering why I don't have a girlfriend. I'm like, 'hey, this is my house; come check it out. This is where I keep my 40 puppets.' ... I think that I have a reputation for being weird because of that."" But he quickly turns serious and maintains that ""I Love You, Man"" does have a message to go along with its comedy. ""I think we both had something to learn from each other,"" he said. ""Paul's character had to learn that it's all right to take a little distance from your significant other and have some dude friends and someone to vent to about things you can't necessarily talk about with your girl."" ""Sometimes buddies hold a mirror up to the way you behave in ways that relationships with the opposite sex don't,"" Rudd said. ""Yeah, and my character had to learn that maybe it's time to grow up a little bit,"" Segel added. So, this ""bromance"" thing, allowing a few feelings to show. Perhaps it's not so bad after all? Rudd says that the idea has its upside, despite its name. And he's glad it's been successful. ""That's us in a nutshell, not macho, not tough,"" he said. ""I think that we've all been kind of drawn to real stories, you know, characters that hopefully people can relate to and what's funny about just certain insecurites and just certain things in life. ""They could easily be dramatic,"" he pointed out. ""Just less fart jokes.""",0.6372274,4453
119,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- He immortalized the ""smell of napalm in the morning"" in ""Apocalypse Now,"" but Robert Duvall's first meeting with director Francis Ford Coppola was no indication of the fruitful relationship to come. Duvall starred in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" ""The Godfather: Part II"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" It was 1969 and Coppola had parted ways with a lead character in indie film ""The Rain People."" He was stuck and 38-year-old Duvall was drafted in at the last minute on the suggestion of a friend. Despite slapdash beginnings, their work together has produced some of Duvall's greatest roles and many of Coppola's most critically-acclaimed films. Duvall started working in theater in the 1950s before moving into film in the early 1960s with roles like Boo Radley in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Things took off for him in 1970s when he starred in Coppola's multiple award-winning movies ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II,"" But, it is his Oscar-nominated turn as indestructible, napalm-loving Lt. Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war opus ""Apocalypse Now"" that remains one of Duvall's most enduring roles. Duvall sits down with CNN's Revealed and talks about, ""Apocalypse Now"" and his relationship with the master movie-maker. Revealed: Can you sum up the impact Coppola had on your life, your career? RD: I would have had another career. He helped all our careers with ""The Godfather."" It was a kind of catalyst for all the actors in one and two. It helped me. I kinda designed my own career. Revealed: What's Coppola's approach to directing? RD: I think sometimes Francis works best amidst confusion and I mean that in a good way. He'll come in and say, 'Let's try something,' and then you rehearse. Like any good director he sees what you bring. He realizes it's gotta come from the actor. He's open enough ... of course, he'll give his opinion but he wants to see what you bring. Revealed: The problems Coppola encountered while shooting ""Apocalypse Now"" are legendary. What was it like working on that film? RD: There are things I won't go into! But it was pretty crazy. Sometimes we'd get one shot in a day, if that. Everything was in disarray. The hurricane came in and ruined the sets, s**t! Then they had to build them again, and we were there nine or 10 months. Dennis Hopper all doped up, not doing it Francis' way. Francis would do 45 takes, and then he said, 'Now, would you please do one my way,"" he'd say to Dennis. Martin Sheen got the heart attack, and they didn't know what they would do if they lost Martin. Francis said it was like warfare.  Watch Coppola and others talk about the making of ""Apocalypse Now"" » . Revealed: You say that people constantly come up to you in the street and say the line, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' RD: It is a pretty famous line. Everybody relates to that line. Scenes like that we had to get quickly because all that fire at the back of me was supposed to be the napalm. Sometimes when you work fast and under duress ... sometimes that's the best stuff you can get. Revealed: How did your life change after ""Apocalypse Now,"" and the ""Godfather"" films came out? RD: It was kind of a landmark. I said we're in something pretty important here, as far as film goes and it was true, and I gained a lot of respect for Francis because I didn't know him that well on ""The Rain People."" It's Coppola's vision. It could have been made by Disney as long as he was directing it. Which one of Coppola's films would you put in a time capsule for future generations? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . Revealed: What is it about Coppola that makes him such a great director? RD: A guy like Coppola, you know, as a director, he wants to see what you bring, without dictating. He's not a dictator. He has a definite vision, but he's not going to get in there and say it has to be my way or the highway. He really wants to see what you bring. He'll say, 'Come on guys quit fooling around we gotta make a movie!' You branch off into laughing and making jokes, but that's good for the set and he knows that too. It's his own gift and it's his own way of working. Revealed: Coppola says now he wants to make small, intimate movies he has written himself. What's your take on that? RD: He's a big spender. Now he's making all the wine and everything else, he can go back to independent film. Why not? He said ""The Conversation"" was his favorite film. It was certainly one of his best, I think. Why not go back to what he started out as? In the 1970s it was as if the independent filmmaking community was within the establishment. Now it's back outside the establishment starting to make the kind of films he started out doing. Revealed: Can you describe Francis in a few words? RD: A talented maniac. No, no, not a maniac, but he's a talented, driven guy. He's a heavy hitter.",0.6370452,5192
120,"(InStyle) -- Drew Barrymore keeps evolving -- from star to producer, and now director. Drew Barrymore sat down with InStyle for its October issue, on newsstands Thursday. The 34-year-old actress earned critic's attention with her uncanny portrayal of ""Little Edie"" Beale in HBO's ""Grey Gardens,"" and her directorial debut, ""Whip It,"" has been hailed as a success well before it rolls into theaters October 2. But, at her core, she's still the irresistible free spirit we all know and love, as she revealed in the October issue of InStyle. On being a celebrity ... Barrymore said that while she loves her life, there are still moments she battles with being a celebrity. ""Some days I want nothing more than a brilliant mask so I could look like someone else and go wander the streets and be free,"" she said. ""I'm very peeved that Halloween only comes once a year."" On exercise... When it comes to transforming her body for a role, as she did for ""Grey Gardens,"" the sunny actress is nothing but dedicated. But in everyday life, Barrymore aims for balance and body acceptance. ""I don't have the time or discipline or interest in having a perfect-10 body. I work out, I eat right, but I'll always be a little bit of Jell-O on a pole."" On her relationship with her mom ... Barrymore admitted her relationship with her mom is a topic she doesn't readily discuss, but the central love story between a girl and her mom in ""Whip It"" caused Barrymore to reflect on her relationship.""I am OK with my dad, but my mom and I have yet to work it all out,"" she said, adding that she doesn't talk about it because ""how do you talk about something you're confused about?"" On girl power ... From ""Charlie's Angels"" to her new all-girl roller derby flick, it's no secret that Barrymore champions female friendships. ""I like teams -- I like buddies. I don't understand women who are competitive, apart from positive forums like athletics. One person is a powerful thing, but a tribe is unstoppable."" On her first fashion faux pas ... Barrymore is known for her ever-evolving, ever-eccentric style, but said anything she donned during the ""E.T."" era can be labeled as a fashion faux pas. Or can it?  ""Velour and taffeta, together? Oh, no, no, no. Now I think it's brilliant."" On her first broken heart... Barrymore recently broke up with The Strokes' drummer Fabrizio Moretti, and called the five-year relationship one of the most important in her life.

121,"(CNN) -- Three years ago, the film based on Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" was the focus of protest and controversy, with a Vatican archbishop calling for a boycott and Catholics at many levels refuting plot points. From left, actors Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor join director Ron Howard at the film's premier. But when it comes to the new film based on a Brown novel, ""Angels & Demons,"" star Tom Hanks says talk of controversy is much ado about nothing. ""Everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not,"" Hanks said of the film. ""I think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it's the second Robert Langdon mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it. And there is really not."" The movie ventures into similar waters as its predecessor, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" with Hanks reprising the role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology expert, and conspiracy theories galore.  Watch Hanks talk aboout the controversy » . It also reunites the Academy Award-winning actor with director Ron Howard, who helmed ""Da Vinci,"" and teams Hanks with actor Ewan McGregor and Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer. While ""The Da Vinci Code"" centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the Louvre and the theory that a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced descendants, the new film features a murder at the Vatican and a secret and powerful society known as the ""Illuminati."" McGregor,  known for his role as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ""Star Wars"" films, said that while ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"" are inextricably linked, the latter can stand on its own. ""If I thought [Angels & Demons] was pinned to 'The Da Vinci Code' in some way then it would've been a lesser script to read and it wasn't,"" McGregor said. ""It's a standalone movie ... it's not relevant whether you've seen 'Da Vinci Code' or not."" Both films, like the Brown novels they're based on, have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling. ""I have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction,"" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League. ""You've got [Dan] Brown, [Ron] Howard and [Tom] Hanks in the movie all alleging that the Illuminati was this secret society which was brutalized by the Catholic Church in the 1600s."" ""It's all a lie,"" Donohue said. ""[The Illuminati] never even existed until May 1, 1776, but they have to pitch it back into the 1600s so they can trot out their favorite victim, Galileo. What happens is you get the audience thinking 'Well, maybe it's not all true, but probably some of it is true.' "" Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide and the Christian Film & Television Commission, first issued an advisory alert about the film in April and reiterated it days before the movie's May 15 release. ""Now that we've previewed 'Angels & Demons,' Movieguide has decided to keep in effect our caution alert,"" Baehr said. ""Faith is often denied throughout the movie."" Director Howard wrote in the The Huffington Post that he believes Donohue is on a mission ""to paint me and the movie I directed, 'Angels & Demons,' as anti-Catholic,"" a claim Howard emphatically denies. The director told CNN that he attempted to reach out to the Catholic Church regarding the film, but had no success. He also downplayed reports that Rome and the Vatican tried to hinder filming.

""There's something just kind of attractive about that, those kinds of qualities to me, and I just thought it would be fun."" ""Planet 51,"" which also features the voice work of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Justin Long and Gary Oldman, opens Friday. Biel sat down with CNN to talk about the film, the challenges of voice work and the difficulty of finding good roles for actresses. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Why did you choose to do something animated? Jessica Biel: I think I chose this part because I'm kind of a kid at heart and I really thought the story was so sweet and fun. ... I wasn't doing anything. I was able to work in town, at home in L.A., which is so rare. CNN: You could probably wear your pajamas to work. Biel: Pretty much. Roll in, no hair and makeup. I just always wanted to be a voice in some great movie where some little girl loves my character. CNN: Did you get to meet [your co-stars] when you were doing the voices? Biel: I never saw them, never met them. I mean, I know Dwayne, I've known Dwayne for a long time. I met Justin before, but I never saw them once. It was such an interesting experience to be there by yourself kind of going through it. But ... it goes fast. You're there, it's fast, it's fun. CNN: Who's your character? Biel: I play Neera, who is this lovely 16-year-old girl. ... She's insecure about boys but also has a sense of confidence for herself, very independent, and is not listening to what the government is saying about this alien [the Earthling] who's landed on her planet. She is standing up on her own two feet, thinking for herself. ... So she's, you know, she's trying to find out who she is as a woman. CNN: You do have a strong female character and it's such a good role model for young girls. Is it hard to find that in films today? Biel: It is. It's very hard. I mean, honestly, it's just rare to find a story about a woman's experience, about a young girl's experience. For some reason nobody wants to make those movies. And it's really hard because there are so many talented women and there are not enough projects for everybody to really blossom and explore. So it's quite competitive because there's a small amount of material. CNN: Is it hard for Hollywood to write those kinds of roles? Biel: I don't know what it is.

123,"(CNN) -- Asked about part of the entertainment business he particularly enjoys, Greg Behrendt -- stand-up comedian, author, TV writer and producer -- had an unusual answer. Greg Behrendt co-wrote ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" based on a popular episode of ""Sex and the City."" ""My instrumental punk and ska band called the Reigning Monarchs,"" he said with a laugh. ""There's seven guys in the band. ... We play shows around Los Angeles."" But the co-author of ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" now a film starring Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johansson and Ben Affleck, admits that stand-up comedy remains a longtime passion. In fact, it led -- in a roundabout way -- to ""He's Just Not That Into You."" ""I was a stand-up who had an HBO special called 'Mantastic,' and it was directed by Michael Patrick King, who became an executive producer of 'Sex and the City,' "" Behrendt said. One thing led to another, and Behrendt soon joined a mostly female writing team on ""Sex and the City."" He observed that he was the only straight male writer for the show and offered the group valuable and realistic insight into the world of men. ""Sure, I felt a little bit like a token,"" he said. ""It's not like those women needed my help, but I think there are days when you can't write in a perspective you don't live."" That perspective, along with colleague Liz Tuccillo's female point of view, gave way to ""He's Just Not That Into You."" The book is based on a popular episode of ""Sex and the City,"" in which Carrie's boyfriend (played by Ron Livingston) offers the line to Miranda as she puzzles over a date. The book is a wake-up call for women who obsess and worry about relationships, with an overarching message that if women find themselves doing the chasing, it's likely the guy simply isn't interested. ""We were raised to pursue women. ... Most of the guys I know enjoy the pursuit,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean women should be wallflowers."" As a comedian-turned-relationship expert -- one who is, by the way, now happily married and writing a book with his wife -- Behrendt said he hoped women would realize their worth when they read the book or watch the film. ""[Women] deserve great things, and they get to decide what their relationships are, and not other people,"" he said. ""You often hear women say, 'I don't know if he's ready to get married.'

In ""Up,"" a curmudgeonly senior citizen, Carl, tries to cope with the enthusiasm of Russell, a young boy. Not that there's anything wrong with an animated film tugging at our tear ducts. But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds. They gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway. That leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters. No, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of ""Up"" » . Such misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, ""Up"" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials. There's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes. And there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or ""Wilderness Explorer"" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around? ""Up"" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs. But if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth. Russell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm, haplessly helpful. He's the mirror image of the child Carl used to be, if only the old man were capable of recognizing it. But instead of looking around him, Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Up"" Written by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- ""Up"" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance.

""After a few days of seeing people stranded on roofs, we had to do something,"" said Lessin, who with Deal had previously worked with Michael Moore.  Watch Lessin and Deal talk about how the film was made » . So they set out, planning to do a film about New Orleans National Guardsmen. But when that was shut down -- "" 'Fahrenheit 9/11' screwed it up for all you guys,"" she remembered hearing -- they found what she called ""an unexpected gift"" in Kim and Scott, whom they met 10 days after the storm. The home video material, coupled with archival news footage and film verite capturing the couple's journey, led to the documentary ""Trouble the Water,"" which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and is up for an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards. Lessin and Deal, who both directed and produced this documentary that took two-and-a-half years to make, spoke to CNN about their Ninth Ward collaborators, their own experiences and the impact the film's made. CNN: Tell me about meeting Kim and Scott. Did you know right away that you were on to something? Tia Lessin: We were in a Red Cross shelter in central Louisiana -- that's where we met the subjects, the hero[es] of our film. They'd been on this five-day journey out of the city to higher ground. ... Everyone had a story to tell, but their story really rose to the top. Carl Deal: They called themselves ""street survivors."" Kim said the most support and help they ever got from the government were the skills to survive on their own. They were used to not getting assistance. ... It's a slap in the face for those of us who come from a more privileged place. ... And the home video, it enabled us to ground the film in this inside point of view. CNN: I can't imagine what it was like to work on this. What was this experience like for you? Lessin: Originally the film was fueled by a sense of outrage. What it became, I guess, was something a little different. It's really about hope and survival. We were inspired by Kim and Scott's journey, and their commitment to do something different in their lives. The voices on 911 calls, we think about those people all the time, and there's no way to know what happened to them. What keeps us up at night now is that people are still struggling. Levees are still vulnerable, there's a lack of affordable housing, lack of jobs. Schools are a dismal failure. Tens of thousands of people can't return home. We hope in this new administration, things will happen. CNN: What did you hope this film would inspire in terms of emotion and action? Deal: We want to challenge people, when they see it, to think about themselves and the impact they can have in the community and the world. People respond to this film in different ways. We screened at the Democratic National Convention in Denver. Mayor [Ray] Nagin [of New Orleans] came to the screening and walked out after a few minutes. Sen. [Mary] Landrieu, had a completely different response and tearfully embraced Kimberly. Lessin: We get hundreds of e-mails from strangers every day, about how they're using the film in classrooms, in churches, on college campuses to organize trips [to volunteer] in New Orleans.  They're inspired to act. All of America, our hearts went out [after Katrina]. There's still a real connection. People want to know what's happening. They care deeply about the story and are appalled the Bush administration did so little and hope the Obama administration does better. CNN: How much do you think politics, and issues popular to the time, influence Oscar wins? Lessin: I would hope that the best film wins. It's an extraordinary pool of nominees. [That said, ""Trouble the Water""] does resonate. It's about people who beat the odds and survived. And that's what we're all trying to do. Kim and Scott showed us how to do it with grace and dignity. CNN: I imagine the film's success has in many ways turned Kim and Scott's lives upside down. How are they doing today? Lessin: They're rebuilding their community. They started a record label, Born Hustler Records. Kimberly is carnival royalty [at Mardi Gras]. They're hometown heroes, as well they should be. They're living where they weathered the storm, but they're in a no-flood zone. iReport.com: Who do you think will win?",0.6295312,5992
129,"(CNN) -- The AMC series ""Mad Men"" has been honored for its sharp writing, polished acting and engaging portrayal of life at a New York advertising agency in the early 1960s. ""Mad Men"" has gotten attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. It has also been much noticed for something else: its fashion sense. The series, which features all the looks of that era -- thin-lapeled suits and skinny ties, crinoline-puffed dresses and pencil skirts, Peter Pan collars and subdued pinks and greens -- has attracted attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. Banana Republic, which has placed ""Mad Men""-inspired clothes in its window displays, is even offering a walk-on role for the winner of a contest. ""Mad Men,"" which returns for its third season Sunday, isn't the first Hollywood creation to influence fashion trends. For decades, movies and television shows have played a primary role in dictating people's fashion choices, whether they've been aware of it or not. Here are a few examples. 1. In the 1934 film ""It Happened One Night,"" star Clark Gable took off his shirt and showed his bare chest, instead of the standard white undershirt. For decades, an urban legend has maintained that undershirt sales dropped up to 75 percent, not to recover until World War II. Though the mythbusting site Snopes.com says the truth is uncertain, it's testimony to the legend's strength that we're still talking about it 75 years later. 2. The 1967 film ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" with its (somewhat idealized) Depression-era fashion, continues to inspire today's designers. Faye Dunaway's berets, scarves, trench coats, fitted cardigans and long pencil skirts were a hit at the time and remain so today. 3. ""Annie Hall"" boldly showed women that the masculine preppy look was attractive. Star Diane Keaton wore baggy pants, dress shirts, a vest and tie in the 1977 Woody Allen film. The film is said to have influenced a spike in tie sales for women. 4. ""Saturday Night Fever"" rejuvenated a fading disco craze in 1977 and told men it's OK to wear crotch-hugging pants, wide-open, chest-baring shirts and large medallion jewelry. John Travolta's white polyester suit -- later bought by film critic Gene Siskel at auction -- became a disco-era icon. 5. The 1983 film ""Flashdance"" made active wear -- like a ripped sweatshirt off one shoulder, tight leggings and leg warmers -- sexy for women in the early 1980s. Actor Jennifer Beals is said to have cut the collar off a sweatshirt that had shrunk in order to get it over her head, according to the Internet Movie Database. 6. The 1980s TV series ""Miami Vice,"" with its lightweight fabrics and pastel colors, proved a hit on television and in menswear departments. Star Don Johnson's signature look -- T-shirt, suit jacket, linen pants and shoes worn sockless -- could be seen all over the country. (He also popularized the unshaven, stubble-bearded look.) 7. ""Sex and the City"" trendsetter Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, talked about her shoe addiction constantly during the HBO series, which ran from 1998 to 2004 and spawned a 2008 movie. Soon, stilettos -- paired with a thrown-together look -- became something the cool crowd of viewers would follow, along with brands such as Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo. 8. A game show starting a fashion trend? It happened with ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" which featured host Regis Philbin sporting a monochromatic shirt-and-tie look. Later, he launched a line of shirts and ties in the Regis by Van Heusen collection.",0.6279696,6671
130,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- For most people life can be boiled down to a few major decisions and a list of truly memorable events. Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams hope love conquers all in ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Typically, these are first words, first steps, graduations, births, weddings and -- of course -- marriage proposals. More than a few of these milestone moments take place in the new romantic drama ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Of all of them, perhaps the most memorable is a scene in which Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) asks Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) to be his wife. It's a complicated request because Henry, a kind man, also has the uncanny and often unfortunate ability to be transported suddenly and unexpectedly from one time period to another, leaving Clare on her own. It's a peculiar set of circumstances that would give most women understandable hesitation when contemplating a marriage partner. But Clare is a woman in love, an emotion that tends to trump all others.  Watch how Bana and McAdams found humor in the scene » .

132,"(CNN) -- James Cameron unveiled his much-hyped, wildly-anticipated 3D sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" to audiences in full in London Thursday. Here's what the critics are saying about the Oscar-winner's first outing since ""Titanic,"" the most successful film of modern times. Todd McCarthy, Variety: The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in ""Avatar,"" and it's very much a place worth visiting. ...delivers unique spectacle, breathtaking sights, narrative excitement and an overarching anti-imperialist, back-to-nature theme that will play very well around the world..."" Mike Goodridge, Screen International: ...once again takes cinema to a new level of remarkable spectacle ... An epic film born entirely of Cameron's imagination, ""Avatar"" uses tailor-made technology to create the most astonishing visual effects yet seen on screen and blends them seamlessly into a mythical sci-fi story about an ancient alien civilization fighting the encroaching human menace. It's an unprecedented marriage of technology and storytelling which is on the whole remarkably successful. Chris Hewitt, Empire: It's been twelve years since ""Titanic,"" but the King of the World has returned with a flawed but fantastic tour de force that, taken on its merits as a film, especially in two dimensions, warrants four stars. However, if you can wrap a pair of 3D glasses round your peepers, this becomes a transcendent, full-on five-star experience that's the closest we'll ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. Wendy Ide, The Times: ""Avatar"" is an overwhelming, immersive spectacle. The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical otherworld that keeps us fascinated. At times it verges on the tacky, like a futuristic air freshener advertisement with the color contrast turned up to the max. The ethically accented orchestral score certainly doesn't help matters. But mostly, it's a place of wonder full of exotically freakish animal composites -- iridescent lizard birds, hammer-headed rhinos -- and sentient vegetation. ""Avatar:"" We shouldn't really be telling you this -- but it's good. Mark Brown, The Guardian: Perhaps most surprising was the politics. At one stage the deranged general leading the attack, with echoes of George Bush, declares: ""Our survival relies on pre-emptive action. We will fight terror with terror.""",0.6238764,8823
133,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- He is iconic, there's no doubt. George Hamilton gets his life story on screen in ""My One and Only."" With the elegant suit and tie, the impeccable grooming, the tan (Did I mention the tan?), George Hamilton is still a charmer, and he comes across like a born bon vivant. Sure, his acting may have taken a backseat to his bronzed visage years ago, but what did happen to him years ago? Well, there's a story there, one now coming to the big screen. Hamilton's formative years are loosely depicted in the film ""My One and Only,"" opening in wide release September 4. ""My One and Only"" has the style of a film produced during Hollywood's golden age, but the tale is easily relatable to today. In the film, Hamilton's mother, Anne, played by Academy Award winner Renee Zellweger, walks in on her bandleader husband and another woman. She hits the road in a brand new Cadillac Coupe de Ville with her two sons, George and Robbie, en route to find a new husband and a new life.  Watch a preview of 'My One and Only' » . Hamilton, 70, spoke with CNN about the film, old Hollywood and his mother. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: There is a lot of heartache in this story. Why did you want to share it? George Hamilton: I don't know that I really did want to share it. It's a fictional story based on a real story loosely about me. And I went to the movie to hate it. And I looked at the movie and I thought, my God, [Zellweger] looks nothing like my mother, but she was able to portray the emotions just the way it was then. I couldn't speak. I was completely overwhelmed by what Renee did. That's a great actress. CNN: Do you think that your mother shaped your life more than your father? Hamilton: I think they're kind of like sand and a rock, kind of -- you keep rubbing up against them and they form you. I knew that I was the man of the family from the time I was 10, 12 -- you know, I had to be. But I knew I had to get away from it. So I signed onto military school. Then my mother said, if you're bad I'm sending you to your father, and I said, send me. I ... lived a whole year with my father -- I got to know him, I got to understand the two sides to the story. My mother didn't say bad things about him. I presumed that he was this foreign person who left and abandoned us. He didn't at all. And when I made it in Hollywood and I didn't want to be an actor, there they arrived. It was their triumph, not mine. I wanted to be a doctor. CNN: Now in hindsight, do you understand what your mom was doing? Hamilton: That's a very good question. No, I didn't, I didn't get her. What I knew was I would work -- I was ... with people who had millions of dollars, and they just accepted me, and I would go out and buy a tuxedo in the thrift shop, and go to the coming-out party of a very wealthy socialite, and they would say oh, now chic. You wore your grandfather's or your father's tuxedo. And I had bought it for $5. And I realized there was a whole reverse way of acting, and people just presumed you were old money, and I played that. That was my game. But when I looked at my mother I realized that she was born almost like a child, with the theory that we would be divinely supported. Always trust that, don't be afraid. Poverty, or [being] poor, is a mentality, it's like fog, it's all around you. My mother was broke, but that's just a temporary deal -- that's a bad hand in the poker game, if you're gonna sit through two more you can win. And that's how I looked at it. CNN: What was old Hollywood like? Hamilton: Well, it was mythological. It was a place [that] the first day, I saw Robert Mitchum sitting at a table and he looked at me and said, ""I know they say I don't know my lines. It's not true. I'm just too drunk to say them."" And I thought, oh, that's an interesting man. Next Fred Astaire walks by, ""Hello,"" and I stopped: ""Hello, Mr. Astaire"" -- God I love that guy -- and I see Cary Grant sitting down. And he said, ""You've got a nice suntan. Do you like the sun?"" I said ""Well, yeah, I love the sun."" ... He was so incredible. And I saw Gary Cooper, Ty Power, Clark Gable, and then they disappeared. You talk about ""Gone With the Wind,"" Hollywood disappeared! And I had envisioned this because I was the last of the contract players, and I wanted to be like them, but they were gone! And all the sudden I'm seeing Marlon Brandos, and Monty Clifts, and then a whole generation of soft young men, the Beat Generation or whatever. I couldn't relate to them then. Because I had related to what my mother and brother had seen years before. And that's all I ever wanted to be. CNN: There can never be another old Hollywood. Hamilton: No, but there can be older people in Hollywood, and that's where I am now. Just before death they turn you into an icon. And the other day I got a star on Hollywood Boulevard and I thought, God this is pretty good, and then it scared me because I thought, they give these things to you before it's all over. CNN: And did you learn to love acting? Hamilton: Acting has always been something for me that's been a romp. I just show up and I have a good time, and I hope that I get through the day and I can have lunch in the sun. I used to take the script and if it was heavy I'd give it to George Peppard and if it was nice and light, if it was a western, a few words, I'd take it. That's the way I looked at it. I wasn't a great actor, it wasn't my style. I just loved being an actor.",0.62340945,6194
134,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as ""The Simpsons Movie"" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont . Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. ""We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,"" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. ""What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,"" he said. ""We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie."" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, ""The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive."" Its creators hope that ""The Simpsons Movie"" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, ""This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get."" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, ""When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof. I don't know what that says about humanity, but we do like to see cartoon characters hurt themselves and there's quite a bit of that."" But how have Springfield's finest led the field for so long? Groening believes that a large part of the Simpsons' success is down to the traditional animated techniques used to create it -- and that its hand-drawn charm puts the movie ahead of its CGI rivals. He told CNN, ""The difference between our film and these other films is that we have no penguins, okay? So that's the big difference. (Although we do have one penguin.) ""But the other thing is, our film is done the old fashioned way. It's got a lot of errors and flaws in it. These computer-animated films -- and I love them -- are perfect. They're spooky, they're so good. Ours is a way for us to honor the art of traditional animation."" Al Jean thinks that the series' success is also down to its wide appeal. He says, ""I have a two year old and she loves the Simpsons already, just because of the way it looks and the family. And then on the other hand, we do satirical references that only an adult would get."" A large part of the appeal of ""The Simpsons"" comes from its ability to portray the more touching moments in family life, like Jean's favorite moment in the movie. ""It's a scene where Bart is really mad at his father,"" he told CNN. ""He's sitting in a tree outside the Simpson house at night. He looks over and sees the Flanders house and thinks how wonderful it would be if he lived there. It's just really sweet: there's something really warm about that scene."" Groening, who has been meeting fans worldwide while promoting the movie, said that the Simpsons phenomenon has excelled his wildest dreams. ""It's not just the numbers,"" he told CNN. ""The numbers are good, but it's the intensity and the tattoos. The tattoos are freaky. You know? And it's not all just Bart and Homer. You'd think it would be just Homer. I talked to this one guy and he had Millhouse, and I said, 'Oh my god, Millhouse!' and he said, 'Yeah, everybody gets Bart.'"" While Groening never expected the series to run for so long, he told the Screening Room he has no plans to quit while it's ahead. ""The answer is, 'No end in sight! No end in sight!'"" he said. ""We're having fun, we hope the audience has fun, and as long as that's true, we'll continue doing the show."" Jean believes the show has proved it has longevity. ""I'm sure [it], like Mickey Mouse, will live on and on,"" he said. And he also hopes the Simpsons' success will continue. ""In terms of new episodes, we're doing another season after the movie comes out for sure, and then the casts' contracts expire, but I'd love to get another three seasons and maybe another movie,"" he said. But what is the legacy of this much-loved yellow family? Matt Groening sees the film as the culmination of two decades of hard graft. He says, ""I want to make sure that everyone who's ever worked on this show is proud of their work on this movie, so this rewards the writers, the animators, the actors. It's basically a celebration of twenty years of The Simpsons."" E-mail to a friend .",0.62339133,4444
135,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- You don't find many churches making theatrical films. You especially don't find many churches making films starring Kirk Cameron about a firefighter in a crumbling marriage addicted to online porn. Kirk Cameron stars in ""Fireproof,"" a film he was attracted to for its many themes, he said. But that's the case for Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. In fact, the film, ""Fireproof,"" was the church's third movie. It was also an unexpected hit. In September it debuted at No. 4 at the box office, eventually bringing in $33.5 million and spawning two books: a novelization, also called ""Fireproof,"" which is in The New York Times' best-seller list's Top 20; and a companion journal to the movie, ""The Love Dare,"" which has sold more than 2 million copies. Last week ""Fireproof"" debuted on DVD and climbed to No. 3 on Billboard's DVD chart, beating out ""The Hulk"" and ""Saw V,"" among others. ""You don't often see movies made by churches do big numbers,"" said Billboard's Anthony Colombo. ""Having [distributor] Sony behind it helps. Having Kirk Cameron helps, but for it to come out and do 136,000 pieces [DVDs] in its first week is pretty impressive."" ""It should not be working,"" said Alex Kendrick, one of the pastors behind the film. ""All I can say is we prayed for months and asked for it to honor God."" Kendrick said that Sherwood's pastors gathered for prayer two years ago and asked God to give them an idea for their next movie. They were just coming off making ""Facing the Giants,"" a movie shot entirely in Albany on a $100,000 budget. It starred no professional actors -- just members of their church -- but made $10.2 million at the box office and sold 250,000 copies on DVD, launching the church into the national spotlight. The church leaders lit upon the idea of troubled relationships. ""Families and marriages are crumbing and we want to do something about it,"" said Kendrick, recalling the idea's genesis. ""God give us the idea. We had no clue what would happen with it."" ""Fireproof"" began with a $500,000 budget and a fresh crop of church member/actors, but the film got a left-field boost when Cameron, best known as the 1980s heartthrob from the TV series ""Growing Pains,"" read the script and asked to get involved. ""All throughout the movie ... there are issues of communications, money, sex, addiction, porn, extramarital affairs, feeling respected at work but not at home, feeling respected by friends but not at home,"" Cameron told CNN. The themes resonated with the actor and devout Christian, a husband of 17 years, and father of six, he said. That and the ""cool action scenes,"" he added. The makers of ""Fireproof"" tapped into the church market, arranging screenings for the National Baptist Pastors' convention before release and using word-of-mouth among church leaders. However, says Cameron, the film was pitched to general audiences, not necessarily Christians. ""'Fireproof' was never marketed as a Christian movie. This is a movie about marriage,"" Cameron said. ""The fact is, though, the gospel is presented, is done well, and it's a central part of the storyline."" Although many critics panned ""Fireproof"" -- ""as sincere, uncynical and subtlety-free as a Sunday school lecture,"" said Variety -- audiences embraced it. ""There's a huge market out there that's underserved. That market is there and a lot of people don't want to go there but there is a huge untapped market,"" Cameron said. Paul Dergarabedian, a box office analyst for Hollywood.com, said he was shocked when the movie debuted in the top five its opening weekend. ""With 'Fireproof,' they really cracked the code with the major success with the film and have this appeal across the board,"" he said. ""They didn't follow traditional marketing methods but they didn't need them for this film. ... Maybe that's why it worked out so well."" He added, ""You're talking about a very successful property. ... The powers that be that put this together are really on to something."" Churches are using ""Love Dare"" and its companion curriculum as a teaching tool, says publisher B&H Publishing's Andrea Dennis, who calls ""Fireproof"" ""a marriage movement."" For Valentine's Day more than 9,000 churches are scheduled to show the film, many displaying the admonition ""Fireproof Your Marriage"" on their signs. B&H believes ""Love Dare"" could hang around on the best-seller list -- where it's already been for 19 weeks -- along the lines of Rick Warren's ""The Purpose Driven Life."" And the filmmakers have kept their success close to home. Alex Kendrick said the church used the profits from the movie to buy 82 acres of land and build a recreation center for the town, equipped with eight tennis courts, eight basketball courts and an equestrian area. A baseball diamond is on the way. He's confident ""Fireproof"" will remain a successful brand. ""When something grows the only reason it happens is people say it worked and you should try it,"" Kendrick said. ""When it works and there's a legitimate impact, people want to be a part of it.""",0.6226926,2423
136,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Social networking, Martin Scorsese and cinema classics on demand: this is the enticing mix on offer at new movie Web site The Auteurs. The Auteurs mastermind Efe Cakarel (center) at Cannes with Celluloid Dreams' Hengameh Panahi (left) and Martin Scorsese. The self-styled ""online cinematheque"" allows users to watch art house films from directors like Michael Winterbottom, Francois Ozon and Walter Salles, while Facebook-style profile pages and discussion forums encourage movie debate. With their innovative approach, The Auteurs hope to introduce art house cinema to a whole new audience. Recently, The Auteurs announced a prestigious partnership with another more widely known auteur: Scorsese. The site is collaborating with Scorsese's World Cinema Foundation (WCF) -- an organization dedicated to restoring lost cinema classics from around the world -- to exhibit the refurbished masterpieces online. The first four rescued works from Scorsese's project are currently available to watch for free on The Auteurs Web site. Among them are Korean domestic thriller ""The Housemaid"" (1960) and ""Transes"" (1973), a documentary about pioneering Moroccan band Nass El Ghiwan, famously described by Scorsese as ""the Rolling Stones of North Africa."" Watch a clip from ""The Housemaid"" Watch a clip from ""Transes"" ""It is really exciting and important to have Scorsese preserving the films he is preserving,"" said one of the masterminds behind The Auteurs, Eduardo Costantini, over the phone from New York. ""As he said, it's not only important to preserve, but to show -- and he chose The Auteurs because of our look and feel and our philosophy and concept. We are really proud."" The basic ambition behind The Auteurs is to make high quality cinema accessible to a young, global audience by making it available on demand cheaply. ""If you are not in LA, London, New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, Paris, or Berlin, forget it,"" Efe Cakarel told CNN over the phone from Palo Alto, California. ""Many of these films you cannot get even on DVD if you are living in Warsaw, in Istanbul, in Seoul or Buenos Aires."" The Auteurs is Cakarel's brainchild: an ambitious former Goldman Sachs banker with a head for technology, he came up with the idea back in 2007 in Tokyo when, with some spare time on his hands, he tried to watch Wong Kar-wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" on the Internet. ""It was very simple. I went online and I did not find a place that I could use,"" he says. He started writing his business plan there and then. Cakarel says he knew that if he was going to succeed in his quest to bring quality cinema to the global village he would have to enlist some of the industry's top brass. Enter Argentine millionaire, Eduardo Costantini of Costa Films, the company behind 2007 Berlinale winner ""Elite Troop,"" and Hengameh Panahi of Paris-based distributor Celluloid Dreams which represents films like Jacques Audiard's ""A Prophet,"" which won the Grand Prize at Cannes Film Festival this year. Costantini and Panahi have instilled the site with their film knowledge, and paved the way for the site's other major collaboration with masters of the vintage re-release, the Criterion Collection. Each month, the Criterion Collection curates a free online film festival making available classic films from its large library on The Auteurs. This month, users can watch Michelangelo Antonioni's 1960 classic ""L'Avventura"" or ""Harakiri"" (1962) by Japanese master Masaki Kobayashi. Of course, all this begs the question: is there really a big appetite for auteur-driven feature films outside the lofty but limited cinephile circles -- especially at a time when studio-driven blockbuster fodder like ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and ""Angels & Demons"" dominate at the box office? ""I want to create an entirely new audience for these films,"" says Cakarel. ""Because the only thing people in much of the world are exposed to is ""Spiderman 3"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in their local multiplex."" The Auteurs is one of a number of Web sites, like jaman.com, making previously hard-to-find films available on the Internet since the YouTube revolution paved the way for new ways of consuming video on the Web. The Auteurs' particular niche is auteur-driven cinema combined with social networking: ""Putting the films online is only part of it. The moment you put the film in the existing conversation between people that know each other, then you create a platform for discovery. According to Cakarel, what sets the site apart from the others is quality: each film is individually encoded (compared to most sites, which batch encode films) for the Web which he says gives a higher quality of sound and vision than anywhere else on the Web. ""Being the best in the world has a huge premium and I know that we can be the best in the world,"" said Cakarel. The site is cleanly designed, easy to navigate and you can pay to watch films like 1998 Dogme 95 classic ""Festen"" by Danish director Thomas Vinterberg and ""The Corporation,"" (2003) an unsettling examination of the pre-eminence of big business. Currently there are 200 films available to watch, some free, but mostly for around $5. Costantini says he hopes to increase the number of films to 1,000. Despite the unabashedly highbrow aims of the site, both Cakarel and Costantini realize they will need to include more commercial fare if they want to increase membership of the site which currently stands at around 80,000. ""It is important we start getting some major films,"" said Costantini. ""Not only treasures that Scorsese restores but also some films that are more commercial."" Cakarel says he would love to host quality studio films like the Coen's ""No Country for Old Men,"" Oscar-winner ""There Will be Blood,"" and Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds."" But there are limits: ""I will never put a mainstream film that is purely for entertainment; that has no soul on the site. ""You will never see 'Knocked Up' or 'Spiderman 3.'""",0.62263876,9594
137,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- In its opening weekend, ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" scared and thrilled millions of moviegoers across the country. In ""The Haunting in Connecticut,"" Virginia Madsen sees strange things happen in her old house. The film, which earned $23 million to finish No. 2 at the box office, emphasizes psychological horror over slasher film blood 'n' gore, which its audience apparently appreciated. But Virginia Madsen, who plays Sara Campbell in the film, confessed that, while filming, fear was not just reserved for the screen. ""We all stayed in this big, old hotel which was kind of like the one in 'The Shining,' one of those turn-of-the- century big, old hotels,"" Madsen told CNN. ""I had a little chat with my room. I said, 'Just out of respect, if there are any entities around, I need to stay here, I have a lot of work to do, I have to sleep at night, so please leave me alone.' "" Yet, Madsen admitted, her belief in ghosts is not very strong. ""I do have an attraction to paranormal investigation and all those kinds of shows but I'm not sure if I really believe in ghosts,"" she said. ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" is based on the true story of Sara Campbell, a mother who moves her family into an old house in Connecticut in order to be closer to the hospital where her son, Matt (Kyle Gallner), receives cancer treatment. The house was once a funeral home and, shortly after their move, the family begins witnessing strange, supernatural activities. ""Something very powerful and very real happened to this family. Whether or not you believe it was some sort of demon or, you know, they're manifesting it -- whatever it is -- it changed their lives,"" Madsen said. Madsen, 47, is probably best known for her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Sideways"" as Maya Randall, the restaurant waitress who gets involved in a romance with the prickly writer played by Paul Giamatti. Since that 2004 film, the actress has made several films, including ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""The Number 23."" She and the rest of the cast developed a close relationship on the set and were much like a family behind the scenes. ""I was more like a mother bear with my young actors,"" Madsen said. In fact, Madsen added, her close relationship with the younger actors made filming difficult at times. ""One scene in the movie that was the hardest for me to do was when [Matt] wakes up ... and his skin is all carved with these different incantations,"" she said. ""And I open his shirt and he's just looking up at me with these big blue eyes with tears ... and he really felt like my boy, he really felt like my second son."" Madsen said the film, complete with ghosts, séances and creaking floorboards, is successful because it has all the elements of a good horror flick. ""The movie works ... because it plays on our most basic childhood fears. 'Something's under the bed, something's in the closet, something's in the mirror.' And all of us still have those same childhood terrors,"" she said. The desire to experience those same terrors and to forget about everyday life, Madsen added, draws people to the theaters at an older age. ""I like things that go bump in the night, and scary things that are fun,"" she said. ""That's really what this movie really is. I think horror movies are so popular because times are especially hard and I think a horror movie more than any other kind of movie is a true escape ... You're forgetting about your life because you're like, 'Oh my God!' "" CNN's Elham Khatami contributed to this story.",0.62241733,4452
138,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- While the Oscars is without doubt the grandest of all the awards ceremonies, it doesn't have the world stage to itself. ""Persepolis"" won the French nomination -- but failed to make the Academy's shortlist . In London, the Brits have their BAFTAs; Spain has the Goyas; and France celebrates the Cesars, where ""La Vie En Rose"" won six out of its ""magnifique"" 11 nominations. And it was this foreign fare that gave rise to the biggest controversy at Hollywood's big event. ""La Vie En Rose"" amassed an impressive eleven nominations at the French Cesar Awards. Marion Cotillard's astonishing transformation into Edith Piaf won her Best Actress gongs at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and the Academy Awards. But ""La Vie En Rose"" was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film. Another French language film, ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" was on many critics' top ten lists for the films of 2007. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and its American director Julian Schnabel was nominated for an Oscar. But like ""La Vie En Rose,"" this film was not among the contenders for Best Foreign Film. A third French film, ""Persepolis"" won the special jury prize at Cannes and it received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but yet again, this was not a nominee for Best Foreign Film. France suffered through an abundance of riches this year, with three potential Oscar winners. But to enter the race for Best Foreign film, France, like every other country, had to nominate just one. So ""La Vie En Rose"" and ""Diving Bell"" were rejected by the French film authorities in favor of ""Persepolis."" But ""Persepolis"" didn't sufficiently impress the Oscar judges: so France had no films among the final five nominees. French frustration at the Oscar process was echoed in Taiwan, which chose Ang Lee's film, ""Lust Caution,"" as its official entry. The film won both critical acclaim and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. But Oscar judges ruled there was too little Taiwanese involvement -- none of the lead actors are from Taiwan. The double Oscar winning director watched in disbelief as his film was banned and Taiwan was told to pick another film instead: Oscar caution triumphing over Ang Lee's lust for a third Academy Award. And the list goes on: the Israeli film, ""The Band's Visit"" was excluded for having too much English -- but it's the only way the Israeli and Egyptian protagonists can communicate in the film and is a key part of the plot. But Israel submitted ""Beaufort"" instead -- and made the final five. ""The Kite Runner"" may have proved an international success at the box office, but it didn't fly with Oscar watchdogs. Set in Afghanistan with Farsi as its main language, it fell foul of the rulebook by having too little Afghan involvement and a Swiss-American director. But for most critics, the most inexplicable omission from the shortlist of nominees was Romania's ""4 Months, 3 weeks & 2 Days,"" winner of the Palme D'Or in Cannes and considered by many to be a sure-fire Oscar winner. Some feel its challenging subject of a back-street abortion in communist Romania was too testing for conservative members of the Academy's Foreign Film Committee, whose volunteers tend to include many retirees -- who else has time to attend screenings of 63 foreign language films? Even Marc Johnson, the Chairman of the Academy's Foreign Language Film Committee, acknowledged that some of the criticism levelled against the Academy this year was ""justifiable"". He told CNN: ""We took quite a beating, and I think quite justifiably, not for the films that we selected but for the films that we DIDN'T select. ""And I felt very passionately about it and spoke out about it more than I should have done, but there was a part of me saying ""wait a minute I didn't sign on for this -- I didn't sign on to be the scapegoat and we received a lot of criticism and yet it's something I feel so passionately about I think foreign language film and particularly subtitled film in the U.S. are really an endangered species."" Defenders of the Academy also point out that they're only asking countries to nominate their favorite film; they then pick the best of that bunch. Mr Johnson said it would be unfair to allow countries to submit more than one film as the selection process would become ""unmanageable"". ""There have been arguments that why can't a coutnry submit more films? France for instance might argue we make 50 films a year, maybe five of them are Oscar worthy and Ecuador maybe only makes one why is it we have the same group as they?"" . ""Not that I ever like to mix sports with the arts but it's a little bit like the World Cup. Brazil could probably submit five teams but they're only allowed to submit one -- and it's what makes it a fair race,"" he explains. ""The other thing is quite frankly this year we had 63 films. We could not see many more than that. So if we had 5 from this country and 3 from this country it would be completely unmanageable."" And while the one-film-per-country rule fails to reward a nation with a flourishing film industry, it does ensure diversity: no less than 63 countries from Azerbaijan to Vietnam submitted films for the 80th Academy Awards. Israel, Austria, Poland, Russia, and Kazakhstan -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on Oscar night, and the Academy points to the quality of those on the list, rather those that are not, as ultimate proof that the system works.

139,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A man walks around the side of a building, footsteps falling in time to the heartbeat of a driving pop soundtrack, pulls out a pistol and guns down another man. Tony Servillo as arch-manipulator and seven time Italian Prime Minister, Guilio Andreotti, in Paolo Sorrentino's ""Il Divo."" A montage of grisly murders follows, all with the same infectious pop song pounding in the background. It's edge-of-the-seat stuff and it's only the opening sequence of gifted Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's biopic of Italian politician Giulio Andreotti, ""Il Divo."" Sorrentino's film chronicles the career of probably the most important and controversial politico in Italy's recent history. But, more than that, it pins Andreotti to the specimen board and dissects his character without mercy. The film caught the eye of the judges at Cannes Film Festival last year where it picked up the Jury Prize. Predictably, Andreotti didn't react well to the film. ""He was very angry,"" recalls Sorrentino. Now 91 years-old, Andreotti has been Prime Minister of Italy seven times. His Christian Democrat Party was the leading force in Italian politics as a one-party system for four decades. The rules of the game were shattered in the early 1990s by ""Tangentopoli""  or Bribesville -- a corruption scandal that laid bare some of the government's unsavory practices, ruining careers and resulting in the suicides of some leading politicians. Andreotti himself was implicated in illegal activities, including connections to the Mafia, but was finally acquitted of all charges. Today, he is a senator for life. Something of the man's influence in all spheres of Italian public life becomes clear when Sorrentino -- who says he is not a political director, ""only in this case"" -- explains how hard he found it to fund the film. ""In Italy nobody wanted to finance the film because everybody was scared,"" Sorrentino told CNN. ""He has been a very powerful man for many years."" Sorrentino managed eventually to secure funding from a private source. ""It is not easy for Italian companies to put money in this project, so we did it with the private money of very courageous individuals,"" he said. Sorrentino picks up the Andreotti story at the beginning of the 1990s, just prior to his implication in the scandal, as he is about to assume power for the seventh time. A good deal of ""Il Divo's"" success lies in a stunning portrayal of Andreotti by Naples-born actor Toni Servillo, who is a veteran of three of Sorrentino's other films including 2006's ""The Consequences of Love."" Servillo's Andreotti is a stiff, impassive tortoise of a man. With a hunched back, skinny sloping shoulders and strange drooping ears, Andreotti appears physically frail. He is beset by headaches -- indeed, the opening scene of the film shows him with a head full of acupuncture needles trying to get rid of one -- a taste of the mix of drama and humor that informs the rest of the film. But where the body is weak the will is strong and in Andreotti's wit and cunning intelligence -- ""I know I'm an average man, but looking around I don't see any giants"" -- there is a sense of a man who can and will do anything to stay in power. ""I have always wanted to make a film about Andreotti,"" says Sorrentino. ""He is so psychologically complex that everyone has been intrigued by him over the years. ""It's a political film but at the same time a film about a complex character from a psychological point of view."" For a long time, though, Sorrentino was convinced that the vast amounts of literature written about the man could never be distilled into a structure that would work on film -- ""It made my head spin,"" he remembers. While Sorrentino almost had too much material to mine while researching Andreotti's public life, it was impossible to get access to details of his home life. Sorrentino had to go on instinct and imagine life behind the scenes for the great man. Something that made aspects of Andreotti's response to the film very puzzling. ""He told everything was false, a lie, about his public life and at the same time he said the film was very precise about his private life,"" recalls Sorrentino. ""But all the public things in the film are documented. It's on record that the events took place. ""The trials, the letters, the diary of Aldo Moro, the Prime Minister who was kidnapped by the Red Brigade and held in captivity for 55 days. (Andreotti was Prime Minister at the time and decided not to negotiate with the terrorists and they killed him.) ""And about the private life I invented everything."" One of the most surprising things about the 39-year-old director's film is the soundtrack. Full of rock, pop, electronica -- ""Nux Vomica"" by The Veils an indie band from New Zealand and ""Toop Toop"" by French electro artists Cassius -- mixed in with classical music like Vivaldi and Sibelius. It's incongruous but it delivers a hefty emotional punch. ""The idea was to make a rock opera about a man very far from rock,"" says Sorrentino. ""I didn't want to do a traditional biopic.""",0.6214872,2028
140,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- It's been five years since Carrie Bradshaw journeyed to Paris in search of true love on the series finale of ""Sex and the City."" She appeared to have found it in the arms of Mr. Big, and she returned to New York -- and her now-settled friends -- ready for a new start. Sarah Jessica Parker was a driving force in creating the ""Sex and the City"" movie. Then came the inevitable cry: That's it? What happens next? Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, wanted to find out as well. But the situation had to be right, she said, which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together, fell apart and came together again. Now that the movie is out, Parker -- who's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big-screen ""Sex and the City"" with ""Showbiz Tonight"" anchor A.J. Hammer. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: I think a lot of fans, maybe a lot of people, and those of you among the cast, didn't think this day would actually ever come ... but here we are. So how are you feeling deep inside, Sarah? Sarah Jessica Parker: I feel extraordinarily privileged. I've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together. ... It's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of professional experience and one really shouldn't be greedy enough to ask for it twice.  Watch the cast talk about the thrill of ""Sex"" » . I have to say that, this last six, eight months, was better than those seven years [the show aired] and I think it's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you don't get to tell twice. It has been, I must say, worth every obstacle and dead end, and fit and start, and every moment that was seemingly impossible. It has been a dream. CNN: And I imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read, which was, from my understanding, the first time you all actually were in the same room [together] regardless of how much you kept in touch. Tell me a little bit about that moment. Parker: I started putting [the] script back together in April of 2006 ... and that [table read] was a really extraordinary day, because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated. Kim [Cattrall] had been away and Kristin [Davis] had been away and Chris [Noth] had been [doing] his other job, and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more. It was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours. ... It was a kind of reunion that is very, very special, because you really want to be there. It's not the reunion where you're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely. It's the reunion that you want. I think even more so was that first day on [the] set. When we thought, good God, [writer/director] Michael Patrick [King] and I are actually making this movie, like we got it done, we're here, we're doing it -- what a privilege. CNN: I think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on ""Oprah,"" because the energy was ... palpable. ... But we're talking about the perceived drama around this whole project. (Rumors have abounded about friction between the stars.) One of my producers said while we were watching the TV, ""Are they going to sit near each other?"" ""Why are they putting Chris in the middle of all of them?"" Hearing that, does it make you mad? Parker: I find it slightly -- it's not that I'm mad. I expect better from people. I think it's really beneath me, to keep defending myself. I have a 35-year career. I have an impeccable character, I really pride myself in my work ethic and the way I treat people. And I think Kim would say the same and Cynthia would say the same. And I love Kim, and I wanted her to be in this movie. We couldn't have done it without her, we couldn't have done it without Kristin, we couldn't have done it without Cynthia [Nixon], nor could we have done it without Chris.  Watch Cattrall address the rumors » . You know, this is a story that people like to tell about women. Why? I don't know. Is it that interesting? Probably not. So once again I just have to say it doesn't define the experience. Nobody can take the experience away. It's far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale. CNN: You seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to, being at the game as long as you've been. To that end, one of the things that I've always admired about you and [husband] Matthew [Broderick] and I think a lot of people do, is how you've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight. ... Now I know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you don't talk about your private lives, which is great and I applaud that. That said, is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that? Parker: I wouldn't make any proclamations about why I have a marriage that, to me, is successful. I would just say that we've chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people. This is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia, and the movie industry fits into it in some small way, but there are a lot of people of important interest and I think that it's a conscious choice to live in a place where we're bumping up against humanity. We run to the market on our own, we take the subway, and we integrate into our city, and we become a part of the fabric and I think it's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son. Does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we don't have paparazzi every single day at our house? No, but it is a city where you can't live behind a gate, you can't drive up in a car and be protected. You walk out the door and it is what it is. So you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can. CNN: Is it the end of ""Sex and the City""? What does your gut tell you? Parker: My gut tells me it's up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up. The future is dictated not by us at this point, and I think Michael Patrick and I have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen, that we haven't thought about the future. Doing this was more than we could have asked for. So anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way.",0.6214682,1220
142,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Let those other filmmakers focus on world destruction or masked superheroes or beautiful people doing beautiful things. Jason Bateman plays the owner of an extract factory in ""Extract,"" Mike Judge's latest. Mike Judge prefers to deal with real life. Judge, writer and director of ""Office Space"" and co-creator of the TV series ""King of the Hill,"" has long liked to set his work in the world of malfunctioning copiers and beer-drinking propane salesmen. Even his wicked satire of the future, ""Idiocracy,"" focused on the inanities of everyday life, just set 500 years from now. His new film, ""Extract,"" is no exception: It's about a factory owner, Joel (Jason Bateman), who must deal with a host of employee problems as well as a chilly wife. Of course, Joel's solutions aren't exactly the stuff of Solomon, but such is the way of comedy. Bateman understands Judge's motivations. ""He likes to keep everything very middle-of-the-road common people, small town, small problems, relatable, blue-collar,"" said the actor, who called Judge ""a ninja of comedy."" ""And those people, they run extract factories; they make drywall. I mean, it's the stuff that we all need often goes unnoticed; he likes to write about those people, and I'm glad he does."" ""Extract,"" which also stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Wiig, J.K. Simmons and a long-haired and heavily bearded Ben Affleck, opens Friday. Judge talked to CNN about his subject matter and his cast. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Where did this idea come from? I'd read that you worked in a factory before. Mike Judge: Yeah, it kind of came from all over the place. I've worked many jobs, and I did work in a factory a couple times -- a place that made guitar amps, and then I worked in a place in Albuquerque [New Mexico], where I grew up, that stuffed those snack boxes with Fritos and candy bars and stuff. CNN: Casting for the film, how did that come together? Did you have a set idea in your head? Judge: When I first wrote the first draft, I wasn't thinking about anybody in particular and, then I saw ""Arrested Development"" years later. I['d] put the script on the shelf and thought Jason Bateman would be perfect, so I did a rewrite thinking about him but no one in particular for the other characters. I just wrote it and then just did kind of the normal casting process. But then, we were reading people for the character of [Joel's friend] Dean, and my casting director comes in one day and said, ""Ben Affleck is interesting."" And I thought, ""Really, I've never met the guy."" And I [also] thought, ""Yeah, but he's like strapping, handsome leading-man guy."" Then I started thinking about it, and I love him when he's a character actor like in ""Dazed and Confused"" or ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and then I met him, and he just got it. He had this take on him based on a guy he went to high school with. We did a read-through the script, and him and Jason just killing me, I just thought it was just really funny. You know, he was willing to get out of his leading man look and grow a beard. It was really fun. CNN: It was fun to see him do that. It was a different dynamic. Judge: Yeah. I think Ben, actually, I think he enjoyed being this character. I think he hasn't gotten to do something like that in a while. In fact, we had a big break [during shooting]. ... And he has one scene in the factory, so he had like maybe two or three weeks between the bulk of it and that last scene in it. I got the sense he was really happy to come back and put on his ""Dean"" get-up and get back into that character. He was just really fun. CNN: And Joel, he's a nice guy who just wants to have sex with his wife. It seems pretty simple. Judge: Yeah, and I think he, you know, he, he wants kind of simple things, and he's worked so hard. It's maybe be a little bit of a mid-life crisis he's going through, I think. And he just sort of tests the waters, dips his toe in, doing something a little crazy, and then just everything goes to hell for him. CNN: We saw this with ""Office Space,"" too, making the workplace funny. What's that process like? Judge: Well, to me, I think there's a lot of interesting characters [at work], and just the dynamics of a workplace are really ... funny to me. I've had a lot of jobs, and I think there's a lot of material there and, I just remember thinking, growing up in the '80s, thinking like everyone on TV shows and movies, these characters seem to have like endless cash. You never see, [when you] become an adult and even as a teenager, it's like, ""OK, I gotta pay my car insurance, and I gotta do this and that."" And then you get a job, and it's like, you're there all day. ... I don't know, I think if your soul doesn't get stomped out of you, you can still see the comedy in all of it. So I'd wanted to do something that's set in more a blue-collar place like a factory, and it's told from the point of view of the guy who owns it and sympathetic to him instead of the employee angry at the bosses. CNN: Why extract? Are you an extract expert? Judge: (laughs) Well, there was a couple of reasons. There was a book lying around my freshman year in the college dorms that was about food flavoring, and I actually just thought it was kind of interesting. Then years later, south of Austin [Texas], there used to be this really great building; it was the Adams Extract Factory. ... My Realtor one day, we were looking at a house, and he points to a really nice house in this neighborhood, and he says, ""That's where the Adams Extract people live."" It's just this odd item that's in every grocery store in the country, but you don't think about it much, and when I'd say that that's what it's about, people start laughing. So I figured I'm one step ahead of it there.",0.62027633,8654
143,"Editor's note: CNN writer Alan Duke has had two small voice-only roles in Tyler Perry's TV series, ""House of Payne,"" which airs on CNN's sister network TBS. He has had no relationship with Perry beyond observing him on set. Tyler Perry stars in ""Madea Goes to Jail,"" which is due out Friday. Perry is trying to expand his reach to Europe. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Tyler Perry wants to take his character Madea to Europe, but he's been told that audiences there won't relate to his stories about African-American lives.  The films have made nearly $300 million at U.S. box offices. The challenge to conquer Europe has ""sat in my spirit,"" Perry wrote in a newsletter to his fans. Perry, who just a few years ago was homeless and broke, has made a fortune proving naysayers and critics wrong with a successful string of low-budget movies based on his Christian-themed stage plays. ""I was once told [by] someone that my movies only appeal to black people and no one else,"" Perry wrote. ""Now, I know that's not true."" When his first movie -- ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" -- debuted in 2005, people who had seen his stage plays in person or on DVD flocked to theaters, making it the week's top movie with almost $22 million in ticket sales. Critics, who consistently pan Perry's productions, were confounded. ""They think I don't know what I am doing,"" he said in a CNN interview. ""They think that this is all haphazard, that I am some sort of idiot or something.""  Watch Perry sound off on ""Madea"" and other topics » . Perry said he does not write to please the critics, but for a broad audience of all ages. With six films already out and a seventh -- ""Madea Goes To Jail"" -- coming soon, Perry has never made a box office flop. His movies average nearly $22 million on opening weekends and almost $47 million in total domestic sales. ""Tyler Perry has a definite and growing fan base in this country and it's simply a matter of, can he create and grow a fan base in other countries,"" said independent producer Alex Franklin. Franklin -- a former development executive at Lionsgate, the film company that distributes Perry's films in the United States -- was the first person at that studio to read his script for ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman."" He agrees that Perry's movies should sell in Europe, but he said there is a tendency by distributors there to avoid films about African-Americans and films without major American stars who are well-known in Europe. While Perry's casts have included Angela Bassett, Janet Jackson and Kathy Bates, many of his characters, including Madea, come from his stage plays, which are known only to a mostly black American audience. But David Mann -- who is ""Mr. Brown"" in Perry's productions -- said he has seen the audience broaden since the early years of the stage plays. ""I can recall when we first started, I would say 90 to 95 percent of the audience would be African-American,"" Mann said. ""But now, you look out there and it's like, 'Wow! It's just a rainbow.' "" Perry, in his message to fans, said he sees his stories as universal. ""I know that even though I write from an African-American experience and most of the time I have an all-African-American cast, that doesn't mean that other people from other walks of life can't relate,"" he said. ""I think that any human being who goes through what we all go through can relate to my films. ""I know and remember that when I'm writing,"" he continued. ""But when this person said that to me, they also said Europeans would never relate, and that sat in my spirit."" Perry said he flew to Europe in January -- ""to find out for myself"" -- with visits to Rome, Madrid and London. It was there that he wrote his letter to his American fans. ""So far, all of us seem to be pretty much the same,"" he said. ""We love to laugh, we all have problems, we all want love, and we all have a church in every country. And since these are the things I usually write about, I don't see how that statement can be true. Do you?"" Perry could get his answer soon. Lionsgate has not said if ""Madea Goes To Jail,"" which debuts Friday, will be marketed to European audiences.

144,"Editor's note: Bryan Batt, who plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano in the Emmy award-winning cable TV series ""Mad Men,"" has acted in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions, such as ""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Jeffrey"" and ""Starlight Express."" Batt, who is 45, has been acting for 23 years. He spoke to CNN.com about being an openly gay actor. ""We have to work toward acceptance on all levels,"" says actor Bryan Batt, who is openly gay. (CNN) -- There was once a time when the revelation of one's homosexuality in Hollywood was thought to be a career-killer. Now, out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine. There are also more gay characters on prime-time television shows than ever before. But even with greater acceptance by the mainstream public, is coming out still a big deal? To shed light on the issue, CNN recently spoke to Bryan Batt, 45, about his experience as an openly gay actor in Hollywood. CNN: Has being openly gay affected your career? Batt: I came from the stage; much of my experience has been on the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage. Being gay never really posed a problem. In the Broadway community, it's always been a little more accepted. There's something different with film acting and TV acting. You're in someone's home -- it's more intimate. When I look at someone, I really don't care about whom they're sleeping with or what they're doing. I'm thinking they either have talent or no talent. But people are really obsessed with wanting to know about the ins and outs of people's private lives. It's still like high school.  Batt plays both straight, gay roles » . CNN: When did you come out? Batt: My real Broadway break was in ""Starlight Express."" At that time, I was toying with [coming out]. It's harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be. I've heard of people doing it in Hollywood. It's a very sad and difficult choice. I think it's a personal journey, and I think people on their own time will figure it out. Clay Aiken is still really very, very young; he has to deal with his own issues. Thank God, when it was my time, no one was pushing me; no one was trying to force me. It was on my own terms intimately with my mother and brother. It went wonderfully. My mother said, ""No matter what, you're my son. I'm going to love you."" Not one of my family or friends turned their back on me. I was fortunate, but it was still a very difficult thing to do, and I was fearful. Afterwards, it was like the heaviest weight was taken off my back; all those years worrying for nothing. But not everyone is as lucky; some people are shunned and kicked out of their homes and families, which is criminal. Just this year, I was asked to host a fundraiser for The Point Foundation, a wonderful group that provides full college scholarships to gay and lesbian students of merit who have suffered such treatment by their families and cannot afford tuition and the necessary funds for higher education -- an inspiring organization. I only told my mother and my brother after I was cast in ""Jeffrey,"" a play by Paul Rudnick that was the first AIDS comedy. I said to myself, if I get this, I've just got to sit down and talk with my family. My partner and I have been together 19 years, and that was the same time he told his parents. A good parent knows; they love and accept. What most good parents want for their children is for their child to be happy and healthy and be good contributing members of society. CNN: Are there barriers to what openly gay actors can do today? Batt: It's just like any prejudice, once you let go of any prejudice they all have to go. They're not based on facts, just on stereotypes. I really think yes, there might be some homophobia in Hollywood, but it's based on what will sell. Hollywood is a huge industry, a multibillion-dollar business. If actors who are gay will get ratings and will sell, they will get cast. There are always going to be people who look at people who are different and who disapprove [of them] either through fear or through ignorance. We have to work toward acceptance on all levels. How long ago were the civil rights movement and the women's movement? And, still today, women don't make the same amount of money as men do for doing the same job. CNN: What's your view of the character you play, Salvatore Romano, in ""Mad Men""? Batt: The character basically is clearly gay to a 2007 audience, but no one in the world of 1960 is suspicious whatsoever. What a great role to play. This season, I'm married. I get stopped all the time on the street, and I get asked, ""When is your character coming out?"" What is he coming out to in 1962? I asked to get married this season. I thanked [series creator] Matthew Weiner, and he said, ""You asked."" It provides another wonderful level to the character. That is what happened then and unfortunately still happens today. [In a recent episode, the ""Gold Violin,""] the scene with my wife, it was just so poignant and painful, someone said to me that what she loved about the episode was that we clearly did love each other. We were like the gold violin, we were beautiful but we just didn't make music . CNN: What would you like to see Hollywood do? Batt: Continue to reward good work and put positive role models out there. The one thing about ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- it was a beautifully filmed and acted film depicting a tortured relationship. The reason I thought the movie was so great is people walked away thinking, ""Why couldn't they just be together?"" The more positive or interesting the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters, the better. They should show people who are living their good, healthy, responsible, productive lives as role models who just happen to be gay. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the subject.",0.6182923,1026
146,"(CNN) -- It used to be called ""the love that dare not speak its name"" -- particularly in Hollywood, where the revelation of homosexuality was believed to be a career-killer. Clay Aiken recently announced he was gay on the cover of People magazine. Now, out gays and lesbians are as casually visible as the cover of People magazine, which has recently run stories on Ellen DeGeneres' wedding to Portia de Rossi and Clay Aiken's decision to discuss his sexuality. So, in a time when self-declared bisexual Tila Tequila can have a highly rated MTV show on looking for a partner of either sex, Lindsay Lohan talks about her relationship with DJ Samantha Ronson and ""Star Trek's"" George Takei can have a very public wedding with his longtime partner, is coming out still a big deal? Publicist Howard Bragman, author of the forthcoming ""Where's My Fifteen Minutes"" (Portfolio), says that it is. ""Every person that comes out is another barrier coming down,"" Bragman, who is openly gay, told CNN.com. Acceptance by the mainstream public, he observes, is easier but by no means automatic, particularly when issues such as gay marriage are at stake. ""I look at it as a long-term process. The revolution is over -- now it's an evolution.""  Watch ""American Morning's"" Lola Ogunnaike look at changing attitudes » . Bragman was around when a performer revealing his or her homosexuality could still shock. He helped guide Dick Sargent when the ""Bewitched"" star came out of the closet in 1989, and remembers when it was difficult to get support for movies such as ""Philadelphia,"" the 1993 film that won Tom Hanks an Oscar as a lawyer dying of AIDS. Now, he observes, there are gay actors -- ""How I Met My Mother's"" Neil Patrick Harris may be the most notable -- playing straight roles, something that would have been almost unthinkable even a few years ago, since studios have often been nervous casting known gay performers in straight roles. "" 'We'll buy Hanks as a gay man but not the opposite,' "" Bragman describes the industry thinking. Indeed, there are now more gay characters in prime-time television than ever. Shows such as ""Ugly Betty,"" ""The Office"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" feature gay or bisexual characters, and this fall, five more will hit the airwaves, bringing the total to 16, according to a study by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). ""It's certainly positive that there is such a dramatic increase,"" GLAAD's president, Neil Giuliano, told CNN. ""Number one, it reflects society, and the fact that we are more visible, and it also makes good television. Portrayals are almost more honest and real."" Peter Sprigg, vice president of policy for the conservative Family Research Council, doesn't agree. ""I'm convinced that for the most part, these characters are placed on television for propaganda purposes, in order to persuade people to be more accepting of homosexual conduct,"" he told CNN. ""In that sense, the result for society is likely to be negative."" But Bryan Batt, the gay actor who plays the closeted Salvatore Romano on the Emmy-winning ""Mad Men,"" says that viewers are more accepting of gay characters today, though concerns linger. ""Yes, I did think maybe this going to hurt me career-wise [to come out], but I come from Broadway and a lot of theater background. So, you know, no one really cares ... you don't have to be straight to act straight. You don't have to be gay to play gay,"" he told CNN.  Watch Batt talk about the challenges of a gay actor » . But, he adds, ""There is, I think, a little bit of homophobia. I do believe that through education and seeing good, honest, positive gay role models, it will just educate. I think we are producing generations now of youth that do not judge people; they don't judge people on their race or their religion or their sexuality."" April Woodard, a correspondent for ""Inside Edition,"" told CNN Headline News' ""Showbiz Tonight"" that rejection may have been on Aiken's mind. The singer, a born-again Christian, had long declined to talk about his sexuality, and with a strong Middle American fan base, may have been afraid of a backlash. ""There are definitely going to be some people in the South where he lives that aren't going to agree with it, and some of the Christians are not going to agree with his lifestyle and even having a child out of wedlock,"" she said. For his part, Aiken -- who recently became the father to a newborn son -- told People that coming out ""was the first decision I made as a father. I cannot raise a child to lie or hide things. ... I've never intended to lie to anybody at all. The fans, if they leave, they leave. But if they leave, I don't want them hating me."" Bragman believes Aiken will be more successful than ever. ""I'm sure, anecdotally, you'll have people not buying the next Aiken album because he's gay, but it will be statistically insignificant. If you're a fan, you're a fan,"" he said. Aiken and other gay celebrities have generally received support from their colleagues and the public. ""Heroes"" star Kristen Bell, who is straight, told CNN that ""[Aiken] shouldn't really have to acknowledge it."" ""What surprises and saddens me is that it still is big news,"" she said. But Bragman observes that the decision to come out remains intensely personal. ""It's not a career move -- it's a personal move,"" he said. ""[It's saying,] 'I need to do this for me.' "" There are still many performers and industry notables, he says, who threaten to sue if their sexuality is revealed. Others live gay social lives but don't talk about their sexuality -- the so-called ""glass closet."" And, as Bragman notes, gay stars are generally from the second tier: ""There are still no A-list movie stars out of the closet, there are still no superstar athletes,"" he said. ""It's great to see how far we've come,"" he said. ""[And] we all long for the day when it's a nonstory. But we're not there yet.""",0.61697215,1019

Wintour has yet to announce any plans to retire but her advancing age -- she's 60 this year -- has stoked speculation that after more than 20 years in the role it might be time to leave. One name touted as a possible replacement is Carine Roitfeld, the highly respected editor in chief of Vogue Paris. Read more about Carine Roitfeld . Roitfeld is accustomed to the speculation, describing it as ""frustrating."" She told CNN she hadn't been offered the job and even if she was she probably wouldn't take it. ""It's a bit like for an actor. Do you want to go to Hollywood or do you want to stay here in Paris and do the cinema I like to do?,"" Roitfeld said. ""I think I prefer to stay here in Paris."" Watch Carine Roitfeld Revealed . A fixture at the U.S. title since 1988, Wintour has a fearsome reputation, mostly courtesy of the 2006 film starring Meryl Streep, ""The Devil Wears Prada."" The film is based on a book penned by a former assistant at American Vogue who has denied suggestions Wintour was the inspiration for the demanding and odious lead character. Roitfeld is anxious not to create any friction between her and her U.S. counterpart, telling CNN ""I think Anna does a great job... I think she's a great person."" She said she would be honored to be asked to fill Wintour's shoes, but pointed out that ""it's a very different job."" ""I'm very happy at French Vogue to be able to do everything -- almost everything -- I want in the magazine,"" she said. ""It would be too political at American Vogue for me. And I'm not sure I'm talking enough good English to work there."" At Vogue Paris, Roitfeld knows her readers. They are a select group of incredibly stylish and wealthy women who are thrilled rather than alienated by unconventional ideas. The best-selling edition so far, in August 2003, featured French actress Sophie Marceau on the cover smoking a cigarette. At French Vogue, there's less pressure to appeal to the masses. Its circulation of some 139,000 is dwarfed by the million plus readers of American Vogue. Fashion shoots are about fantasy. There's no imperative to make any clothes they feature wearable. If it's unusual and innovative, then it's in. With just 25 staff, Roitfeld describes the team at French Vogue as like a family. And that's how she prefers it. Having said that, she told CNN she wouldn't dismiss any offer out of hand. ""Of course I would consider it because it would be ridiculous not to consider such a huge position -- in terms of money and in terms of power,"" she said. ""But I'm very happy. It's very much a small team (in Paris). America is a huge team. I know because I've worked for them before. I think it's not for me.""",0.6153156,4535
148,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Think of a bullwhip and fedora and one man immediately springs to mind: Indiana Jones, the sardonic archeologist played by Harrison Ford in Steven Spielberg's '80s trilogy which started with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" ""If you learn how to talk I'm in deep trouble,"" quips Harrison Ford (right) to Vic Armstrong (left) on this photo which shows how similar the pair look. But if you were to venture on set during the filming of ""Raiders"" hoping to catch a few moments with the star you might have had a surprise. The tall, rangy man in the dented hat signing autographs could just as easily have been Ford's stunt double, Vic Armstrong. Back then, in the right light Armstrong could easily be mistaken for Ford -- both of them over six feet tall and bronzed with crinkly eyes. And it's this that is at the root of his success as Indy's ""fall guy."" In fact, Ford is a talented stuntman in his own right and Armstrong says that his biggest headache on set was trying to stop Ford from getting involved in action that was too risky. ""The biggest stunt I always say on the Indiana Jones films was stopping Harrison doing the stunts because I had to fight nearly every time to stop him,"" Armstrong chuckles. An accomplished horseman (his first career choice was steeplechase jockey), it's Armstrong's Indy you see galloping along in the stained khaki shirt and jumping from his horse onto a tank in ""The Last Crusade."" ""Technically very difficult,"" Armstrong says, ""I had to rely on a horse, and horses have a sense of survival and they don't actually do what you tell them to do as they haven't read the script."" It may have been his close resemblance to Ford that clinched the ""Raiders"" job but the pair developed a rapport that led Armstrong to work on the other two installments of the trilogy, ""Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade."" ""It always works better if you do have a relationship with [the actor]. You can mimic how they move, how they work when you coordinate fights for them like I did with Harrison,"" Armstrong tells CNN. Armstrong was just 16 years old when he started in the stunt industry in 1965. He utilised his horseriding skills to double as Gregory Peck in spy movie ""Arabesque."" He had to jump a huge moat and then fall off his mount but it was the simple lifestyle and travel that hooked young Armstrong -- ""Forty dollars a day and all you can eat. Fantastic living."" After over 40 years and countless movies, his filmography reads like a who's who of Hollywood: he has doubled for Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland, John Voight and collaborated with directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven, Michael Cimino and Sir Richard Attenborough. His work for three decades on classic Bond films like ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Live and Let Die"" cemented his reputation as a stuntman who could pull off complicated of stunts with precision. ""The films I've done I've been very lucky to have been very prolific in an area and a time when iconic films were being made. ""My first stunt on a Bond film was in 1966 in the winter of ""You Only Live Twice"". I was one of the ninjas coming down firing guns into the volcano, which for me was sensational."" He doubled for Roger Moore in ""Live and Let Die"" for a short while and was then propelled into working as a stunt coordinator and director of action units. Armstrong then added a superhero to his already impressive roster of action idols, standing in for Christopher Reeve in ""Superman."" Despite this, his allegiances lie solidly with cinema's 'real' heroes. ""If you look at ""Spiderman"" and movies like that, or the ""Incredible Hulk,"" they are far more computer-generated and so therefore slightly more cartoonish or video game-ish. ""My personal preference is for real action just enhanced or maybe helped by computers. We use computers to take away fall pads or wires if you're getting snatched or thrown in the air."" And in the spirit of keeping it real, Armstrong has gone to great lengths to help stuntmen achieve their crazy feats as safely as possible. In the 1980s he modified a tool known as the ""fan descender"" for the film ""Green Ice."" It would allow stuntmen to safely slow down when performing high freefalls. It revolutionized the stunt industry and in 2002 he was awarded a Science and Technology Academy Award for his invention -- the only one ever handed out to a stunt man. Earlier this year, he was honored by the Screen Actors Guild for his work on 2007 action horror ""I am Legend."" He has just finished work on ""The Mummy 3"" -- it was his prior commitment to this movie that stopped him working on the fourth Indy film ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" -- and is now stunt coordinating on the Weinstein production ""Shanghai."" Even after all this time, Armstrong, the authority on how to create a death defying stunt, still reckons Ford is the best stuntman actor he has ever worked with -- ""Harrison has to be the ultimate."" So why bother with a stunt double? ""I was cheaper and it didn't matter if I got hurt.""",0.6152373,4633
149,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- ""My One and Only"" begins with Renee Zellweger, playing a woman based on George Hamilton's mother Anne, discovering her husband with another woman. Renee Zellweger plays a woman based on George Hamilton's mother in ""My One and Only."" Despite the initial heartbreak, Anne puts on a happy face, and Zellweger gives life to a character who's determined to make the rest of her years comfortable and adventurous. Her husband's indiscretion is the catalyst that sends Anne on a cross-country quest to find a new husband in 1953 America. She pulls her two sons out of school in New York City and the trio set off on an adventure by car. The tale has its roots in actor George Hamilton's young life. The film takes a look at gender roles of the time and how women were perceived. Much of the film gets colored in by the characters and their ever-present emotions (though Zellweger's fabulous frocks add plenty of color on their own). Zellweger, who won an Oscar for ""Cold Mountain,"" spoke with CNN about ""My One And Only,"" George Hamilton and the way she believes she is perceived.  Watch Zellweger talk about playing Hamilton's mother » . CNN: What do you think of George Hamilton as a person now, knowing what he went through in his youth? Renee Zellweger: I think it's so fascinating. It was probably my favorite part of this experience, discovering that this was actually his life story. I mean, who knew? You have an idea about who a person is based on their public persona and the work that they've done. He's a spectacular actor, and his collection of parts that he's played and work that he's done is unbelievable. ... But to get to know him, he's so interesting. He's so clever, and he's very kind. Very kind. CNN: You're playing Hamilton's mother. Did he fill you in on what she was like? Zellweger: No. You know, that's what's so interesting about it. [Despite] being such a personal ... project that he worked on so closely with Merv Griffin for over a decade ... he didn't. He had great faith and he just kind of let us go, which was sort of unbelievable when you look back on it. It was really clear to me from what was on the page who she was. CNN: Did you like her? Zellweger: Very much. She's kind of doing the best she can, and she thought, oh everything's kind of a lark ... and things work out without your having to put your hands on it and make it happen. But she learns a different way and a more satisfying way to be involved in her own life, which is wonderful. So she sort of discovered that she could and gave herself permission to be in charge of herself. It was kind of a wonderful journey to watch. CNN: She was judged on her looks many times in the film. Have you faced similar situations, being judged on your looks and people not taking you seriously? Zellweger: Not in such an overt way. I'm not an actress who made her way based on physicality -- I think quite the opposite, in fact. I sort of disappear a little bit, with respect to my looks. I'm lucky. I'm not a standout, kind of knockout kind of girl that, you know, it's all about my great hair or something. But, in subtle ways, maybe. I mean, people presume to know you for something and respond to you accordingly, I'm sure. CNN: How was it stepping into the era of old Hollywood? Did you enjoy wearing the clothes from the early '50s? Zellweger: I loved it. I loved it. I had such a great time with it, and I brought a lot of my own things, actually. Things that have been given to me, things that I just would find while I'm traveling on the road but have no opportunity to wear. You know, junk store finds that I think are spectacular. We brought them in, spruced them up and made them costumes. It was really exciting; it was fun. CNN: Do you think you would have liked to work in that era? Zellweger: Oh, yes and no. Yes because the glamour of it all or the -- it feels like play to me. It's like playing dress-up all the time. And no because of the responsibility of having to maintain that immaculate presentation all the time would be exhausting. I think back on Marilyn Monroe putting those lashes on everyday, and I can't imagine, as I tie up my sneakers to go for a run. I cannot imagine that you're supposed to simultaneously look beautiful while you're going out to buy groceries. I just don't know that it would fit well with my personality. I don't know that I would succeed (laughs).",0.6146254,6938
150,"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- He's the butt-kicking, karate-chopping, kung fu superstar who rose from nowhere to conquer Hollywood in a spectacularly visual style. Action star Jackie Chan celebrates winning Best Actor at the 25th China Golden Rooster in 2005 . With his compact but wiry 5-foot, 9-inch frame, Jackie Chan seems to pale into insignificance when compared with muscle-bound Hollywood tough guys such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme. But combining extraordinary athleticism and an acrobatic style, Chan could probably take them both on in a fight and emerge victorious. Best known to western audiences as star of the Rush Hour trilogy, Chan is a prolific actor who has made more than 100 films spanning three decades. But success did not come easy for Chan, who made a string of flops in the early 1970s in Asia. He struggled for years to break out of the shadow of Bruce Lee, the undisputed kung fu king of the time -- even appearing as a stuntman in two of Lee's films. But in 1978, Chan landed his first hit in Asia with ""Snake in the Eagle's Shadow."" This was quickly followed by ""Drunken Master,"" which catapulted him to fame, and he suddenly became one of the highest-paid actors in the industry. Chan is credited with creating a new film art form, with his comedic take on martial arts, reminiscent of Buster Keaton's slapstick style. ""He totally reinvented Hong Kong cinema,"" said Renee Witterstaetter, author of ""Dying For Action: The Life and Films of Jackie Chan."" ""He created a new film art form, mixing humor with martial arts,"" Witterstaetter said. ""It was so different and unique.""  Watch TalkAsia's exclusive interview inside Jackie Chan's den » . Although a household name in his native Hong Kong and most of Asia, Hollywood seemed largely oblivious to his talents. It was not until 1994 when he made ""Rumble in the Bronx,"" which grossed $10 million in its opening weekend and made it to number one at the U.S. box office, that Chan finally cracked Hollywood. Soon big-budget hits such as the ""Rush Hour"" series and ""Shanghai Noon,"" followed. ""Rush Hour"" was Chan's first movie to break $100 million at the U.S. box office, earning $141 million, according to the box office tracking Web site, Box Office Mojo. ""Rush Hour 2"" made $226 million and ""Rush Hour 3"" has earned $137 million so far. His current cinematic venture sees him paired with longtime friend Jet Li in ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" in their first movie collaboration. Set in a mythic, ancient China, it is described as ""The Wizard of Oz with lots of martial arts."" The martial arts dream team have already seen ""Kingdom"" debut at No. 1 with $20.9 million in ticket sales last weekend, but Chan says the reason it took him so long to work with Jet Li is because he didn't like the Hollywood scripts they were initially offered. Chan, 54, is also quite candid about the fact that he doesn't like most of the Hollywood films he has made. He revealed to CNN: ""I didn't really like 'Rush Hour.' In America, everyone likes 'Rush Hour,' but in Asia nobody likes it. ""They like talking too much in America but in Asia they like to fight more in the films."" After the film wrapped in 1998, he wrote on his Web site: ""When we finished filming, I was very disappointed because it was a movie I didn't appreciate and I did not like the action scenes involved. ""I felt the style of action was too Americanized and I didn't understand the American humor."" Chan has certainly come a long way from his impoverished childhood in Hong Kong, where the story has it that his parents were so poor, they nearly sold him to a British doctor for less than $100. However, his parents instead enrolled him at the China Drama Academy, a talent school of hard knocks with a draconian regime that included training in music, acrobatics and martial arts that lasted 18 hours a day. Beatings were commonplace. Children were made to perform headstands for hours on end and Chan describes being forced to run, arms outstretched, carrying two full cups of water, with strict instructions not to spill a drop. With his parents now living in Australia, Chan stayed at the school for ten years and was adopted by his Master. Undoubtedly, the academy's grueling regime would later stand Chan in good stead, turning him into an incredibly driven and disciplined stuntman turned actor, who always choreographs and performs his own stunts. As a consequence, no insurance company will underwrite Chan's productions, which are legendary for his death-defying super stunts. They include water-skiing barefoot behind a speeding hovercraft, jumping off a building and swinging from a hot air balloon. Chan holds the Guinness World Record for ""Most Stunts By A Living Actor."" He also holds the record for the most number of takes for a single shot in a film, having shot over 2900 retakes for a complex scene involving a badminton game in ""Dragon Lord."" Unsurprisingly, Chan has suffered a litany of injuries in the course of his film career. Over the years, he has dislocated his pelvis and broken his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck and ribs on numerous occasions. When filming ""Police Story"" in 1985, he suffered second-degree burns to his hands and palms after sliding 100 feet down a pole festooned in Christmas lights. Many of the injuries have appeared, in eye-watering viewing, as outtakes or bloopers during the closing credits of his films. But in 1986, he came close to death while filming ""Armor of God,"" when he fell 45 feet from a tree and fractured his skull, leaving a permanent hole in his head. Chan explained to CNN's TalkAsia host, Anjali Rao that he never insists on doing his own stunts. It's just the way things are done in Hong Kong. ""Making a film in Hong Kong in the old days was not like Hollywood,"" he says. ""We didn't have protection like elbow pads and we didn't have the knowledge about safety. I had to risk my life jumping from building to building."" Chan is a one-man movie-making machine. He has his own production and distribution company -- Jackie Chan Emperor Movies -- and controls all aspects of the movie-making process, from casting to directing, producing, screenwriting, choreographing and stunt coordinating. He even has his own stunt team and casting agency. His director on the Rush Hour series, Brett Ratner told CNN's The Screening Room that Chan's versatility gives him the edge over other martial arts stars like Bruce Lee and Jet Li. ""Jackie is the most gifted actor of the three because he has the most range. Bruce Lee is a legendary performer and martial artist, but I don't think he is as funny as Jackie Chan. ""Jackie can be funny, he can be dramatic, he can do the action and the stunts, he can direct, edit, shoot. He is also a stunt coordinator so he is everything wrapped into one.""

""After 'Hostel 2,' I thought 'God, what can I make that's more offensive and upsetting than this film,' but somehow I did it with 'Nation's Pride,'"" Roth said. Roth viewed the black-and-white film as a character in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" a World War II fairy tale about a squad of Jewish-American soldiers who infiltrate behind enemy lines to terrorize the German army. Their plot to assassinate Hitler focuses on a small Paris, France, theater where Germany's leadership is gathered for the premiere of Goebbels' movie. The black-and-white film glorifies a fictional war hero played by Daniel Bruhl ""and the glory of the swastika and the power of Germany,"" Roth said. ""His courage was bound by duty. His legend was baptized in blood. His name will be crowned in glory,"" the trailer's narrator says as Pvt. Fredrick Zoller picks off dozens of American soldiers from a sniper's nest. ""Being Jewish, I wanted to make it a real propaganda film,"" Roth said. ""I was, like, I want to show what these movies are like. I don't want to do a sanitized version."" Using just 20 extras and five stuntmen, Roth shot the five-and-a-half-minute film in three days in Gorlitz, Germany, the same town where ""The Reader"" was filmed a year earlier, he said. ""The whole time we were shooting, we were, like, not only does this have to impress Quentin, this has got to impress the Fuhrer,"" he said. ""Hitler has to see this and go 'This is your finest work.'"" ""The German crew were going 'God, normally, we can't do this. This is so illegal.' And I was, like, 'this is what they did,'"" he said. ""This is what Joseph Goebbels would have done, and this has got to be honest and accurate."" While only parts of ""Nation's Pride"" are seen in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Roth said Tarantino will likely include the complete film as a bonus on the DVD.

152,"(CNN) -- It's been eight years since Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint first hopped on the Hogwarts Express, and the three have done little else since. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have kept each other ""level-headed,"" said Radcliffe. Now that the ride will soon come to an end, the cast is trying to fathom a life without the Harry Potter films -- an understandable difficulty, considering that they've grown up along with their characters. The other item showing its age is the storyline of the sixth installment, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Part humor and part horror with a healthy dose of hormones, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is clearly more attuned for an audience who, like the cast, are no longer in grade school. ""On the one hand, we have all this light romance and snogging, and on the other hand, people are getting killed, and bridges are being blown up,"" director David Yates said.  Potter 101: A guide to Harry Potter » . Heavy stuff, certainly, but it's a challenge on par with the stars' blossoming careers.  Hear, see and read how the characters have grown » . One can only imagine that by now, the Potter series feels like home to Daniel Radcliffe, who landed the title role at 11 after playing supporting roles in the BBC's ""David Copperfield"" and the 2001 film ""The Tailor of Panama."" ""[Without it], to be honest, I don't know what I would've done,"" said Radcliffe, who turns 20 on July 23. ""I had 'Copperfield,' but at that point I wasn't even dreaming about [acting] being a career then."" Since then, Radcliffe has grown into international stardom, reportedly earning $25 million per Potter film. Indeed, the actor has gotten raves away from the movie theater: In London and on Broadway, Radcliffe took on the role of Alan Strang, the mentally disturbed stable boy in Peter Shaffer's ""Equus,"" which required him to strip naked in the play's final scene. Radcliffe has also taken on roles in ""December Boys"" and the TV movie ""My Boy Jack,"" and he is eager to keep at it long after the Potter series wraps. So what about directing, then? Only time will tell, Radcliffe said. ""For now, I want to keep acting,"" the actor said. ""I don't think I know enough about the technical sides yet to even consider directing. It would be something that I'm interested in, but it would be a long, long way off."" As for Watson, when she's not occupied with filming, she can be found in the pages of fashion magazines -- including the advertisements. Having landed covers for both Teen Vogue and the UK version of Elle within the past few months, it's no wonder that the 19-year-old was chosen to be the face of Burberry's autumn line. Going from tween wizard to fashion icon is quite a leap, but it's one that appears to fit Watson well; how many other Hogwarts students can count Karl Lagerfeld among their friends? Like her co-star Rupert Grint (Ron), Watson didn't have any acting experience when she auditioned for ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" at age 9. She managed to beat out thousands of other girls for the role of Hermione, a part she's said was ""life or death"" for her. Now that the series is close to its end, the actress is eager to try new things. ""I would've told myself not to take it so seriously and to try to have as much fun as you can,"" Watson said she would've advised her younger self. But similar to her Potter character, Hermione, Watson is eager to hit the books after the series concludes. The actress confirmed that she plans to start college in the United States this fall. For Grint, the future is a bit more unclear. ""I don't know what I'm going to be doing, really,"" the actor told the Los Angeles Times. ""I'm going to miss it, I think, because I've been doing this my whole life."" Despite his start as an unknown -- Grint reportedly submitted hip-hop lyrics describing his character to snag the part of Ron Weasley -- he's arguably been the most adventurous of his co-stars, having played opposite Paul Giamatti in the 2002 family comedy ""Thunderpants"" and starring in 2009's sexually charged thriller ""Cherrybomb."" His third film outside the Potter series will be the indie ""Wild Target,"" co-starring another British sensation, Emily Blunt. iReport.com: Share your reviews of the latest ""Potter"" Whatever their plans, all three have a few years to go before they hang up their magic wands; the last installment of ""Harry Potter"" is being filmed in two parts, and the final film won't premiere until 2011.

He said that on the red carpet, ""[the fans are] cheering for a kind of person they see in newspapers and in interviews and in films, and that's a different person to you. You have to keep that -- that persona -- and the person you actually are as separate as you possibly can, and then you will avoid becoming arrogant.""

153,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Subtlety may not be in Kevin Smith's vocabulary, but a lot of off-color words are. They're sprinkled liberally throughout the writer-director's new movie, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" Kevin Smith can't understand why the word ""porno"" is still a hot button for some people. The comedy stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as roommates and longtime friends who decide that the solution to their money problems is to make a porn film. Strong language is nothing new for Smith, whose first film, ""Clerks,"" put him on the map with its merrily scatological musings. Though the film had little violence or exposed skin, it was initially given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA based on the language. ""Zack and Miri"" was also a possibility for an NC-17, considered the kiss of death by studios because of distributing and marketing challenges, until Smith argued its merits to the ratings board and received an R. Since ""Clerks,"" Smith's films have been almost wistfully romantic (""Chasing Amy,"" ""Jersey Girl"") or as joyfully profane as ""Clerks"" (""Dogma,"" ""Clerks II""). ""Zack and Miri,"" which opens Friday, is a blend of the two Smiths: full of sex and colorful language, but with a sweet side. Indeed, Banks told CNN not to be fooled by the film's tawdry talk. ""Kevin Smith is a huge romantic,"" she said. ""He likes to wrap up the romance in profanity, but the guy is more sweet than spicy.""  Watch why ""Zack and Miri"" is so controversial » . In an interview with CNN, Smith, 38, cheerfully acknowledged that this is not a film for prudes. The following is an edited version of the conversation. Kevin Smith: There's a bit of language in this picture. I'm not going to lie to you. ... I don't even think of it as salty. To me, it's just like part of a lexicon. CNN: Well, you do hear it a lot. Smith: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no doubt. We're raising our kid in a household where people curse, as an experiment. And I think our experiment is working, because I don't tame my language around the kid. I don't run up to her and yell [expletive] in her face, but I don't go out of my way to like not curse in front of her. And honestly, ironically, she doesn't curse. And I've tried to get her to curse for like friends and family, because it's always entertaining to hear a child curse, and she doesn't do it. CNN: Well ... I almost hesitate to ask, but tell me what the genesis was of the film. Smith: It's a movie I've been researching since I was like 12 years old, to be honest with you. And sometimes three or four times a day. ... But it only really came together when I saw Seth Rogen in ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and instantly fell in love with him and was like, ""I got to work with this guy."" ... So I started thinking about this movie, and immediately it kind of crystallized. Seeing Seth and thinking about porn, I was like, boom, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" I wrote the script with him in mind. And by the time I finished with it, ""Knocked Up"" was about to open, and the word was it was going to be huge, so I was like, we missed our window. This guy's going to be famous, and he'll want nothing to do with this movie. But I sent him an e-mail anyway where I said, ""Look, man, I wrote this flick with you in mind. Please give it a read."" ... And I got an e-mail back within five minutes that said, ""When I first came to Los Angeles, an agent asked me what I wanted to do with my career. I said I wanted to be in a Kevin Smith movie. That has not changed. Please send me the script; I would be honored to read it."" And I was, I was like cha-ching! You know, my God, it worked out. CNN: You're working with some professionals here, and by that I don't mean Seth and Elizabeth. I mean working with actual people with porn experience. Smith: We got ourselves a former pro. ... Traci Lords, man. Who, for the last 20 years, has not made an adult film. Has been keeping that industry at arm's length as she concentrates on a mainstream career and her musical career and stuff like that. But you know, it just seemed like if we're going to make this movie, Traci Lords would just fit into it so well. We approached her agent, and her agent was like, I don't know, it's got ""porno"" in the title, she ain't going to want to do it. Then she heard that Seth was in it, and she heard that I was making it, and so she was like, well, I'll at least read it. She came over to my house and read it. And I remember, I was sitting downstairs while she was upstairs reading it, and I was like, if I could go back in time and tell the 16-year-old version of me that Traci Lords is going to be hanging out in your living room ... my 16-year-old head would explode. First, the 16-year-old would be like, where'd you get a time machine, and then the 16-year-old would be like, does she want to have sex with us, and then I'd have to break it to the 16-year-old that, no, Traci Lords -- even many years from now -- [is] still not interested in your fat ass. So, she loved the material. ... Maybe it's time to embrace it and make fun of it. I said yeah, please do it. Katie Morgan is still active in the adult film industry, and she brought a kind of a current vision to it. She was able to kind of tell me where to put the camera to make things look as convincing as possible. So I was like, wow, man, this chick who most people know from porn has taught me how to direct. So if the movie looks any better than my normal stuff, it's probably because of Katie Morgan. iReport.com: Will you see 'Zach and Miri'? CNN: The title has created some challenges in terms of the marketing, that some newspapers are not taking ads for it and some buses and what have you. What do you make of that? Smith: I think it's strange that in this day and age, the 21st century, that people are hung up on a word, and the word is ""porno."" It's not like we put salacious posters out there. ... The poster is literally stick figures. ... People are afraid like, what if my kid asks what porno is? Just tell them. Tell your kid that the porno's not for you. My kid asked me what a porno is, I'm going to be like, guess what? Hannah Montana is not in it. Not yet. Are you still interested? Of course she's not interested in it, because it has nothing to do with her world. So I just think its kind of sad that like some people lobby against it. Like, based on the dude who called in, or the many people that called in after the Dodgers ran a spot. ... Just tell your kid, man; just be honest with them. It's like, look, [the] movie's not for you. ... It's crazy to me, because it's like, some people think that it's real porn that's being advertised. Can you tell me the last porno that you saw that had the word ""porno"" in the title? Like, it doesn't exist. I don't think it's ever existed. CNN: I understand that you were able to convince the MPAA to give you an R rating. Did that require any cuts? And if not, were you surprised? Smith: Initially, I was kind of surprised that they gave us the NC-17. Especially because the two areas they focused on were easily addressed: one ... they felt [was] gratuitous thrusting in the first porno sequence between Katie Morgan and Jason Mewes, and the other was what we'll call the egregious bodily fluid shot. ... I was able to go to the appeals process with the film, where you show it to a different audience. ... [You] screen it for [theater owners], and then you get up and do 15 minutes on why you feel it should be an R. Joan Graves [of] the MPAA gets up and does 15 minutes on why she feels it's an NC-17, then you get 10 minutes to rebut, she gets 10 minutes to rebut. You leave the room, and that audience makes the vote. ... You have to win by a two-thirds majority [to have the rating changed]. And they changed the rating. [The] appeals group that we screened for ... flipped it, gave us an R. And I didn't have to make a single cut, so everything I wanted in the movie is in the movie. That's kind of cool as a filmmaker. CNN: Your own presidential debate. Smith: A little bit. ... It was kind of like ""Inherit the Wind,"" but about porn, not the Scopes Monkey Trial.",0.61133105,3007
154,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Western cinema's relationship with martial arts has been a rocky one. Like many genres, kung fu has drifted in and out of fashion, but it has never regained the same popularity as its glorious heyday in the early 1970s. There's nothing funny about either Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris. And they've got the fists to prove it. After breaking into the United States and Britain with TV hardmen like The Saint and The Green Hornet duffing up the occasional bad guy, the revolution really kicked in at the cinema. When Bruce Lee -- who had already made waves in America as the Green Hornet's karate chopping sidekick, Kato -- appeared in the Chinese-made ""Jing wu men,"" or ""Fist of Fury,"" he established himself as the genre's poster boy. Lee found initial success in his native China, but with his next movies, ""Meng long guo jiang"" (""The Way of the Dragon""), which pitted him against U.S. karate champion Chuck Norris, and the classic ""Enter the Dragon,"" he became an international star. The plots of his films all followed a set structure: our gifted hero pursues a path of revenge or tough justice, accompanied by a stiff dose of morality. In this way his characters became representatives and protectors of the less powerful who have been unjustly treated. At the same time, the U.S. TV show ""Kung Fu,"" which started in 1972, raised the profile of martial arts, and, through the lead character Caine, built an image of the patient, wise man, who uses his skills in combat as a last resort when reasoning fails, and again, is motivated entirely by his unshakeable morals. The reluctant hero isn't a new concept: he's shared by the Far East and Wild West. The lone gunman in a western, too, tends to be loath to kill, and acts as the moral enforcer in a lawless place. But while the gunman in an isolated western town still commands the same respect from movie audiences as he lays down the law, our wise eastern mystic has almost entirely disappeared from Hollywood. The biggest martial arts stars today -- with the notable exception of Jet Li, who continues to take on a mix of serious art movies in China and gang-war films set on the streets of urban America -- are either laughed at or laughed with by western audiences. Kung fu superstar Jackie Chan has the impressive reputation of being almost indestructible. He does his own stunts and puts himself in some incredibly dangerous situations. But Chan is essentially a comedian. His stunts are used, in a very similar way to Chan's cinematic hero Harold Lloyd, to amaze and amuse an audience. We are shocked that someone could do the things he does, hanging off moving buses with a walking stick, leaping across buildings. He is almost superhuman, but it's done mainly for laughs. The other major kung fu stars have become figures of mockery. The Internet was awash with Chuck Norris gags pointing out just how strong he is (""Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits."") while Steven Seagal has done himself no favors by appearing in some of the worst films ever made. Hollywood doesn't take them seriously -- and nor do we. Directors have also mocked the 70s obsession with kung fu that gripped the western world, with heroes from films such as ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Austin Powers"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"" fighting with cod seriousness while displaying laughable skills. So what has changed? Kung fu is not inherently funny. No matter how many times you watch ""Enter the Dragon,"" it never ceases to be awe-inspiring. Perhaps the answer is simple: we Hollywood film junkies have grown cynical. There is no room in our modern world for an unexplained, almost supernatural power against pointlessly evil adversaries. Have we have lost our ability to suspend our disbelief? So what can a real fan do? Are we condemned to trawling the movies of the 1970s in order to get our kung fu hit, harking back to a time when Chuck Norris really was feared and respected everywhere he went? The answer is no. While Hollywood seems to have dumped its one-time darling, kung fu is alive and flourishing in Asia, where it all started. Jet Li puts out some great offerings in China, and there is a rising star in the form of Tony Jaa, a Thai actor with amazing technical skill, whose films like ""Ong Bak"" have wowed audiences across the world. While Hollywood misses a trick and spends all its time laughing at its most skillful martial artists, the industry in Asia is doing what it has always done: bringing us all the high kicks, karate chops and spinning nunchucks we could ever want.

155,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Bad dubbing, angry men with extraordinary facial hair, balletic fighting and more blood than you can shake a nunchuck at: just some of the key ingredients to make a perfect kung fu flick. Tony Jaa may be the modern day Bruce Lee, and in ""Ong-bak"" he shows off his impressive skills. Whether it's a traditional tale of ancient Chinese fighting mystics, or a slickly made, modern bloodfest, kung fu has always been a rich part of cinema. We've compiled a list of 10 of the best. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Share your views by using the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best. 1. Enter the Dragon (Robert Clouse, 1973) Bruce Lee's last movie before his untimely death, this is him at his very best. A man on a revenge mission, Lee travels to a mysterious island to fight in a deadly tournament hosted by an evil billionaire. Along with being technically amazing -- the nunchucks scene is jaw-dropping -- it's the most stylish and iconic martial arts film ever made. 2. Ong-bak (Prachya Pinkaew, 2003) Tony Jaa is a modern master. He has appeared in very few major releases, but has already made a huge impact. ""Ong-bak"" is the perfect showcase for his extraordinary skills: whether he's fighting a roomful of people or taking part in the most exciting chase we have ever seen -- jumping through rings of barbed wire and sliding under moving cars while doing the splits -- he makes this film every bit the martial arts spectacle. 3. Wong Fei Hung (Once Upon a Time in China) (Hark Tsui, 1991) Part Chinese history, part gripping kung fu movie, this eastern epic has Jet Li demonstrating his talents as the eponymous hero who stands up to invading foreign forces in 19th century China. Armed with a limitless arsenal of martial arts moves, Li takes on masses of gun-toting, badly acting opponents. A visual delight and Jet Li's best work. 4. Kill Bill 1 & 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004) Quentin Tarantino is a movie geek -- specifically, a B-movie geek -- and kung fu has long held a place in his heart. ""Kill Bill,"" his tribute to the genre, ticks every box: revenge; a powerful, all-knowing nemesis; stylish fights, costumes and music; and blood, lots and lots of blood. 5. Wo hu cang long (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) (Ang Lee, 2000) Every eye-catching detail of this touching and beautiful film works. A love story with outlaws, witches and Shaolin monks is augmented by breathtaking cinematography and some fantastic performances from Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and newcomer Ziyi Zhang. This visual feast tugs at the heart strings better than any karate chop could. 6. The Karate Kid (John G. Avildsen, 1984) A simple but well-executed plot sees Ralph Macchio's underdog work his way up an unconventional path to take on the mean and nasty establishment. It spawned a spate of copycat films, while thousands of children signed up to after-school karate; everyone now knows how to defend themselves by waxing on or off and that the best fighting move is obviously The Crane. Hiya! 7. Ging chaat goo si (Police Story) (Jackie Chan, 1985) Jackie Chan is probably China's biggest export to Hollywood, well-known for doing his own death-defying stunts. This is one of the films that got him noticed in the United States. When he fights, Chan is unstoppable: he uses every prop on the set and puts himself in enormous physical danger. Out and out fun. 8. Shogun Assassin (Robert Houston, 1980) Referenced several times in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" films, this forgotten classic must have set a record for the amount of blood spilt as our hero crosses the country on a revenge mission. Early on, Tomisaburo Wakayama says ""they will pay with rivers of blood""; he isn't wrong. Violent and wonderful. 9. Siu lam juk kau (Shaolin Soccer) (Stephen Chow, 2001) Should this be in the best or worst list? It's definitely unique. Once described as ""the best kung fu football film of all time,"" this is one of the more ridiculous films of the genre. A group of down-and-out martial arts experts form a five-a-side football team to take on a group of evil, drug-taking clones. It's as simple, and as silly as that. And it's one of our guiltiest pleasures. 10. The Matrix (Andy and Larry Wachowski, 1999) A sci-fi spin on the genre, this modern classic has all the key elements: our hero has superhuman powers; the bad guys, led by the relentless Agent Smith, form part of a shady, all-powerful organization intent on oppressing humankind; and the fight scenes are fantastically technical. Against all the odds, it appears Keanu really does know Kung Fu. .................................... Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Read others' comments and share your views by using the Sound Off box below. .................................... And the mainstream films that lacked the killer punch ... Street Fighter (Steven E. de Souza, 1994) Jean-Claude Van Damme has made some good films, really he has. ""Kickboxer"" nearly made it into our top 10. But this is, by a huge margin, his worst effort. Most depressing, though, is that this was the last major outing for Raul Julia -- not the way he should be remembered. Great game; terrible film. The Karate Kid, Part III (John G. Avildsen, 1989) The franchise came out of part two with a little credibility intact, but this last installment -- unless you include ""The Next Karate Kid"" (which no self-respecting ""Karate Kid"" fan would) -- managed to kill off our last shred of enthusiasm. Where the original might have inspired you to take up karate, this would put you off the sport, and probably kung fu movies too. Bulletproof Monk (Paul Hunter, 2003) ""I've got a great idea, let's take a well-respected Chinese actor and pair him up with an annoying teen-film actor in a mystical kung fu movie; it can't fail!"" Unsurprisingly, this film was a disaster, shoe-horning silly fight scenes into a plot that spirals from implausible to disturbingly stupid. A frightful mistake, and one of our worst-named films to boot. Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (Geoff Murphy, 1995) The first ""Under Siege"" was a surprisingly good film, and Hollywood's best martial arts expert acquits himself well, but this follow up is laughable. Seagal still fights like the best, but has lost the ability to speak, and whispers his way through the dialogue. Considering the action takes place on a train, we were amazed his co-stars could hear him. Come on, Steven, you were so much better when you were just a lowly, lowly cook. Game of Death (Robert Clouse, 1978) Through no fault of his own, this is Bruce Lee's posthumous contribution to the list. This tacky movie features fight scenes shot before Lee died, interspersed with material filmed using lookalikes and a cardboard cutout of the great man. The fights are impressive, but the rest of the film smacks of a cash-in -- they even use footage from Lee's actual funeral. A desperate slur on Lee's memory. E-mail to a friend .",0.6081791,5917
156,"(CNN) -- Whether they're raising their adopted baby girl, dodging homophobic quips from their fraternity brothers or teaching the ""Single Ladies"" dance to the football team after glee club, it seems gay characters are becoming a vital part of prime time TV. With characters like ""Modern Family's"" Mitchell and Cameron, Calvin from ""Greek"" and Kurt from ""Glee,"" the number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) characters on scripted programs has just about doubled since 2005, according to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation. And characters will continue to identify as LGBT as time goes on, such as ""Ugly Betty's"" Justin, who recently had his first same-sex kiss. But Jarrett Barrios, president of GLAAD said, ""We still have a long way to go before we're fully represented [on] TV."" In addition to the increasing number LGBT characters on scripted shows, which currently represents a little more than 3 percent of all leading and supporting characters on broadcast networks, there are also more openly gay actors and producers working in Hollywood, says Barrios. Actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson plays the character Mitchell on the ABC prime time show ""Modern Family."" Like his on-screen role, Ferguson himself is openly gay. ""The opportunity to play not only a well developed gay character, but a dad, a son and brother was really appealing to me. ... I chose to play him very close to myself and I think that truthfulness was appealing to the creators,"" Ferguson told CNN. However, Ferguson says his sexual orientation does not make him any more qualified to tackle a gay role than Eric Stonestreet, his straight co-star who plays Mitchell's partner Cameron. ""As a gay man and as someone who is an advocate for equality, truthfulness and fairness, I want to see more gay roles go to gay actors,"" Ferguson said in an e-mail. ""But then on the flip side, as an actor, I want to still be given the opportunity to play roles that are straight."" In a recent interview on The Joy Behar Show , Stonestreet said he's excited he has been given the opportunity to portray one half of a committed gay couple raising a child -- a first, he said, for broadcast TV. ""Our goal is to make people laugh, but while we're making people laugh, if we can open a couple minds here and there, that's also an added benefit,"" he said. And while shows like ""Modern Family"" are working to open peoples' minds about same-sex parents, the ""L"" and the ""T,"" of LGBT, are still waiting for their TV time, said Hollywood casting director Tammara Billik. It's very common for female characters to be portrayed as bisexuals instead of lesbians, she said. ""I wouldn't say it's because of a discomfort with lesbianism, it's just an interest in bisexuality,"" Billik said. ""[People] think it's hot, and it gives characters a wide variety of storylines."" And as far as the ""T,"" she said, ""transgender people are not represented in our daily lives with the same frequency that gay and lesbian people are. It's harder to find an audience that will embrace a transgender character."" Sean Smith, the executive producer of ABC Family's ""Greek,"" said he has loaned some of his own experiences as an openly gay man to the show. And when casting, an actor's sexual orientation does not come into play. ""When you're in casting, it's not appropriate or legal to say, 'Hey, are you gay?' Whether they're gay, straight, from the South, British or from Mars, it doesn't matter. The best person who captures that character gets the job."" And for Smith, straight actor Paul James was the best person for the role of Calvin Owens, a gay member of Omega Chi, a fictional fraternity on ""Greek."" James said he doesn't think twice about the intimacy between him and the three actors he's made out with on the series. His girlfriend doesn't either. It's just acting, he says. But with the exception of Neil Patrick Harris, who came out in 2006, playing a straight character on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" straight actors are more often tapped for gay roles, rather than the other way around. Or so it seems. ""Many gay actors, who are not out in Hollywood, are afraid (coming out) will compromise their ability to get roles,"" Barrios said. ""But [LGBT] actors need to feel as if they can be who they are and still make it in Hollywood or homophobia wins."" Both Ferguson and Smith identified themselves as gay before beginning careers in Hollywood, but Smith said he understands why some people are apprehensive about coming out once they're in the spotlight. ""People want to succeed and avoid any potential pitfalls, and coming out is definitely one that can draw attention to you that might make other people in this town fearful of hiring you,"" said Smith. ""For me, I've never really questioned it. I've worked with great guys. For them it wasn't an issue, but I'm aware of other parts of this industry."" People want to watch characters they can relate to, said Smith, who was very excited to welcome ""Modern Family"" into his living room. ""Jesse and I ... get so many compliments from gay couples and lesbian couples that want to introduce us to their kids and thank us for representing them on TV for the first time,"" Stonestreet told Behar. But still, ""Modern Family"" isn't hitting viewers over the head with Cameron and Mitchell's physical intimacy. ""We're the perfect show to just build it in naturally, not draw a bunch of attention to it,"" Stonestreet said. For Ferguson, it's a non-issue. ""I want the viewers to know Mitchell and Cameron's sex and love life is just fine,"" Ferguson wrote.

157,"LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters)  -- ""To insure or not to insure?"" It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week. Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list. But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. ""For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,"" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like ""The Parent Trap,"" is too risky to cast in a film.  Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles » . It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in ""Poor Things,"" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine.  See a gallery of Lohan's films » . A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. ""I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,"" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. ""It's pretty standard year to year."" But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be ""serious at this point."" She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted. Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, ""Georgia Rule,"" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management. Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. ""Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,"" Kingman said. He said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance. In certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples. In cases of known drug abuse, ""minders"" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor. Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. ""I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules,"" he said, citing the case of Robert Downey Jr., another high-profile star with a history of legal, drug and alcohol problems.

158,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Over the last decade, Steven Soderbergh has taken the ""one for them, one for me"" concept of film-director politics to an almost comically programmatic extreme. Benicio Del Toro plays Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara in Steven Soderbergh's biopic. Basically, he makes big-budget crowd-pleasers like the ""Ocean's"" films, stuffed with movie stars and candied gimcrack fun, and between them he makes whatever oddball labor-of-love doodle (the enticing ""Bubble,"" the dreadful ""Solaris"") enters his head. What's disorienting about ""Che,"" his two-part, four-hour-and-17-minute, studiously eccentric drama about the revolutionary life and times of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is that it's almost a knowing brainteaser on Soderbergh's part to force you to figure out which category the film belongs to. Che cost a reported $65 million to make, it's full of exacting panoramas of strategy and combat set in the mountainous jungles of Cuba and Bolivia, and its hero is a figure who -- 41 years after his violent death -- remains so loved, hated, and mythologized that he fits into an epic drama timed for awards season as perfectly as Gandhi or Ray Charles ever did. Following a one-week Oscar-qualifying run, ""Che"" is now rolling out to major American cities, where it is likely to draw generations of filmgoers who've either worn Che on their T-shirts or have the honest curiosity to wonder: Who was this man before he became a Warhol-worthy icon of radical chic? In ""Che,"" Soderbergh stokes that curiosity, feeds it, and frustrates it, all at the same time. He's made a film that embraces the romance of revolution only to shake it off, leaving very little in its place. The first half of ""Che"" is a genuine achievement. It picks up Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) in 1955, when he was a clean-cut Argentine physician who dreamed of uniting Latin America through armed struggle. At a dinner party in Mexico City, he meets Fidel Castro -- played, with perfect domineering gesticulations, by Demian Bichir -- and the movie follows these two into the Cuban countryside, where they assemble the nuts and bolts of a revolution. Soderbergh exhibits a tinkerer's fascination with how it all worked, embedding each scene with a docu-nugget of information. We see Che taming his asthmatic coughing fits or reading books between battles, and learn how a battalion of rebels could defeat a platoon three times its size (with surprise, daring, and Molotov cocktails). Che is by turns scholar, guidance counselor, drill sergeant, and comandante, and Del Toro makes him a warrior-saint who learns, against his will, to cultivate a gruff bruiser facade. He yearns to be a ""true revolutionary, the highest level of humanity,"" and it's no insult to the film to say that Soderbergh and Del Toro succeed in portraying Che as a kind of T-shirt in three dimensions, a Guerrilla for All Seasons. But that's when things get strange, if not monumentally perverse. At the end of Part I -- the victory of the Cuban rebels -- my appetite was whetted to learn even more about Che, in particular how his humane ideals were tested, and compromised, by the Castro regime as it edged toward dictatorship. Instead, Part II leaps forward to 1966-67, when Che led the revolutionary war in Bolivia, and here's the thing: It turns out to be the same damn movie. Only in this dispirited rerun, the revolution doesn't take. The rebels, all squabbling ego, can barely summon the will to sacrifice and die, and the peasants have little belief that this ragtag crew is bringing a better world. Even with the U.S. poking its nose into the region, the Soviet Union won't back an insurrection. Soderbergh has built ""Che"" conceptually, as two giant panels of war, and his message is about the doomed destiny of Marxism. Che, like Marx, believed that the rise of the proletariat was inevitable -- the unstoppable tide of history -- but as the movie reveals, he was wrong. Che didn't ride a wave of history; instead, it crashed down on him. By remaining the same, he becomes, in Part II, a distant and deluded figure whose dream evaporates around him. As political theater, ""Che"" moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly. Che doesn't grow richer, deeper, or reveal any contradictions; he just gets more abstract -- a symbol of idealism too pure for this world. Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been. EW Grades: Part I: B+, Part II: C . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

159,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The number of movies nominated for the best picture Oscar will double next year, a move apparently aimed at bolstering sagging ratings for the Academy Awards broadcast. Danny Boyle exults in an Oscar win for ""Slumdog Millionaire"" earlier this year. ""Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going allow academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories, but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,"" Sid Ganis, president of the Academy Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, said. Doubling the nominations would make it more likely a viewer's favorite movie is in the running for the top honor, which may make them want to watch the show, said Steve Pond, author of ""The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards."" ""This clearly is a reaction to declining ratings,"" Pond said. ""Even though this last show the ratings were up ... over the last 10 years or so the ratings have been down."" Oscar producers realized they ""can juice the show up all you want, but people watch the Oscars when there are movies competing that they have an interest in,"" Pond said. The best picture nominations often consist of movies that ""the vast majority of people have not seen,"" he said. The problem ""came to a head with 'The Dark Knight,' "" which sold more than $1 billion in tickets worldwide, but was snubbed by the academy in the best picture category last year, he said. The Batman sequel won best movie at the MTV Movie Awards and was chosen favorite movie by the People's Choice Awards. It also made many critics' top 10 lists. If the nomination field had been expanded last year, the film might have made the best picture list, ""which clearly would have been some kind of bump in the ratings,"" Pond said. This would also counter the impression among TV viewers that the awards show is ""for movie snobs who don't like the movies I like,"" he said. The decision to double the number of features films nominated is a return to the way the Oscars were awarded in its early decades, when as many as 12 movies were considered in the field of finalists, Ganis said. ""After more than six decades, the Academy is returning to some of its earlier roots, when a wider field competed for the top award of the year,"" Ganis said. ""The final outcome, of course, will be the same -- one best picture winner -- but the race to the finish line will feature 10, not just five, great movies from 2009."" Nominations for the 82nd Academy Awards will be announced on February 2, 2010. The awards show is set for March 7 at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre. A best picture nomination often serves as a marketing boost for films, driving DVD sales for those films no longer in theaters.",0.6035605,7491
160,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From bedroom creators to big studios, hand-drawn to CGI, animation has charmed and entertained children -- and, increasingly, adults -- for many years. The Screening Room went to Annecy in France to discover the secrets of success in animated films... Annecy has hailed animators like director Tim Burton, seen here receiving a special award at Annecy in 2006. Annecy is the Cannes of animation. The French town, which lies close to the Swiss border just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Geneva, has hosted the International Animated Film Festival for almost half a century and attracts a younger crowd than many of the major film festivals. With prizes for long and short features, television and student animation, Annecy highlights a wide variety of different types of animation and budgets. One veteran of Annecy is Craig Decker, known as worldwide cult figure ""Spike"" and co-founder of ""Spike and Mike's Sick & Twisted Festival of Animation."" Beginning 30 years ago as a means of bringing independent animation to new audiences, the touring festival was instrumental in showcasing the early works of legendary animators such as Tim Burton, Pixar's John Lasseter and Aardman's Nick Park, as well as the first episode of ""Beavis and Butthead."" Spike explained to CNN the challenge of getting animation taken seriously. He said, ""Originally we had to deal with the stigma. We showed great films like National Film Board of Canada [pieces], or ""Tin Toy"" by John Lasseter, works of art, masterpieces that take two to three years to make, and we had to deal with, 'What is it? Cartoons like Bugs Bunny or something like that?' And over the years we've educated the public, and we've put animation in the context of a very cool thing [with] a young, hip, adult audience of 18 and over."" Stop-motion classics . One of Spike and Mike's biggest fans, Nick Park, won the Annecy award for Best TV Animation with ""Shaun the Sheep,"" a spin-off from ""A Close Shave,"" one of Aardman's famous Wallace and Gromit short features that grabbed an Oscar. Stop-motion is also close to the heart of director Tim Burton, who employed the technique on ""Corpse Bride"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" He said, ""Because it's such an old-fashioned technique, a lot of it truly has to do with finding the right group of animators, the right group of people to build the puppets, because a lot of things are being done by computer now. Very few people are doing this style of animation."" Allison Abbate, a producer on ""Corpse Bride,"" added, ""Stop motion is an age-old process as far as animation in film-making goes. It hasn't really changed since the days of King Kong - we used new technology in 'Corpse Bride' to bring it into a new century."" Appropriate animation . ""I think there's room for all types of animation,"" she continued. ""It depends on the story. The story should really decide how you tell it. I think there are stories that are better made in 2-D and CGI and that's what you'd go for."" 2-D animation is the mainstay of Japanese anime - a subject so vast it will command its own feature in a subsequent edition of the Screening Room. The film ""Paprika"" has won worldwide critical praise during the past year as a sophisticated example of the art, whose keenest supporters are sometimes contemptuous of their Hollywood animation counterparts. Asia is becoming an increasingly powerful force in animation, where companies who traditionally provided a cheap source of labor for animation studios are now using their skills to take a leading role in the creative process. UTV Toons is one of several Indian companies forming partnerships with big U.S. production houses to make new animated features. Combination of skills . Animation requires a combination of several skills, as producer Allison Abbate explained. She told CNN that animators face many complex challenges. ""Animators have to know how to move things, how things work anatomically in a space, but they also have to know how to act, how to emote and that is what makes animation so different from live action. It is so crafted, one frame at a time."" But Spike points out that the rewards animation promises can be very high. ""Obviously in features, look at the most successful films,"" he told CNN. ""They're nearly all animated Pixar pieces or, if it's live action, it's the special effects animation that carries the film."" And the future? Spike believes animation is going mobile. He said, ""Internationally, what's exciting is with new media: with digital; with broadband; with mobile phones. That's where we're going with our stuff."" E-mail to a friend .",0.6023308,1701
162,"(InStyle.com) -- So you're finally ready to settle down and make that marriage proposal? There's no better time to do it than engagement season, which, lucky for you, is now! Get inspired by these uber-romantic celebrity proposals. Brandon Routh popped the question to Courtney Ford while on a picnic. Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict . Although the set of a slasher movie seems an unlikely place for romance to bloom, that's just where it happened for actors Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict. Shortly after shooting began in 1999 on their film ""Hollywood Horror,"" the co-stars started spending time together. Seven years later, on Christmas Day 2006, Hardrict, 32, told Mowry, 30, that he wanted to give her a promise ring. Then, as her entire family looked on, the ""Lincoln Heights"" actor yelled, ""Psych!"" and got down on one knee to present her with a 1.5-carat diamond engagement ring. Antonio Pierce and Jocelyn Maldonado . Antonio Pierce, an NFL linebacker, met Jocelyn Maldonado during a celebrity appearance at an ESPN Fantasy Football Draft. Maldonado, a model at the event, instantly caught his eye. Pierce and Maldonado (who now hosts Mets Weekly) were inseparable over the next six months. In February 2007, Pierce treated Maldonado to a helicopter ride above Manhattan, New York, before dining at Brooklyn's The River Café. Famous for its chocolate Brooklyn Bridge cake, Pierce conspired with the restaurant's manager to place the engagement ring atop the confection, which was covered with pink rose petals. Howie Dorough and Leigh Boniello . Backstreet Boy Howard ""Howie"" Dorough got more than he bargained for after hiring Leigh Boniello to be the band's webmaster in December 2000. Boniello went on tour with the group and quickly grew close to Dorough. Six years later, the couple attended a New Year's Eve party at the New Jersey home of Boniello's father. ""I figured, what better timing,"" says Dorough, ""because all of her family was going to be there, including her 92-year-old grandmother."" Just before the stroke of midnight, Dorough made a toast and presented Boniello with a custom-designed three-stone diamond engagement ring. Brandon Routh and Courtney Ford . Three years before actor Brandon Routh donned those famous blue tights, he tended bar at Lucky Strike Lanes in Hollywood. During a party there in 2003, actress Courtney Ford repeatedly poured out the drinks he made her as a ruse to chat him up. ""I kept asking him for another drink, telling him the one before was too strong,"" she recalls. In 2006, Routh purchased the 3-carat diamond ring that had caught Ford's eye during an earlier visit to Neil Lane. But since the two were traveling for the Superman Returns press tour, Routh asked Gilbert Adler, one of the film's producers, to hold the ring until they arrived in England. ""Poor man!"" says Routh. ""He carried it around for two and a half weeks."" Finally, while picnicking in Glastonbury, Routh popped the question. Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter . Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter became friends after meeting at a party in 2006 and Sanchez immediately pegged him as perfect husband material. She found out for certain that he felt the same way just two days before Christmas 2007, under a full moon at midnight, in a bay off the coast of the Puerto Rican island Vieques. The two were seated in a double kayak, taking in the bioluminescent organisms shimmering in the water all alone, except for a tour guide in a second kayak. The scene should have been pure bliss, except that Sachez was concerned when their guide speedily paddled away. ""The guy knew to take off so Eric could propose, but imagine how I felt floating in this huge bay in the middle of the night with nobody around,"" Sanchez explains. ""I started calling back, 'Senor, hello! Come back!' until I realized something was going on."" After an ""amazing speech,"" Winter pulled out a 4.3-carat brilliant-cut diamond ring by Michael Barin, Sanchez's favorite jeweler. But her joy was soon laced with anxiety over the fact that such a costly bauble was surrounded by acres of sea. ""I said, 'Put it away, please. I don't want it to drop in the water!'"" Anna Chlumsky and Shaun So . Actress Anna Chlumsky, 27, best known for her role in ""My Girl,"" was awaiting her seven-year anniversary with college sweetheart and army reservist Shaun So, 28, and hoping he might pop the question. While they were having breakfast at a café in her neighborhood a week before their anniversary, Chlumsky described a cocktail ring a friend was selling. So, who had been carrying an engagement ring for two weeks in anticipation of the perfect moment, pulled out the 1-carat, cathedral-mounted, radiant-cut bauble and asked, ""Does it look anything like this?"" Guiliana DePandi & Bill Rancic . It started out all business: Giuliana DePandi was interviewing Bill Rancic, first-season winner on ""The Apprentice"" and co-host of the Chicago, Illinois, TV show ""In the Loop with iVillage."" But when the cameras stopped rolling in April 2006, a whirlwind -- and adventurous -- romance began. Eight months later, when Rancic, 36, popped the question during a chopper flight over Chicago, complete with champagne, Giordano's deep-dish pizza (DePandi's favorite) and Michael Bublé tunes piped into the headset. ""Bill told me we were going to look at Christmas lights,"" says DePandi. ""It was dark in the helicopter, so I didn't really get a look at the ring until the next day, when I went into shock for the second time,"" she says of the 4-carat cushion-cut diamond in a micro pavé setting Rancic helped design. Jeri Ryan and Chistophe Eme . ""He was hot!"" Shark star Jeri Ryan, 39, recalls of first glimpsing her future husband, Christophe Emé, 38, at a food-related charity event four years ago. ""He looked good in his chef's hat, and he had this ornery little spark in his eye that I really enjoy."" After dating for two years, the couple opened Ortolan, their celebrated French restaurant in Los Angeles, California. The proposal came soon after. ""One night, Christophe covered my eyes and took me into our bedroom,"" recalls Ryan. There the die-hard romantic had placed candles, champagne and a canvas painted with the messages ""And you come with me forever"" in French and ""Grow old along with me"" in English. Emé then presented Ryan with a made-to-order cushion-cut solitaire set in pavé diamonds. Jason Priestley and Naomi Lowde . Fate has looked after Jason Priestley. On Valentine's Day 2000 the actor met Naomi Lowde, a makeup artist from Hertfordshire, England, while walking back from a play rehearsal in London. ""I was smitten,"" says Priestley, now 36. The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum and Lowde, 27, immediately began dating, and in 2002 they moved back to California together. That's when fate took another turn: On August 11, 2002, Priestley was driving his race car on a Kentucky track when he hit a wall at 180 mph. Though he sustained three skull fractures, a broken back and a bleeding artery in his neck, he pulled through. ""It was a tough time, but it was also magical because we kept each other's spirits high,"" says Lowde. ""We pushed two beds together in the hospital and put Swifty, our French bulldog, in the middle. We were together 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for three months."" In May 2004 Priestley arranged another trip to London, England -- to the very street corner where he and Naomi first met, where he presented her with an emerald-cut, three-diamond ring by Steven Pomerantz. Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell . What happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas -- and for Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell, that's not a bad thing. Nearly four years ago the two ran into each other poolside at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. ""I was working on a documentary, and Jerry offered to help,"" recalls Romijn, 35. ""He spent a week operating the microphone, but later he told me he would have done anything. I don't think he really cared about the project, if you know what I mean."" For their first date the couple went to see the Blue Man Group with friends, and O'Connell had Romijn in stitches. ""It was this whole Jerry show in my ear. That's how it is with Jerry. You get sucked into it!"" Evidently: A year and a half later, on September 18, 2005, O'Connell, 33, proposed to Romijn in New York with a diamond ring from Simon G. ""I got down on one knee, asked her to marry me and said, 'You better say yes' a couple of times -- there was a little bit of a pause on her part,"" says O'Connell. Romijn's take? ""Not true!""

164,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage has pretty much got this acting thing down. After all, he started acting at the age of 15 and, well, he's got that Oscar. Nicolas Cage says that Academy Awards are ""not as important as children and making them happy."" So he doesn't really need to deliver another gut-wrenching performance to demonstrate his chops. In fact, he can deviate from a traditional film and venture into animated territory. He's voiced animated characters in the past, but in Disney's new 3-D tale ""G-Force,"" Cage lends his voice to a mole. Speckles the star-nosed mole comes to life thanks to the film's impressive digital animation and Cage's voice. At first it's unclear that Cage is the voice behind Speckles, because he changes his sound for the critter, er, character. CNN talked to Cage about playing a mole, animated films and his taking walks in the forest. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: What do you play in this film? Nicolas Cage: I'm playing Speckles, the mole, and he's an outsider. He's an iconoclast -- he doesn't fit in. He doesn't get into the fray with the ""G-Force,"" the other guinea pigs. But his IQ is off the charts, and he's a technological wizard. CNN: So, you're an Academy Award-winning actor, and you decided to play (this role). How did this come about? Cage: To me, nothing's more sacred than the magical world of children, and with everything that's going on in the world, it gets increasingly more challenging to keep our kids smiling -- people are losing their jobs, families are tense. So anything I can do to give families something to look forward to and to put a smile back on children's faces -- I'm gonna do. Disney has a great tradition of enchanting children and giving them something to behold. I mean, you mention Academy Awards -- I mean, that's not as important as children and making them happy. CNN: Tell me about your voice: Why did you decide to really change it when you read the script? Cage: Mel Blanc is a hero because of what he could do with his voice for all the Looney Tunes, the Warner Brothers cartoons, to be the voice of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig. To me, he's a great actor. I mean, one of the great character actors, and I knew that if I was gonna be in this movie, I'd want to do something like that and transform my voice. CNN: So you're clearly comfortable playing a mole? Cage: I'm comfortable with the mole, yeah. I mean, yeah, he's different, he's got issues, you know? I don't want a perfect character, I want a character who has, as strange as it sounds, some humanity, some flaws, some needs. But to be fair, I'm not in a lot of this movie. This is Darwin's movie, um Sam Rockwell and Penelope Cruz's movie -- they're the stars. I'm only in it at the beginning and the end. CNN : You seem to be a big fan of animated films. Cage: I do enjoy animated movies. I really love anime and movies like ""Spirited Away"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle."" I like movies where you feel like you're going into another world, and no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna see something new in that world. That level of detail really inspires me. CNN: Is there less pressure doing an animated film and lending your voice to a character as opposed to a traditional film? Cage: Well, you don't have the pressure of the camera. And that's -- that's very liberating. And you don't have the pressure of other actors trying to remember their dialogue or not being in rhythm with you. The challenge though is, these movies take years to make, and I may not be in the same state of mind I was in a year ago or two years ago, and then they tend to pull you out of wherever you are and put you back in a box, and then try to get the voice out of you again, so that's the rub. CNN: Have you gotten pretty good at honing your skills when it comes to choosing roles, or is it always a risk? Cage: I mean it is always a gamble. You never know what's gonna happen with a movie. But I think it's more of a matter of, am I doing something that I believe in on any level? Like, am I going to entertain children, or am I going to make a movie that I can stand by because it means well on some level? That's becoming more and more a part of the criteria. CNN: How do you think you've changed as an actor throughout your career? Cage: I think I've become more relaxed. I don't feel the need to jump up and down and make a big noise to get people to pay attention to me. I don't need to um, you know, do punk rock gestures or eat a cockroach or do something weird to say I exist. I feel like I'm hearing a different kind of sound now. It's a much more subtle sound, but it's still a truthful sound, that I can express myself in, in roles that are much more relaxed and seasoned as opposed to boisterous and rock and roll. CNN: What's inspiring to you, in every day. Cage: Well, I find children inspiring. The way they look at the world. The magical world they live in, to me, is inspiring. I like -- I mean, I'm afraid I'm gonna answer your questions and sound like a complete nature addict here, but uh, I like nature, I enjoy going for walks, I like the ocean, I like the forest. CNN: Is that what you do when you're not working, that's important to you in your life? Cage: Yes. Yes, I like to go for walks in the forest.",0.59761095,6629
166,"Ann Arbor, Michigan (CNN) -- Even among the hundreds of applications, this one stood out. Most applicants to creative writing programs submit stories about the angst of their suburban childhoods. This writer's stories concerned the daily ordeals of a boy living with his family on the streets of Nairobi, Kenya, and the horrific plight of a Rwandan girl whose mother is Tutsi and father Hutu. Not only did the applicant have what writers call ""material,"" he was blessed with an uncanny ear for human speech and the poetry to describe his characters' very unpoetic lives. I can still remember the young Kenyan boy watching his mother decant the glue she intends to sniff. The glue, the boy tells us, ""glowed warm and yellow in the dull light,"" and when his mother had poured enough, ""she cut the flow of the glue by tilting the tin up. The last stream of gum entering the bottle weakened and braided itself before tapering in midair like an icicle."" Still, this applicant gave us pause. The writer had so much to say, he seemed to be trying to channel a raging waterfall through the tiny funnels of two short stories. His use of punctuation was idiosyncratic, to say the least. And the applicant was a priest! Would the other students be willing to share their stories, rife as these tend to be with profanity, drugs and sex, if a clergyman was in the room? And would this particular clergyman understand what all great religious writers know -- that true literature doesn't spring from one's certainties about the universe, but rather from one's questions? That said, how could our students be inhibited by a classmate who didn't hesitate to describe a 12-year-old Kenyan prostitute being paid by rich white tourists to perform sexual acts with their monkey? As to the shapelessness of the applicant's prose and the eccentricity of his punctuation, anyone with this writer's gifts could be taught to structure his material and punctuate his characters' speech correctly. If I still felt apprehensive about having a priest in my workshop, that anxiety vanished when Uwem Akpan walked in the room. Rather than wear his clerical garb and collar, Uwem showed up in a blue and maize University of Michigan sweatshirt. With his wide, gap-toothed smile, wall-shaking laugh, disarming candor and gleeful giggle, he exuded magnetic charm. Nor was Uwem out of place for being the only Nigerian in his cohort. Despite what the judges of the Nobel Prize might say about American writers being too insular to compete with their European counterparts, this country's MFA programs provide one of the only spaces on the planet where writers of many races, religions, nationalities and sexual orientations can come together. Writers find common ground not through the homelands they once inhabited but the thematic questions with which they grapple. Early that first semester, I assigned a story by Philip Roth called ""Defender of the Faith,"" in which a Jewish sergeant who has witnessed the horrors of the concentration camps must decide whether to grant special favors to the Jewish recruits in his command or enforce strict impartiality. I didn't know whether Uwem would connect to Roth's quintessentially Jewish outlook. But the moment the discussion started, Uwem's hand shot up. ""This is the story of my continent!"" he declared. If Africans continued to put tribal allegiances above universal fairness, Uwem said, progress would remain unattainable. This abhorrence of tribalism is what makes Uwem so open-minded. Like most people who are comfortable in their own skins, he is wonderfully able to inhabit the skins of others. One semester, he audited a seminar on Holocaust literature. The professor had no idea who Uwem was, so she couldn't help but be surprised when he asked, ""Can you tell me, please, how is it that people can do such terrible things to one another?"" If anyone else had asked that question, the professor might have thought he was simpleminded. But she could tell that this mysterious stranger was asking his question in the most profound way, from the depths of his own experience. A few months later, Uwem accompanied me to my temple for the Jewish New Year. After sitting -- and standing -- for hours through the service, he commented that he had studied in the Bible how Jesus opened the scroll to read, but he had never quite understood how that worked, so it was beautiful for him to see how the Jews really did that. And he was happy to note what Catholicism had copied from Judaism. Just as Uwem opened his mind and heart to us, I opened my mind and heart to Uwem. An atheist with a degree in physics, I don't believe in prayer. And yet, when Uwem stopped by the evening before a frightening operation on my spine, I granted his request that he pray for my well-being. Startled by the warmth I felt flowing along my spine as Uwem held his hands above my head, I burst out crying. Of course, my colleagues and I never forgot why Uwem was in Ann Arbor, Michigan. During his two years in our program, all of us worked hard to help him develop his many gifts. But mine was the first workshop Uwem took, and I saw his stories at their rawest. As I waded through the reams of rough drafts he had given me, it occurred to me that I had been called upon to help the children of Africa the only way I could -- by helping Uwem to write their stories. We talked about the need to focus each story around a single character's conflict and a single thematic question rather than attempting to convey everything Uwem knew about all his characters. I also urged him to allow his young protagonists at least a chance for freedom or redemption. Yes, the children whose lives he wanted to depict were the victims of adults who abused, exploited and betrayed them. But even in a society in which a child can be prostituted to provide her family's food and pay her brother's school fees, the prostitute's brother might choose to decline that money, to leave the family, to walk away. Uwem listened attentively, but I wasn't sure that he believed what I was saying. I didn't see another version of his story about the street family in Nairobi for several months. When I did, the hairs at the back of my neck stood up. That second version of ""An Ex-Mas Feast"" was so powerful and finely polished that I asked Uwem if he would send it to the deputy fiction editor of The New Yorker, whom I had met a few weeks earlier when the magazine brought its college tour to Ann Arbor. Uwem hesitated -- I didn't know this, but he already had submitted an earlier version of the story, twice, to ""The Editor"" at The New Yorker -- but I kept nagging him until he sent the new version. The rest, as they say, is history. The magazine accepted Uwem's story for its fiction issue. Then, a year later, it published a revised version of the story about the half-Tutsi, half-Hutu Rwandan girl. In many ways, Uwem's success makes sense. Even when he was studying to be a priest, he gave up precious hours of sleep to stay up writing. He applied to an MFA program and got accepted. His teachers recognized his extraordinary potential and helped Uwem to achieve it. And yet, much of Uwem's success is inexplicable. In a world in which so little attention is paid to children's suffering, a world in which fewer and fewer publishing houses remain interested in acquiring literary fiction and independent bookstores, even in college towns such as Ann Arbor, are closing their doors, the editors at every major publishing house in New York competed for the privilege of publishing a book that might not sell many copies but had shaken them to the core. And Oprah ... how could Oprah, who had never selected a collection of stories for her book club, choose a collection like Uwem Akpan's, with its multilingual patois, complete absence of pathos or sentimentality and nearly unbearable-to-read violence toward children? Yet all of this came to pass. Oprah respected her audience enough to assume that if she was so deeply moved by Uwem's stories, they would be moved as well. In choosing ""Say You Are One of Them,"" Oprah brought to Uwem's cause the intelligence and heart of her many readers. That any of this happened at all, let alone in five short years, is a literary miracle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eileen Pollack.",0.5975586,6927
167,"(CNN) -- CNN.com reader Kristy O'Connor took a prenatal yoga class with Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams and says she was ""in awe of his devotion and attention to Michelle."" Reader Dena Michnowih says she came across Ledger in Brooklyn, New York, teaching his young daughter Matilda her right from her left, and was enchanted. Heath Ledger is pictured with crew of the 2005 film ""Lords of Dogtown"" and members of the Zephyr skating team. CNN.com asked readers to share their memories of Ledger, who was found dead in a New York apartment Tuesday, January 22. Famous for his roles in the films, ""The Patriot"" and ""Lords of Dogtown,"" Ledger was widely acclaimed for his portrayal of the homosexual cowboy Ennis del Mar in 2005's ""Brokeback Mountain."" CNN.com readers describe meeting Ledger in person, and call him humble and kind. Below are a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.  Donal Logue, actor, of Los Angeles, California  I met Heath eight years ago while working on ""The Patriot."" He became a star while we were sequestered away in a small town in South Carolina based on the strength of the dailies going back to Los Angeles. Heath was a fantastically kind and sweet young man. He surrounded himself with his friends from Australia and never forgot any of us he ever worked with. I last saw him in Australia when he called my name on a Melbourne street and introduced me to Michelle, his (then) pregnant [girlfriend]. I have great memories of going for runs with him or watching a bootleg copy of a Parker and Stone's musical called ""Cannibal! The Musical of the Donner Party Tragedy."" Heath must have been in a place of great pain and sadness to be split from his wife and child. He was sensitive and unfairly victimized in his native country by the unfortunate Australian custom called the ""tall poppy syndrome"" in which an Australian, the second he or she achieves global success, is immediately and arbitrarily accused of losing all of their humanity. Not true. He was a sweet person, and less importantly, an unbelievably talented actor. Maybe the best of his generation. Dan Bova of Larchmont, New York  Once when I was driving in Brooklyn, I got a flat tire. As I was jacking up my car, this deep voice from behind me said, ""Need a hand?"" It was Heath Ledger. I couldn't believe it. He helped jack up my car and change the tire. He was really good with tools! R. of Perth, Western Australia  I grew up with Heath around the speedway racing circuit. I remember the night he was a little boy and his Dad was racing speed cars at Claremont Speedway (my dad was in the race, too). His dad was coming 3rd then in the final corner, the two lead cars spun out and Heath's dad Kim took the lead and won the State Title race. Heath was standing a couple of rows in front of me with his mum and sister and they were all so excited, jumping up and down and cheering. He was about as happy as a little boy could be watching his dad become a champion. I remember that night because in the years that followed, I saw his parents marriage break up and it was like there was this moment in his childhood of pure joy that I witnessed. Later Heath would pit crew for Graham Jones, and I crewed for my dad and brother. Heath and I were both the youngest on our crews so that meant our job was to take the fiberglass bonnets over to the hoses and wash the mud off after each race really dirty work but he managed to stay cleaner than the rest of us. Crystal Davis of Toronto, Ontario  I met Heath in L.A. at a mall a year or so ago. I was staring at him working up the nerve to ask for an autograph. He saw me, started laughing and walked towards me. He said I was white as an ""egg"" and asked if he could do anything. I said, No thanks ... yes I forgot to ask for the autograph. He touched my shoulder and told me to take it easy and walked away. He looked back several times and smiled. What a great memory I have of him. My prayers go out to his family and friends. Dena Michnowich of Glen Cove, New York  I was walking in the lower east side of Manhattan one day and I noticed a really cute man holding his little daughter on his shoulders. She looked just like him. He told her that they had to make a right and asked her to point them in the right direction, which she did. I soon realized that it was Heath Ledger and I got really excited. I was walking right up to them as they were waiting to cross the street. When I got close, I waved and he smiled at me. He was so handsome I got the chills. I could also sense that he had a very sweet spirit. It was a very special moment for me. I'm so sad to hear that he died. Leanne Scorzoni of Staten Island, New York  I worked as a nanny for a number of years in Manhattan, and I ended up having a toddler class with my charge and Heath, Michelle and baby Matilda. The couple was so polite and laid back at first I didn't recognize who they were. They were genuinely interested in their child, her development, and treating the rest of us (including staff) with respect. He will be sorely missed. Michael Williams of Perth, Western Australia  I met Heath Ledger many years ago while I was working at a local fast food outlet here in Perth Western Australia. He came through to order and I was amazed at how polite, kind and friendly he was. He stopped to sign autographs while he waited knowing that to the people asking him he was somewhat of a hero. He did all this with the great Australian attitude that he had and a smile on his face, he was one superstar that took stardom well and in his stride, I for one feel thankful that I have met this great person. I send my deepest sympathy to his family and say to them that you do not mourn his passing alone; the people of Perth share your grief. Tracy Kimball of Rock Hill, South Carolina  I met Heath Ledger in 1999 while he was filming ""The Patriot"" in South Carolina. I was a reporter for a daily newspaper there and he was at a press conference about the movie at Historic Brattonsville, a Revolutionary-era plantation. He was so very kind and was more than happy to sign my newspaper. The media was flocking around Mel Gibson, but seeing a new young and dashingly gorgeous guy standing off to himself, I approached him and asked for his autograph. He flashed that smile, grabbed my pen and used my back to sign the newspaper I was holding. We had a conversation, but I don't remember it because I was so enamored. I had never heard of him before because the only American movie he had filmed was ""Ten Things I Hate About You,"" which I had not yet seen. I went back to the paper where I worked and wrote a story about the new hot Aussie star that would surely become hugely successful in America. His death really saddens me. He was such a talented actor and a new dad. Having a child the same age as his daughter, it makes me even sadder to think of her missing her father. Amanda Olmstead of Penticton, British Columbia  I met Heath when he was filming ""Brokeback Mountain"" in my hometown of Fort Macleod. He was a down to earth man with amazing talent. His portrayal of Ennis del Mar was life-changing for many of my friends. I am truly saddened by his death. Kristy O'Connor of Sydney, Australia  My heart goes out to Heath's family and little Matilda, I met Heath one time at a prenatal yoga class in Sydney with Michelle and was in awe of his devotion and attention to her. He was a true gentleman and I'm sure an amazing father. To make assumptions as to how or why he died is to bring more pain to an already devastated family. Adrian K. of Perth, Western Australia  I met Heath one night on the town in Perth. The one-degree of separation rule in Perth made him a friend of a friend. We had a brief and quiet chat. What struck me was his calm in the face of his monstrous burgeoning celebrity. With both of his feet planted firmly on the ground, he seemed to be facing the publicity with stoic resolve. Goodnight, Heath. You were a good bloke. ""A sad fan"" in Chicago, Illinois  I was an extra in the movie ""Dark Knight,"" which filmed in Chicago this past summer. I spend an entire weekend on set with Heath. He was rather quiet most of the time between takes, but seemed to be a nice, likeable guy. It was great to watch him work, as he was very committed to his craft. His death is a great loss. Kelly Fishburne of West Palm Beach, Florida  I met Heath Ledger while working in Atlanta. We both were taking a CNN tour. He was silly, smiling all the time and we spoke about horses and riding lessons. He was also talking about the movie the Patriot he filmed with Mel Gibson. He had to do lots of riding. He was down to earth and so very talkative. Just a normal guy, hanging out. A real gentleman. Jessi Lee of Central, South Carolina  I really enjoyed Heath's acting. His best movie was my favorite movie of 2005, ""Lords Of Dogtown."" Heath played the somewhat obnoxious Skip Engblom, but thinking of all the other actors who could have taken the roll, I don't think anyone could have done it better. Even two of the original Zephyr shop boys themselves. Tony Alva & Stacy Peralta, said when Heath came in & did the voice he would use in the film, it was like hearing Skip from the past.

168,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- If you're interested in actor Marlee Matlin, you'll want two questions answered before deciding whether to read her memoir, ""I'll Scream Later"": . Actress Marlee Matlin appears on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" to talk about her sexual abuse. 1. What does she say about her relationship with William Hurt, her former lover and costar in ""Children of a Lesser God,"" for which Matlin won a Golden Globe and an Oscar in 1987? 2. Why does she want to scream? The answer to the first is easy: Yes, yes, good Lord, yes, Matlin can't stop talking about Hurt and their passionate, turbulent, at times violent relationship. For instance, ""We made amazing, mind-blowing love. And we fought."" Good to know. And also, ""No matter what triggered our fights, they were made far worse by his drinking and my drug use."" Got it. Mr. Hurt no doubt sends his regards. The answer to the second is more complicated -- something to do with Matlin's being deaf in a hearing world, and being headstrong and wild, and receiving news of her Oscar nomination while dealing with drug addiction (at the age of 21) at the Betty Ford Center. This memoir, dutifully wrestled into order by L.A. Times film critic Betsy Sharkey, is more ramble than holler, but Matlin clearly enjoys making some noise. EW Grade: C+ .

169,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Masks beneath masks, the click-clack of Mahjong tiles and the sheen of silk cheongsams: Taiwanese director Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; ""Brokeback Mountain"") brings an intoxicating tale of lies, deceit and corruption to the screen with his latest film, ""Lust, Caution"". Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Tang Wei star in Ang Lee's latest film, ""Lust, Caution"" Japanese-occupied Shanghai, 1942. Mrs Mak, an impeccably coiffed Chinese lady, makes a telephone call from a cafe, then sits and waits. Cue a flashback to 1938, where her story begins. Mrs Mak is not the sophisticate she appears -- just a few years earlier, she was shy drama student Wong Chia Chi. Ang Lee's adaptation of Eileen Chang's short story tells the tale of a girl caught up in the winds of change of World War II. The fast-paced erotic thriller tracks Wong Chia Chi's transformation from bookish student to collaborator bait. The film has already received wide acclaim, winning Lee his second Golden Lion at Venice with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film already in the bag. ""Lust, Caution"" cleaned up at Taiwan's Golden Horse awards, scooping seven trophies including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, which went to Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Best Newcomer, for Wei Tang. Wei Tang plays Wong Chia Chi, a student in Hong Kong whose fate is set when she meets Kuang Yu Min (Lee-hom Wang), a handsome fellow student who wants to use drama to provoke his compatriots to rebel against the Japanese. As Kuang's leading lady, Wong Chia Chi blossoms, but when Kuang urges his fellow players to move from inspiration to action, she finds herself at the center of a plot to ensnare and murder Japanese collaborator Mr Yee (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). Dressed in cheongsams and primped and curled to perfection, Wong Chia Chi sets out on the biggest role of her life. As Mrs Mak, she gains Lee's trust through his wife, and the plot progresses as planned until an unexpectedly fatal twist spurs her to flee. Cut to Shanghai three years later: Wong Chia Chi is caught in a listless existence when Kuang unexpectedly re-enters her life. He lures her back into the unfinished sting operation, and before long she and Mr Lee, now head of the collaborationist secret service, are engaged in a torrid affair that pushes her soul and her loyalty to the limit. Newcomer Wei Tang gives a startlingly assured and subtle performance. At times, she seems to mirror Wong Chia Chi's transformation into Mrs Mak from dowdy student to rouged mistress, but she rises to the challenge and ably carries the film on her slender shoulders. As she is thrust into the spotlight by Kuang, stripped mechanically of her virginity in readiness for her role as temptress, and placed alongside Mr Lee, Wei Tang, with serene stillness, lets Wong Chia Chi be swept along to her final destiny. Every diamond demands the right setting to sparkle, and Tony Leung Chiu Wai's generous performance as the enigmatic Mr Lee lets his co-star shine. Leung is pitch-perfect, and shows his quality as he lets Lee's beautifully impassive mask shift and slip, revealing a tightly-wound coil of repressed emotion beneath. Leung is remarkable: a highly skilled actor capable of expressing a world of emotion in the smallest muscle movement. The audience is left to imagine the horrors he unleashes during his interrogations of Chinese resistance fighters. The already-infamous sex scenes can appear a little clumsy and contorted at times, less intimate than acrobatic; it's when Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Wei Tang sit in silence that they most project how intimate and electric their connection really is. The lead characters are ably supported by a stirling cast, most notably a splendidly nuanced performance from Joan Chen as Mrs Lee, forced to turn a blind eye to her husband's affairs, both in business and of the heart, while Asian pop superstar Wang Leehom gives a convincing and impassioned performance as romantic, ruthless Kuang. As for the ambience, Ang Lee is known for his attention to detail, and at times the 30s luxe and glamour is perhaps a little too perfect, a little too glossy, with a depth of style usually reserved for more placid period pieces. (Note for fashionistas: while ""Atonement"" might inspire a 2008 trend for bias-cut 30s dresses, ""Lust, Caution"" will add perfectly formed cloche hats and cocktail rings to the mix.) But this chilling, thrilling film-noir-inspired tale is both poised and elegant, bloody and erotic; if not quite a diamond the size of a quail's egg, ""Lust, Caution"" is certainly a precious pearl of a movie.

170,"(AOL Autos) -- It had never been done before, but as Monte Perlin gunned the engine of his Harley motorbike and prepared to land it in an open boxcar of a moving train, he was strangely calm. Stuntman Monte Perlin putting his motorcycle through its paces. Rather than fret for his own life, he was thinking about the responsibility he had for the life of the woman sitting on the saddle behind him. He laughs to tell the story now, but his moving-train stunt for Disney's 2008 Adam Sandler vehicle ""Bedtime Stories"" was perhaps the most dangerous Perlin's attempted in his 25 years in Hollywood. His career has involved many films, including ""Spider-Man,"" ""Star Trek, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and portraying Arnold Schwarzenegger's stunt double in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" That's right: Monte Perlin is a stunt man. In fact, he said that after completing that train stunt, which involved probably more math than we'd care to compute (consider a man jumping 70 feet on a motorbike at 60 mph from a ramp into an open car of a train traveling at 45 mph, all with a woman on the seat next to him...sounds a bit like a SAT question, doesn't it?) the footage showed he missed. In actuality, he came too close -- or about 6 inches -- to one of the boxcar's doors. So, he had to do it again. ""I have to time it with a girl on my back,"" Perlin said. ""Too short, I'm dead. Too late, I'm dead. Too high, fast or powerful, I take my head off. It had to be perfect. While he didn't sleep for two nights before the stunt, he says a strange type of calm precedes any of his attempts at a difficult trick. Then, just before launch, he says, as he revs the engine of whichever ""boss hog"" he's riding that day, his adrenaline kicks into gear. ""I get that feeling, that I could wrestle 10 gorillas, I could jump 10 trains, and boom! I go for it."" Perlin completed the stunt, this time ""hitting"" it almost exactly through the middle of the box-car's open gate and the movie's production team wrapped the scene. ""I did it again and just hit it perfect,"" he said. ""I hit the impossible stunt."" It didn't start this way . Perlin grew up in Lake Arrowhead, not far from Hollywood, where from the age of 10 he ripped around the largely rural area on motocross bikes before he graduated onto some seriously heavy machinery -- including his own super-modified Harley Davidson that packs a 350 Chevy car engine. That gave him a perfect start in his chosen career of motorcycle stunt riding. AOL Autos: Fastest coupes under $30k . He got into Hollywood by ditching the small-town naysayers who didn't believe in him, he says, and traveling to Los Angeles. After a couple misfires, he looked into a stunt school he found in a Hollywood trade publication and he found his calling. AOL Autos: Top 10 best car commercials . Perhaps more importantly, Perlin met his wife, also a stuntwoman. ""(She) changed my life and stopped my drinking,"" he said. ""I told her, 'If we're gonna get married, I gotta have a career.'"" In addition to traveling to Africa, Israel, Russia, and all over the world, the couple raised four kids on a 10-acre ranch about 25 miles north of Hollywood in Lancaster. Perlin hasn't touched a drop of alcohol in nearly 25 years. He says he often takes his grandkids for ""wheelies"" around his neighborhood. As it turns out, stuntin' runs in the family: His 17-year-old daughter is a champion horse show-jumper and is gunning for an Olympic place, but is already a professional stuntwoman. AOL Autos: Ford's 'Wonder Woman' engineers important new car . Stunt work isn't something to be taken lightly, though. Perlin has the scars to prove it. He says he's broken ""almost everything."" Everything, according to Perlin, includes both of his arms, legs, knees, feet, ankles, several of his ribs, his back and his pelvis. But, his background in gymnastics has left him some flexibility. AOL Autos: Most common car- related injuries . Perhaps philosophically, Perlin points out that the most important thing for any stuntman, alongside having a particular niche or forte like motorbike riding, is learning from the mistakes you'll inevitably make. Sometimes this means knowing when to say no and, simply, when to go for it. He recalls the time he was cajoled by a director into doing a motorcycle stunt he considered too dangerous. ""The worst thing (I ever did) was on a Brian Bosworth series 13 years ago in Florida. I had to jump off a pier, over the water and into a barge. Well, usually they give you a lighter bike mocked up to look like a Harley, but they wouldn't do that (for) this so I had to get a stock Kawasaki 1200 Vulcan. I could jump a 35-foot distance (on that bike) but from pier to barge was now more than 35 feet. I checked the tide and the jump was 40 feet long. ""Now (I know) I don't want to do it. But the production manager came running out and said, 'If Monte Perlin doesn't do this jump, you all are going home right now.' He was really throwing it at me. I did the jump and landed perfectly, but the bike snapped in half and crushed my ankle. In the hospital, the 'doc said they were gonna have to cut my foot off."" Perlin's foot was saved by steel plates and screws, but not before he learned an important lesson: ""It's not the fact of making mistakes in life, it's what you learn from them."" He describes a later stunt where he had to jump a motorbike down 2.5 stories from a roof, jumping through a window, all while wearing a rubber monster suit. He says the lights were bad, and he ""couldn't see a thing."" ""I called down to floor, said I couldn't see the ground,"" he said. ""They said 'You wimp, my mother could do that.' But, five minutes later the lights were right, and I landed it. The end result was I had learned from my mistakes. There are ways to get around anything."" One tough assignment . Most famously, perhaps, Perlin portrayed Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Terminator 3,"" a role that still has a special place in his memory (although he says he's back working with his old Terminator team on a ""major blockbuster"" to be filmed this summer). AOL Autos: Top 10 movie car chases . ""For Terminator 3, I got a call to double Arnold, to go in and meet him. We hung out for six months, riding together and training. Now (as a double for the) Terminator, I can't be riding and looking, or turning my head. I had to use peripheral vision for all my stunts."" Not that he needed a reminder, but Monte's Terminator experiences proved once again that stunt work is serious business. ""In one of the sequences, Arnold's riding on a motorcycle and the lady's on a crane. She swings at him and he grabs the crane. But that transfer was not as sweet as it looked. Riding at 45 mph, following the crane, a harness was supposed to bring me closer to the crane and lock me safe to it. But, the crane made a swerve and it pulled me off the motorbike, and he's still going. Picture a fish on the end of a hook, being swung around. If that timing was off I would (have been) wrapped around a pole and torn in half."" On the same shoot, Monte had to do battle with an object much larger than him and perhaps less forgiving than a moving crane. ""For an explosion shot in the movie, I was heading right toward a tanker,"" he said. ""I swerved around (it) and was head on with a remotely controlled ambulance, (which was) on fire. If I had fallen and it would of hit me, I would have been bone dead. ""But, it landed beside me -- a full-weight paramedic truck flipping through the air. I talked to the guy on the remote control after that. He said it would have landed on top of me, but on the last second it turned to the right and missed me. It woulda squished me."" Unless you're Monte Perlin, do not try this at home. You might get squished.",0.59303594,5981
171,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- You are about to meet Mr. Brown. David Mann and Tamela Mann -- a real-life couple -- star in ""Meet the Browns"" as father and daughter. He's David Mann, star of the TBS sitcom ""Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns."" To borrow a phrase from the network's marketing -- he's very funny. Mann's character -- ""Downtown"" Leroy Brown -- is a lovable, sometimes outrageous and always off-the-wall senior citizen who has stolen every scene he's entered in Tyler Perry's plays, movies and TV shows. Mr. Brown no longer has to steal scenes, because TBS -- owned by CNN parent company Time Warner -- has ordered 80 episodes of half-hour comedy, based on the success of 10 pilot episodes. ""Just in case I'm dreaming, don't pinch me,"" said Mann. ""I'm living the dream."" ""Meet the Browns"" is a spinoff of Perry's ""House of Payne,"" a sitcom that has yielded strong cable ratings for TBS, and it employs some of the same characters seen in Perry's movies and stage plays -- including a play and film named ""Meet the Browns,"" which is only mildly related to the TV series. The show focuses on Mr. Brown and his daughter Cora, played by Mann's real-life wife, Tamela Mann, as Mr. Brown tries to turn his house into a home for the elderly. Those who have followed Perry's productions know that Cora was the conceived during a brief fling between Brown and Madea, Perry's female alter ego. ""If it hadn't been for Cora, Mr. Brown and Madea probably would have killed each other by now,"" Mann said. ""Cora is the glue to this whole thing. Cora keeps everybody grounded."" Mann said Mr. Brown's speech and mannerisms are from a combination of people. ""Grandfathers, uncles, relatives, you know, different friends you see."" he said. ""I use to go to a nursing home and just look at people, watch -- 'OK, that's how they're doing this.' "" His biggest laughs come from his use -- or abuse -- of the English language which Mann refers to as ""Mr. Brownisms."" Manipulate becomes ""manipudip,"" while hypnotize transforms to ""hepatitis."" ""You hear them as I spit them out, and it's just like, 'What was I thinking?' "" Mann said. Mr. Brown's wardrobe, which is always two sizes too small for his protruding belly, is a bright-colored mix of thrift store specials. ""The clothes just kind of happened,"" he said. ""Because, you know, you have that uncle or that relative in your family who just can't let the clothes go?"" Since Mr. Brown originated on the stage -- in Perry productions -- Mann had to adjust to the small screen. ""I'm very animated and so I just had to make sure I toned that down for the screen because I'm so used to making sure that the person in the front row can see as well as the person in the balcony,"" he said. ""To bring that and condense it down for television was a transition for me."" Camera operators are challenged to keep up with Mann as he moves around the set, sometimes re-writing the script. ""One word can trigger a whole different thing with us, and that's what I love about working with Tyler Perry,"" Mann said. ""He gives you the freedom to go in there and create. If you see something that can make it funnier, he gives you the liberty to go ahead and do it, create it and make it funny."" Perry directs every episode at his new Atlanta studio on a sound stage next to where he also tapes ""House of Payne."" Mr. Brown never seems too far from Mr. Mann. In mid-interview, he emerges. ""Oh, he can come out any time,"" Mann, speaking as Brown, said. ""All you got tuh do is say it, and he'll come. Yeap, Mr. Brown is always 'round somewhere. You jes' got tuh belieeeeeve."" The character is played about 30 years older than Mann, which causes some confusion out of costume and in public, he said. ""What's funny is when people see me out they're like, 'Are you Mr. Brown's son?' No, I'm Mr. Brown,"" he said. ""But that's good for the makeup team."" Perhaps the most awkward time is when he is on the set, dressed as Mr. Brown, and he wants to show his wife, Tamela Mann, some husbandly affection. ""She is like, 'When you put that makeup on, you are Mr. Brown, you're not my husband.' "" he said. ""So, she doesn't want me kissing on her and stuff. She says 'it's like a dirty old man kissing and hugging on me.' "" You can also see Mr. Brown in ""Tyler Perry's Madea Goes To Jail,"" which hit theaters last month and has been a rousing success at the box office. ""They finally got Madea,"" Mann said.

172,"BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) -- You know you've arrived at Bengies Drive-In Theatre when you first see the giant movie marquee, announcing the features showing that weekend. Each letter has to be placed and adjusted by hand, as it did when the theater first opened. Bengies Drive-In Theatre has been owned by the same family since it opened in 1956. ""As far as the operation of the drive-in goes, I'm kind of a die-hard. I try to make it run the way it did, to bring a little bit back of the '50s. ... the integrity and the innocence of that age,"" says Bengies owner D. Edward Vogel, who claims to have the largest outdoor movie screen in the country at 52 feet by 120 feet. Vogel has spent most of his life trying to maintain the feel and charm of the Baltimore, Maryland, drive-in movie theater that his family opened in 1956. Vogel wants moviegoers to have the same experience as he did when he went to his family's outdoor theater as a child, although he knows that people today have many more entertainment options. ""Sometimes I'm actually taken aback with the amount of children that are fascinated with this,"" says Vogel. ""Thinking of what their options are, with modern devices and videos and all that, that they are so taken aback . with what happens here."" Vogel started learning, at age 9, the secrets of running a movie theater from his father, Jack Vogel. He has worked tirelessly since to maintain the theater as it was in its glory days. Vogel even operates the same machines that he did as a child; the projection room is filled with the original projectors, which Vogel cleans and cares for each night. And for each movie, threading the film is a complex process far removed from the simplicity of inserting a DVD into the player that we know today. Once threaded, the film spins around as each frame follows an intricate path from the tray, to the projector, until it is shown on the gigantic screen.  Watch the drive-in come to life » . The scene immediately invokes a feeling of nostalgia, reminding us why they were called ""motion pictures"" way back when. Yet, Vogel is quick to tell you that keeping the 53-year-old business alive hasn't always been easy. At Bengies, each night is a double feature, so guests can see at least two movies for $8 a person. Vogel estimates that Bengies makes 60 percent of its revenue from ticket sales, and the rest comes from concession purchases. There's a strict ""no outside food"" policy, and he's open about the fact that the food sales help keep the business open. The waterfront property would be more profitable as condos, he says, and his father planned to build them before Vogel took over the theater in the 1980s. He was only able to avoid closing by cutting costs and staff. ""My parents had a union operator in the booth, they had a manager, they had a concessionaire. I am all of those things, so that has changed,"" Vogel says. Vogel even acts as the host. Known only as ""the voice"" to his audiences, he starts each night by using the theater's speaker system to welcome everyone to his venue. ""When you see the sun setting, and the shadow being cast on that screen, no matter what has happened during that day, good, bad or indifferent, I become a different person when I turn the microphone on."" Besides the challenges of being a small business owner, Vogel's efforts to maintain the integrity of the movie-going experience is challenged by another intrusion of this modern world -- light pollution. Between car headlights and brightly lit businesses nearby, a once-dark sky is now polluted with obtrusive light. Bengies asks that drivers turn their headlights off when entering the grounds of the theater. But over the years, it has been the outside light from other businesses that bleeds into the surrounding sky, making the giant screen hard to see. For solutions to such predicaments, Vogel turns to the owners of other drive-in theaters that have managed to survive since the 1930s. He is an active member of a drive-in theater owners association and is working with other owners across the country to support each other. ""They would all have easier lives if they opened Laundromats in the right location, but they don't. They endeavor; there is a passion about it,"" Vogel says. It is a passion that his audience seems to appreciate. As the sun lowers in the sky and eventually sets behind the screen, the ticket booth is opened on a Sunday night in autumn. People make the trip to the last drive-in theater in the Baltimore area. They set up their chairs, and some sit in their classic cars to enjoy the show. It's an experience Vogel hopes to keep around for generations to come.",0.5888175,6697
173,"(CNN) -- ""Don't close your eyes, don't close your eyes,"" a terrified Christopher Gamez chanted as he coasted 7,000 feet above South Padre Island, Texas, his heart racing. One by one, Gamez watched as three people were ""sucked"" out of the plane and whipped violently into the thrashing winds and mist. ""Just put your head back and breathe,"" he told himself, seconds before joining the others. But why would someone with a severe fear of heights willingly plummet from the sky? To cross ""skydiving"" off his mental bucket list, of course. Gamez was inspired to dream up his list of goals after watching MTV's ""The Buried Life"", a reality TV show about four friends who set out to accomplish the tasks on their joint bucket list. The show, which wrapped its first season in March, has motivated many young adults to create such lists right now, rather than waiting until they're about to ""kick the bucket"" like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman's terminally ill characters in ""The Bucket List"" or Queen Latifah's supposedly terminally ill character in ""Last Holiday."" Gamez said he tuned in every week, but he knew he wanted to live his own version of ""The Buried Life"" five minutes in to the first episode. ""If you had one day to live, what would you do?"" a voice asks viewers during the show's opening credits. ""Would you climb a mountain? Would you kiss the girl of your dreams? Would you tell someone how you feel? Now, if you had a whole lifetime to live, would you lose that drive, or would your list just keep getting longer?"" ""[The guys on the show] inspired me and they pushed me to [go skydiving],"" he said. ""To see them go out with no fear and do the things they wanted to do -- it made me want to do those things, too."" The show's title was inspired by a 19th century Matthew Arnold poem by the same name. The stars on the show -- Ben, Dave, Duncan and Jonnie -- decided ""The Buried Life"" summed up their concerns about getting bogged down with daily routine and losing their passion for life. ""What do you want to do before you die?"" became the premise for their new lifestyle and, eventually, the MTV series that allowed them to cross Number 53 off their bucket list: ""Make a badass TV show."" That list is under their control. ""What they do and how they do it and who they contact and help -- that's their decision,"" said Brent Haynes, a senior vice president at MTV, who first realized the project's potential when he saw footage of the guys sneaking into the Video Music Awards to walk the red carpet. Rather than arresting them, we gave them a TV show, Haynes joked. Others like the guys' ideas. ""The more I watch 'The Buried Life' and the more I've seen them experience things, the more I've wanted to do it,"" Megan Fulton said. The 18-year-old Emory University student said she appreciates what the guys stand for. In 2008, Fulton's friend died about three days after being diagnosed with an infection. The loss prompted Fulton and her friends to create a bucket list made up of kind gestures, long-term goals, personal achievements and travel destinations. Some of the items, like pay for someone's groceries and adopt a dog from a shelter, were crossed off rather quickly, she said. But goals like start a flash mob, travel to Lebanon -- from where Fulton and her sister were adopted -- and overcome her crippling stage fright, will be more difficult to accomplish. ""If they can take part in a Krump [dance] competition, I think I can get up and say a few lines in front of people,"" she said. ""They've really helped me and they don't even know it."" One of Fulton's favorite aspects of the show is that every time the cast members cross something off their bucket list, they help a stranger accomplish one of his or her own goals. For example, in the series finale, the guys help a young man who was adopted at birth find his biological father. Because Fulton was adopted, the episode meant a lot to her, she said. ""You can actually care about people and still be cool,"" Fulton said. ""[It's] a good trend to have caught on."" Just one bucket list wasn't enough for 21-year-old Kevin Cheaney. The Michigan State University student wrote two -- one for specific goals he wanted to accomplish during 2010 and one for long-term goals. Like Fulton, Cheaney was inspired to write a bucket list after his friend died suddenly in a motorcycle accident last summer. ""It opened up my eyes,"" he said. ""Life is kind of short."" Though Cheaney hasn't yet found the time to be someone's hero, save someone's life or race Germany's legendary Nürburgring track, just writing the lists is an accomplishment, he said. ""A lot of these things, like taking more pictures and visiting old friends, aren't going to be difficult,"" Cheaney said. ""They're just going to improve me as a person and make me appreciate life more and really enjoy it to the max."" Celestine Chua, who has never seen the TV series, came across the bucket list concept while surfing the Internet in 2009. The 25-year-old from Singapore eventually decided to write her own bucket list, which she shares with the public on her Web site as a reminder to ""live every moment to the fullest when you're in good health."" Despite already opening her own school for personal development in Singapore and starting an online talk show, Chua said she thinks No. 14, ""experience true love,"" will be the most challenging goal to accomplish. ""You might think [a bucket list is] just a list of goals, but if you're really thinking about things you want to see, experience and feel before you die, then the whole concept of setting goals is totally different,"" Chua said. ""When we start thinking about what we want to do before we die, our goals become totally different. Fall in love, see the Empire State building. That's the magic of the bucket list -- it removes limits."" Gamez agrees. That's why he's not ending his ""buried life"" with skydiving, which he said he would do again in a heartbeat, by the way. Bungee jumping and riding a bull are next. ""I'm hooked,"" he said.",0.5881104,9818
174,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Thirty-eight years ago, Joseph McGinty Nichol was a boy in Kalamazoo, Michigan, playing with toy robots. Many of the robots in ""Terminator Salvation"" are real machines, which increased realism, the cast says. Today ""McG,"" as he is better known, builds and blows up real robots. The prominent filmmaker is the driving force behind one of the season's summer blockbusters, ""Terminator Salvation,"" which is filled with very expensive and very explosive robots. The choice to use real robots when possible, instead of CGI (computer generated images), was deliberate, McG said. According to the director and the film's stars, the decision to use real machines was a testament to the growing sophistication of the moviegoing public, whom they believe can ""feel"" the difference between actors standing in front of a green screen versus actors interacting with the real thing. It was also done in honor of the legendary special effects supervisor, four-time Oscar winner Stan Winston (""Jurassic Park,"" the other ""Terminator"" films), who passed away during filming last year.  Watch the robots in action » . The director and three of his cast members -- Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard and Anton Yelchin -- took a time out with CNN to explain why gravity and singed eyebrows both played a role in ""Terminator Salvation."" Bryce Dallas Howard: That was something that was really important to McG ...  when an audience member sees this film, that they can actually feel what's occurring. I think that audiences are very savvy now. We can feel when something is CGI and that's no disrespect to CGI -- we couldn't do this movie without it -- but, whenever possible, in the tradition of Sam Winston, he wanted to build the robots. So a lot of what you see is real. McG: And if you drop something, we've spent our whole lives watching physics in play, and if you say, just have the CGI do that, people can tell something's off, and it releases you from being involved in the picture. So, we built all the robots, we built all the sets, we blew them up for real, a great many of us lost our eyebrows! Christian Bale: It was kind of comical at times because something that's meant to be so intimidating was actually surrounded by five guys with these kind of puppet rods I had to blank out or I would start laughing. But, the end result is something really formidable and you know, really iconic in movie history. Anton Yelchin: Now I'm obsessed with the robots! I'm so [annoyed] that this guy or whoever it is that's in charge of it wouldn't let me have one!",0.5879773,5389
176,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- ""Whip It!"" suggests what might have happened if Juno had gone to a high school as poky as Napoleon Dynamite's and decided that although her mother wanted her to be a beauty queen like Little Miss Sunshine, she'd rather just strap on roller skates. Ellen Page plays roller derby competitor Babe Ruthless in ""Whip It!"" Only here the petite, droll, feisty, Ellen Page-like heroine played by Ellen Page is named Bliss. And her idea of sass while chatting up a cute rocker (Landon Pigg) in this desexualized, slow-speed grrrl-power sports fantasy is ""I'm Bliss, but I could change that."" Bliss does change her name, at least at the Roller Derby rink. She sneaks away from her square parents (Marcia Gay Harden as the U.S. Postal Service's least likely mail carrier and Daniel Stern as a nice schlub who likes beer) to roll with a sisterly Austin team who call themselves the Hurl Scouts. There, she dubs herself Babe Ruthless, making up in speed what she lacks in muscled aggression. She's heck on wheels, or so we are asked to believe: The rink footage is pretty un-whippy. Even Juliette Lewis, playing the film's designated bad girl and Bliss/Babe's nemesis on the rink, is more of a cute bee-yotch than a real threat. The movie is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut (she also plays fellow Hurl Scout Smashley Simpson), and it's clear she's more attuned to grrrlishness than real athletic power: Smashley is the first to scream ''Food fight!'' and the 34-year-old actress leads the charge in kidlike mayhem.

178,"(CNN) -- Everything you know about the world of Arnold Schwarzenegger's most famous character has changed. Thomas Dekker, Lena Headey and Summer Glau star in ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles."" In the season finale of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" John Connor, the boy destined to lead humanity's battle against Armageddon, gets jolted into the future -- the one he was supposed to lead. But here, he has no identity. No one has heard of him. In this new future, he'll be fighting alongside his father, his uncle and a girl who looks just like the robot he came into the future to save. None of them has any idea who he is. Confused? Don't be. It was a daring, surprising, brilliant cliffhanger for a show that's gained a loyal following, particularly among people like me who are in awe of it. It also opens the door to anyone who hasn't discovered this show yet, allowing for a fresh start. Unfortunately, it may be too late. For fans, the big question is whether the ""Chronicles"" will be back, or canceled for inadequate ratings. We find out in a couple of weeks when Fox announces its schedule. The speculation online doesn't look good. Ending on this Season 2 cliffhanger would be a shame. When Fox picked up this ""Terminator,"" it took on one of the most successful sci-fi franchises in modern entertainment history. It courted ""Terminator"" fans, as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep, high-quality TV storytelling. Ending on this ""what happens now"" cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise's history. But of bigger concern, of course, is that ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last. And that's thanks to Josh Friedman, the inspired executive producer. For him, ""Terminator"" isn't about special effects and metal monsters. It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost. Without clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified. It's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in? Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real-life battle against cancer. Fans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah (Lena Headey) in the new reality. Did she follow her son into the future? If not, what happened to her? Friedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now. He packs episodes with twists you don't see coming but make sense in retrospect. He changes up his style, drops lead characters for entire episodes, uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that's simultaneously believable and eloquent. He lets major characters die. And the show's directors coax subtle, nuanced performances from the actors. You wouldn't guess any of this from Fox's promotions, which have focused too heavily on Cameron (Summer Glau), the robot who helps protect John Connor (Thomas Dekker), sending the signal that it's a show just for teenage fanboys. Cameron and John's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize: the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life. It's in some ways the reverse of ""Buffy."" Speaking of which, Fox may have done better promoting ""Chronicles"" as a family drama and then pairing it with one, rather than ""Dollhouse,"" the latest from ""Buffy"" creator Joss Whedon. (Insider question for fans: Is Josh Friedman the new Joss Whedon? Weigh in here or here.) It's also not clear how, or if, the new movie ""Terminator: Salvation"" affects the show's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines, there's apparently no overlap and no conflict. The weekly adventures of Sarah and John Connor just aren't done. There's too much unanswered, too much left to explore. So here's my pitch to network heads: You can still change the future. Don't terminate these ""Chronicles"" before their time. What are your thoughts? Think Josh is right -- or misguided? Weigh in at Facebook or Twitter.",0.5862001,4222
179,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- This month on the Screening Room we're turning to the wonderful world of animated films. ""Shrek the Third,"" the latest in Dreamworks' inverted-fairytale franchise . Blockbusters like ""Finding Nemo"" and Dreamworks' franchise ""Shrek"" have turned animation into a multi-billion-dollar industry, and a market once dominated by Disney is becoming crowded with competition. This year, Pixar celebrates its 20th anniversary. From ""Toy Story"" to ""Ratatouille,"" the company has transformed expectations about what's possible with animated film. Pixar's position as a world leader in animated film is largely down to John Lasseter - considered by some to be the Walt Disney for a new generation. From ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life"" to ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Cars,"" the Pixar back-catalogue is a testament to his creative genius. And when Pixar merged with Disney he became one of the most powerful players in the movie business. The first Pixar production released since the merger is ""Ratatouille,"" the story of an unlikely alliance between a blundering trainee chef and a gourmet-loving rat. ""Ratatouille"" director Brad Bird's credits for Pixar include the Oscar-winning feature ""The Incredibles,"" which won critical plaudits for its ground-breaking animation. He told CNN, ""I think that one of the nice things about Pixar is that they don't feel like they have discovered the secret formula to making a good movie. They just keep focused on trying to make a movie that they would want to see. We are challenged and surprised every time they work out."" But while Pixar and Disney may be the giants of animation they face formidable competition from another box-office monster -- Shrek. The adventures of the world's favorite ogre have generated a total of two billion dollars in takings. Actor Mike Myers, who voices Shrek, told CNN that he thinks the movies' appeal is their unlikely hero. He said, ""With 'Shrek,' they took fairytales and turned them on their heads. Everything is inverted. Traditional villains are heroes, traditional heroes are villains. The whole team decided, we're going to look at somebody who has been told he was a villain and we're going to make him a hero. That's when I knew they were on to something."" The success of the Shrek franchise, supported by other big budget features such as ""Madagascar,"" has cemented Dreamworks' position as a major force in the animated world. Another successful franchise -- ""Ice Age"" -- has been a hot seller for 20th Century Fox. And the polar climate has also been kind to Warner Brothers with last year's Oscar-winning ""Happy Feet"" charming audiences around the world with a tale of dancing penguins, while the Tom Hanks-voiced ""The Polar Express"" also scored well on its way to becoming a seasonal stocking-filler on DVD. The life-like motion-capture technique used in ""The Polar Express"" will also feature in Warner's forthcoming release, ""Beowulf"" featuring Angelina Jolie. But in a market dominated by 3-D CGI animations, one of the big three summer blockbusters this year belongs to a more traditional form of the art. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is the world's longest-running animated television series, and fans have eagerly awaited its move to the big screen. Creator Matt Groening told the Screening Room, ""We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years. We've had kids, they've grown up, they've become adults, they've become writers for the Simpsons, so we had to do a movie after all this time."" So, will Springfield's most famous inhabitants break all former animation records? Groening and co. will certainly be hoping that the movie gets a box-office ""Woo hoo!"" from its fans. ""Happy Feet"" is a Warner Bros. film; Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner. E-mail to a friend .",0.5855829,1748
180,"(CNN) -- When ""La Bamba"" hit movie screens in 1987, audiences flocked to see the true story of singer Ritchie Valens, who died as a teen in an airplane crash almost three decades earlier. ""La Bamba"" starred Lou Diamond Phillips as singer Ritchie Valens. It's one of 40 films featured in the festival. But it was memorable for another reason. The film was the first box office hit directed by a Latino filmmaker and starring mostly Latino actors, said Chon Noriega, a professor of cinema and media studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""La Bamba"" is part of the Latino Images in Film festival, which begins Tuesday and runs through May on Turner Classic Movies. The event features 40 films that show how Latinos have been depicted on the big screen and is part of the network's ""Race and Hollywood"" series. (Turner Classic Movies, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) Noriega, who chose the films and also co-hosts the festival, talked with CNN.com about what he hopes viewers will take away from the movie line-up.  Watch clips from some of the classic films » . The following is a edited version of that interview. CNN: What was your selection process? Chon Noriega: I decided I was going to focus specifically on Hollywood films that look substantively at either Latino characters or the Latino community. I came up with a master list of films, and it's only about 70. There really haven't been that many that have dealt explicitly with the Latino population. And then, from there, we looked at what was available. CNN: When you talk about Latino images, who do you include in that description? Noriega: It's a kind of pan-ethnic, multiracial category. But basically in terms of the series, what it reflects is Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. There really haven't been, as far as I can tell, many Hollywood films that go beyond those three major groups. CNN: What do you hope to accomplish with this movie lineup? Noriega: By and large, these are films that really haven't been seen since their original release. We really don't have an idea of what the history has been in terms of how Hollywood has dealt with or represented what is now a pretty sizeable part of our population. We have an idea of what the stereotypes have been in terms of the kind of expendable characters that emerge within Westerns or action films, background characters like maids. CNN: What do you mean by expendable characters? Noriega: If I'm watching a science-fiction film and there happens to be a Latino character, I know that that character is going to be the first one to die. (laughs) It is almost inevitable. Or in a Western. They're really not there as characters; they're there as foils for the largely white characters that are defining the film and the story. To my mind, it's valuable just to go back and just see that these are the films that at different points represent how not just Hollywood but our society was trying to figure out where Latinos fit within the national culture. CNN: As people watch these movies, from very early Hollywood to the 1990s, what is the progression of Latino characters? Noriega: I don't know that we see a single trajectory of going from either one thing to another or from bad to better. You see certain recurring figures or types. You see different versions of the gangster kind of morphing into the gang member. But it's more or less an urban outlaw type, and that persists. I think you see little shifts in terms of when they're being made and who is making them. You have some of the same characters in ""My Family/Mi Familia,"" but it's being made by a Chicano filmmaker as part of an attempt to show a very diverse view of what a family can be. CNN: What's your take on white actors playing Latino characters? Noriega: Actually, [co-host] Robert Osborne and I kind of went back and forth on that throughout the series because I think there are two views. One is: Actors are actors, and they play make-believe, and they pretend to be different types of characters, and in an ideal world, actors should be able to play anything they are able to do effectively. But when you look at it sociologically, you see it's only working one way, and that's where I think there's a problem. In the history of Hollywood, we're maybe able to identify 70 films that really focus on Latino characters, family or community, and a third of those have white actors playing the Latinos. And Latino actors are not really getting the same opportunity to play other types. CNN: How did the industry try to ""transform"" actors into Latino characters? Noriega: The Latino population -- and it's part of the irony of this -- it's not a racial group. It's a multiracial, multi-ethnic group. We talk about that in terms of ""West Side Story,"" where everybody's identified how Natalie Wood was in brownface playing a Puerto Rican. But in 1980, there was a revival of it on Broadway, and they actually cast a Puerto Rican actress. In the makeup room, they started putting brownface on her, [because] she wasn't dark enough to meet the expectations of what a Latina character would look like on stage. I've done focus groups with Latino actors in the Screen Actors Guild, and they continually talk about that there are these expectations of what a Latino character is going to look like and more often than not, Latino actors don't look like that. (laughs) CNN: What do you think about how Latinos are portrayed in film today? Noriega: We have a somewhat broader cohort of actors who are known, who are included in films, not always starring, but they get secondary roles in films and so there's in some sense more of a presence. When you look at the statistics in terms of the overall presence of Latinos in film and television, the numbers really haven't changed that much. So it's a kind of a subtle shift.",0.58555603,3837

CNN traveled to Emeryville, California -- the site of the famous Pixar campus -- and sat down with actor Ed Asner, who lends his voice to Carl; technical director Steve May; and co-director Pete Docter to get behind The Scene. Ed Asner: Well, the first 10-15 minutes, that's a grabber. Nobody can resist it. Steve May: Even though we have a cartoony world, you are trying to make the audience believe that the world and the characters exist. The biggest challenges were a flying house that flies underneath a big canopy of balloons. So, if we can kind of capture that on the computer and animate our balloons to look believable too, then the audience will believe that the house can fly. Pete Docter: There is an amazing group of computer scientists that really approach these things both as an artist but also as a scientist. May: You have thousands of balloons that all interact with each other, and all the balloons have strings, so this is a very complex animation problem. Docter: They think about the physics of the balloons. They bump into each other, they can turn wind up or down so they can dynamically move, and then you get the strings that attach those balloons to the house. It's a fairly complex mathematical problem. We tried to make things more like a window you look into, opposed to things coming out at you. May: And then when Russell is on the front porch of the house and you look down and see how far down it is, the audience is scared. Docter: This one I really feel close to, and weirdly, even though it's a film about a 70-year-old man who floats his house away, I feel it's a really personal film.",0.58523375,4972
182,"(CNN) -- ""New Moon,"" the latest film in ""The Twilight Saga"" is doing record business at the box office. In its opening weekend the film grossed $140.7 million -- more than any other film with an autumn release in history. The tales of teenage vampire love based on the best-selling books by Stephanie Meyer have wooed film-goers without having to resort to acres of flesh being on display. This distinct lack of on-screen sex runs contrary to the popular trend of portraying teenagers on screen as playing fast and loose with their virginity and affections. Love and the importance of relationships most definitely rule in ""The Twilight Saga"" and the formula is proving popular with audiences. Elizabeth Morowitz, Communications Professor at the University of Missouri and author of ""Bitten By Twilight"" thinks that this more sensitive approach is the key to the film's success. ""A lot of people ask 'what's so appealing about the Twilight and why is it popular now?' and we think it's because of the relationships and the messages about love in Twilight. In a more conservative environment we've had this push for abstinence education, so we now have a media message that's more congruent with that. So perhaps some teens relate to it in that way,"" Morowitz told CNN's Katie Walmsley. The director of ""New Moon"" Chris Weitz says that sexual abstinence is central to the film's appeal. ""It's not that they can't have sex, they choose not to and I think there's so much popular culture that's saying to young people: 'you'll be cool if you have sex' or 'it's important to be sexy' whereas this series really concentrates on matters of the heart and spirit and I think that's lovely,"" Weitz told CNN. A dashing male lead, in the shape of Robert Pattison doesn't hurt either when you're trying to attract a female teenage audience. But whatever the exact recipe for its undoubted success it looks like teenagers in the ""Twilight"" world don't like to bite off more than they can chew.",0.58437526,9869
183,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It was one of the greatest humanitarian acts in history. Pondering an imaginary Yiddish-speaking place produced ""The Yiddish Policemen's Union,"" says Michael Chabon. At the beginning of World War II, as the Nazis tightened their grip on Europe, the U.S. government allowed millions of Jews to resettle from their homes in Poland and Russia to southeastern Alaska, along the panhandle.   Two million Jews had died at the hands of the Nazi scourge, but millions more were saved as the Federal District of Sitka, Alaska, became the new Jewish homeland -- all the more important when the fledgling State of Israel went down to defeat in 1948. However, 60 years later, Sitka is about to be returned to local jurisdiction, and the island's Jews -- including a noted detective, Meyer Landsman -- are wondering where to go next. The Jewish people, forever rootless, will have to wander some more. Landsman's got other problems, too. He's rootless himself, biding his time in a seedy hotel. There's the body that turned up in a nearby room, a onetime chess prodigy who appears to have major connections with some big shots -- machers, in the local Yiddish lingo. There's his ex-wife, now his boss -- at least until the department is disbanded -- and his partner, a half-Jewish, half-Tlingit named Berko who's far more responsible than Landsman. And there are a host of old enemies with long memories, particularly when Landsman decides to root around the dead chess player's case. Landsman's world is fiction, of course, a product of Michael Chabon's imagination. Chabon's new book, ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" (HarperCollins), combines Landsman's hard-boiled detective's terrain with the landscape of alternate history, one in which world events take a startling turn. The story is rooted in fact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Chabon (""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"") observes. Chabon had written an article about the decline of Yiddish, and the reaction to the piece -- some of it very negative -- ""got me thinking about ... a possible, but nonexistent, imaginary Yiddish-speaking place in the modern world,"" he says in an interview at CNN Center. In the article, he noted an actual plan by Franklin Roosevelt's Interior secretary, Harold Ickes, to create a refuge for European Jews in Alaska, still 20 years from statehood. In reality, the plan was squelched thanks to the opposition of Alaska delegate Anthony Dimond, but in the ""Yiddish Policemen's"" world, Dimond is conveniently killed off and the plan goes forward. Chabon's Federal District of Sitka is a land of tall apartment blocks and grimy streets, as if ""Hong Kong had moved to the other side of the Pacific Ocean,"" he says. The novel is peppered with clever conceits. The book's black hats, as in villains, are actual ""black hats,"" a slang term for ultra-Orthodox Jews. The characters are fond of Filipino doughnuts, a twist on the Jewish taste for Chinese food. The place names of Russian Alaska are an apt companion to the Eastern European surnames of Chabon's Jews, and then there are throwaway bits -- such as in the Sitka of 2001, Orson Welles did release a version of ""Heart of Darkness."" Doing a genre novel -- or several at once, as ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" is part detective story, part alt-history, part modern Jewish folktale -- isn't considered the natural turf for a so-called literary writer like Chabon, but the author -- who has been vocal in support of genre fiction -- makes no apologies for the work. ""I only ever try to write in genres that I love ... I love hard-boiled detective novels, I love fantasy, I love science fiction,"" he says. ""It feels like a natural impulse to want to integrate that passion that I have as a reader into my writing. I didn't see a good reason not to. ... And to say that there's something inherently inferior about the mystery genre is just silly."" In writing ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union,"" Chabon says, the key was re-reading Raymond Chandler, creator of L.A. detective Philip Marlowe and a distinctive tough-guy style, as well as the Russian-Jewish short story writer Isaac Babel, ""whose use of simile and metaphor strangely echoed Chandler,"" he says. Babel also had a ""clear-eyed view of violence. ... There's a kinship there between Chandler and Babel, and that's what helped me kind-of forge the voice for this novel,"" Chabon says. But, he adds, ""the whole novel is itself a simile. It's setting up a series of semblances and mirrorings of the world we live in, so it seemed almost necessary, not just from a stylistic point of view but from a thematic point of view."" Chabon's layered themes include reason's conflict with religious extremism, an idea that comes to the fore as the novel progresses. Holding a mirror to our world is a common theme of alternate histories, and Chabon says he is fond of the type in general. The noted comic-book fan -- he co-wrote ""Spider-Man 2"" -- cites two favorites: the ""what-if"" scenarios often proposed in the Superman comics, and an issue of National Lampoon that celebrated John F. Kennedy's fifth inaugural with the cover line, ""JFK's First 6,000 Days."" ""I read and re-read that a dozen times,"" he says. ""It had an undertone of poignance. ... It was like a perpetual November 21, 1963. America never went through any of the turbulence of the '60s. ... It was the opposite of most counterfactual fiction, which tends to present the catastrophic -- what if the bad things happened. ... This was presenting an 'if only,' not a 'what if.' "" Which is not to say ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" is presenting a better -- or worse -- future. There is a darkness in the book, Chabon observes. But there's also the idea that millions of people were saved from the death camps. ""I'm certainly not presenting the world of this novel as 'it would have been better this way.' It's a dark world, and the Jews of Sitka are on the brink of the abyss,"" he says. ""But there is a certain 'if only' quality."" ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" has earned mostly admiring reviews. "" 'The Yiddish Policemen's Union' builds upon the achievement of 'Kavalier & Clay,' "" wrote the notoriously hard-to-please Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times. Reaction from the public has been positive and even put him on The New York Times' hardcover bestseller list, a rarified place for any author. ""I feel like the book has been embraced,"" says Chabon. Perhaps the only people concerned about the book's subject matter are some Jews, who have asked Chabon if the book isn't, well, ""too Jewish."" ""It reminds me of when my first novel, 'The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,' came out ... and everybody in Pittsburgh said, 'Are you crazy? Why would you set a novel in Pittsburgh? Who's going to want to read a novel about Pittsburgh?' "" he laughs. ""The reason we read fiction is know what it would be like to really be someone else. ... That kind of transport across time and place is the magic of fiction."" E-mail to a friend .",0.58390284,7331

186,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It's the year 2000, and Eric Olsen is a medieval knight sheathed in armor with sword in hand. Tracey and Mac Carlson were married in January after meeting at the 2006 Dragon*Con. The 27-year-old is waiting in a line at Dragon*Con, an annual science fiction costume and convention extravaganza that appeals to comic book nerds, horror movie buffs and anyone with a liking for the fantasy side of pop culture. He spots a red-headed princess in a blue ball gown, reminiscent of a Walt Disney fairy-tale, about 15 feet behind him. She is stunning. Is she single? Will she talk to me? What do I say? By the time Olsen rationalizes his jittery thoughts, he has already asked the princess, Sandra Frazer, 19, out to breakfast. Forget about the drunken bar scene or painful blind dates. As Dragon*Con concludes this week, some single attendees are finding themselves coupled with someone who understands their passion for science fiction and fantasy.  Watch Dragon*Con participants talk romance » . When Olsen and Frazer finished their first date, the seeds of love had already been planted. They dated long distance for a year before Olsen proposed the following year at a Dragon*Con costume competition. Frazer, in a leather Catwoman jumpsuit, accepted the ring. ""I've never cared about football or any of the normal guy stuff,"" said Olsen, a home health care director who enjoys obscure sci-fi television shows and elaborate costuming. ""I met someone who shared my same geeky interests, and that's hard to find."" Pat Henry, chairman for Dragon*Con, said his staff sees romances blossom at the convention each year. Hundreds of proposals have occurred at the event since it began two decades ago. Requests roll in by phone several times a month from couples eager to hold their weddings at Dragon*Con, their meeting place. Share your sci-fi convention love story with CNN.com . The likelihood of finding a partner who enjoys alien movies or X-men comics isn't bad: Dragon*Con has evolved from a small gathering of a few thousand participants to a legendary event that reels in about 35,000 people from all over the world. It's one of the largest science fiction, fantasy and cult media conventions in the world. ""The chances are in favor of the females,"" joked Henry, who noted the convention participants are mostly men, though the number of female participants has increased over the years. ""The other thing is if you marry a geek, you know you can keep them at home with the latest science fiction books or video games."" The convention -- four days of panels, events and parties -- offers bountiful opportunities to let the singles mingle. It's an adult playpen where geekiness is revered. The panels debate the science of Michael Crichton books and dissect the ""Star Wars"" scripts. Parties include a Buffy Prom for fans of the 1990s Joss Whedon television teen drama ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the Miss Klingon Empire Beauty pageant themed after ""Star Trek"". Perhaps the best-known event is the Dragon*Con parade, a Halloween party for grownups, some of whom have spent the entire year preparing their costumes. At this year's spectacle, a gray Saturday morning was lit up by a colorful throng of fairies with pink wings, elves in spandex, pirates in corsets and Jedi soldiers flashing lightsabers. What better way to strike up a conversation than while people are watching together? ""You can't settle,"" said Dragon*Con attendee Dino Andrade, who created Soulgeek.com, a dating Web site for fantasy convention attendees and sci-fi nerds. ""You can't be with somebody who's going to hope that someday you're going to grow out of this."" Three years ago at Dragon*Con, Tracey Carlson was smoking outside one morning in her Batman pajamas when her future husband approached her. During their first dinner date at the convention, the two slipped into a deep discussion about ""Babylon 5,"" a sci-fi television series by J. Michael Straczynski. ""I've had friends set me up with total strangers, but it's hard to keep the conversation going if the person isn't into what you are,"" said husband Mac Carlson. They were married in January and their reception cake depicted Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" one of Tracey Carlson's favorite movies. But romance at Dragon*Con can be short-lived and have downsides, said Kelly Rowles, a 25-year-old from Pennsylvania who runs a blog called Convention Fans. Attending her fifth Dragon*Con this year, Rowles has noticed the convention is more likely to produce hookups than serious relationships, and some participants meet compatible singles who live hundreds of miles away. Accountant Petrona Zickgraf, 43, of New Jersey, understands the long distance challenge. She met her boyfriend at a movie screening at Dragon*Con last year, and he lives 250 miles from her in Virginia. They visit each other regularly to share their affinity for science fiction, but they also share other interests such as hiking and visiting museums. ""Let's just say one of us will move soon,"" said Zickgraf, who was outfitted as comic book heroine Vampirella in a revealing pleather jumpsuit. She and her boyfriend, arms wrapped around each other, were celebrating their one-year anniversary at Dragon*Con this weekend. Sometimes, all it takes to meet your soul mate is the right rooming situation. Katie Marcinkowski, a high school English teacher from New York, attended for the first time last year because she enjoyed science fiction novels. She filed a request for roommates on a Dragon*Con LiveJournal Web page, a popular choice among attendees who want to save money by splitting a hotel room. Assigned to her room was 23-year-old Kellan Potts of Tennessee, who has since become her boyfriend. They share a fondness for ""Torchwood,"" a British sci-fi show about extraterrestrials. ""You don't meet the kind of people who like the same kind of stuff out in the real world,"" said Marcinkowski, dressed in a suede warrior woman costume and holding hands with her boyfriend at the convention this year.

187,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the saying goes, ""Pain is temporary, film is forever"" and noone in the movie business knows this better than stuntmen. Stunt double Terry Leonard performs a hazardous jump from horseback to a truck as Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Hollywood's athletes regularly defy death in pursuit of ever more extreme spectacles to keep us on the edge our cinema seats. ""The Screening Room"" takes a look at some of the best stunts ever pulled off -- and a few that didn't end so well. Don't agree with the list? Think we've missed one? Tell us in the SoundOff box below. 1. ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" (Charles Reisner, 1928) Stunt: Building falls down  Stuntman: Buster Keaton . Charlie Chaplin may be better remembered, but no early stuntman was more willing to risk eternal oblivion for a great stunt than Keaton. In perhaps his most perfect stunt, the side of a building crashes down on top of him and Keaton is saved only by an open window that fits neatly around him. The window was built to have clearance of two inches around each shoulder and on the top of his head. As Keaton himself said, ""You don't do these things twice."" 2. ""Stagecoach"" (John Ford, 1939)   Stunt: High speed stagecoach jump  Stuntman: Yakima Canutt . Ex-rodeo cowboy Yakima Canutt was probably the first celebrity stuntman, best known as a stunt double for John Wayne. In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach. He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach, is shot, falls, and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach. 3. ""Ben Hur"" (William Wyler, 1959)  Stunt: Chariot race Stuntman: Joe Canutt . Canutt (son of Yakima) doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race. Half way through, things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot. When his charito hits, Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot, where he clings before clambering back on. The sequence was completely unplanned but made it into the film because Canutt kept a cool head even though he was injured. 4. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (Stephen Spielberg, 1981)   Stunt: Truck drag  Stuntman: Terry Leonard . This intense stunt sequence was so hazardous to perform that veteran stuntman Terry Leonard only agreed to do it if his friend and fellow stuntman Glenn H. Randall Jr. was driving the truck. A ditch was dug underneath the path of the truck to give Leonard enough room to manoeuver. Harrison Ford, an accomplished stuntman in his own right, performed an earlier portion of the sequence, where Indy hung onto the bonnet of the truck only by a bending hood ornament. 5. ""GoldenEye"" (Martin Campbell, 1995)   Stunt: 750 foot bungee jump  Stuntman: Wayne Michaels . This breathtaking Bond stunt was performed at the Verzasca hydro-electric dam in Switzerland and done in one take. Michaels jumped from a specially-constructed platform built to jut out from the dam to prevent him making contact with the front of the dam, which was studded with steel pegs. This, combined with his high falling velocity, could have proved fatal. 6. ""Who am I?"" (Wo shi shei) (Jackie Chan, 1998) Stunt: 21-storey slide  Stuntman: Jackie Chan . It's almost impossible to choose just one of Chan's stunts, but his faintly slapstick 21-storey slide down the side of a skyscraper is pretty impressive -- even more so when you find out he did it without a harness. He never uses stunt doubles or special effects and as a result has broken just about every bone in his body over the years. Now that's commitment. 7. ""Sharky's Machine"" (Burt Reynolds, 1981)   Stunt: Free-fall jump  Stuntman: Dar Robinson . At 220 feet, legendary stuntman Dar Robinson's jump from Atlanta's Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel remains the highest free-fall stunt ever performed from a building for a commercially-released film. Ironically, despite it being a record-breaking fall, moviegoers only see the briefest moment of the actual stunt in the film. The rest of the fall from the skyscraper is disappointingly a dummy. 8. ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (George Roy Hill, 1969) Stunt: Cliff Leap  Stuntmen: Mickey Gilbert/Howard Curtis . Trapped by the Superposse, Butch and Sundance leap from the top of a cliff into the boiling waters of a river below. It's set up nicely with some humorous dialogue: ""I can't swim."" ""Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill you!"" Robert Redford and Paul Newman did jump off the cliff, but landed on a ledge with a mattress about six feet below. The stuntmen jumped off a construction crane at a studio lot obscured by a painting of the cliffs. 9. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (James Cameron, 1991)  Stunt: Motorcycle jump  Stuntman: Peter Kent . Stuntman Peter Kent's resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger was the basis of a 14-year association with the ex-action hero. As Schwarzenegger's stunt double he performed the T-101's famous motorbike jump into a massive storm drain. To get the effect, his motorbike was rigged up to a web of one-inch cables, to cut the impact when the bike and rider hit the ground. The cables were later digitally erased. 10. ""Deathproof"" (Quentin Tarantino, 2007) Stunt: Car chase on bonnet  Stuntwoman: Zoë Bell . Bell won an award at the Oscars of the stunt world, the Taurus stunt awards, for this daredevil action piece. She clings precariously to the bonnet of a car going at 85 miles per hour while receiving hits from a second car in a long, climactic chase scene. Bell is a stuntwoman by trade but it's easy to see why Tarantino flouted the unspoken Hollywood convention that stuntmen stay out of the limelight and cast her as the film's lead. And five tragic stunts that didn't come off ... Stunts are a dangerous business, and it doesn't always work out. We pay tribute to five brave stunt men and women who fell in the line of duty. 1. ""Top Gun"" (Tony Scott,1986) Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl died during the making of ""Top Gun"" in 1985 after his plane never recovered from a flat spin and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. 2. ""The Crow"" (Alex Proyas,1994) Martial arts legend Bruce Lee's son Brandon was shot and killed during a stunt shooting sequence, when the cap of a blank accidentally penetrated his abdomen and lodged in his spine. 3. ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" (Joe Dante/John Landis, 1983) Actor Vic Morrow and child actors Renee Chen and My-ca Dinh Le were instantly killed when a special-effects explosion caused a helicopter to spin out of control and crash down on top of them. 4. ""Cannonball Run"" (Hal Needham, 1981) Stuntwoman Heidi Von Beltz was paralysed from the neck down when her sports car crashed head on into a van during a stunt on the set of the film. 5. ""Armour of God"" (Jackie Chan, 1987) Chan fell 15 feet while jumping from a wall to a tree branch. He landed hard on his head, causing part of his skull to crack and lodge in his brain. He required major surgery and now has a permanent hole in his head which is filled by a plastic plug.",0.58002025,4632
188,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Is there a filmmaker in the world with worse luck than Terry Gilliam? He was directing Heath Ledger in ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,"" when the actor died -- and it's not the first time he has lost a leading man. Is there a filmmaker in the world with worse luck than Terry Gilliam? Jean Rochefort didn't die eight years ago, but Gilliam had to abandon ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" after a few days when 70-year-old star Rochefort became seriously ill and a flash flood washed away the entire set. The whole fiasco is captured in the documentary ""Lost in La Mancha."" But the animator-turned-director who made his name with the surreal opening sequences of ""Monty Python"" is also known for never giving up. He saved ""Parnassus"" by enlisting the help of Ledger's friends, among them Johnny Depp. He has even resurrected ""Don Quixote,"" which will start shooting next year. The Screening Room talks to ""The Fisher King"" and ""Brazil"" director about Heath Ledger, the Ibiza Film Festival and why he'll never shake off the Monty Python label. The Screening Room: Heath Ledger's death during ""Parnassus"" was tragic, but how did you deal with losing your star in the middle of production? Terry Gilliam: I was just, it's like, now you've got to use your imagination because reality has bitten very hard. And, so, you call your friend Johnny [Depp] and say, ""Heath just died. Can you help me?"" And he says, ""Fine, whatever. Whatever you need. I'll do it."" That's how it started. Then I got Jude [Law] and Colin [Farrell], they came ... the point is that they were all friends of Heath, too. It had to be people that were close to him in order to do what we did. TSR: How do you feel about it now you've had some time to reflect? TG: The experience was awful. That's why we can laugh now. Making films is really hard, and this one was particularly hard. TSR: What is the most rewarding part of making films? TG: I don't know, I mean, you know, writing and coming up with the ideas -- that's the exciting bit. Then it's the slog of just getting through the shoot because there is never enough time . TSR: You are a patron of the Ibiza Film Festival, which is only three years old. How did that come about? TG: The festival of Ibiza approached me a couple of years ago. John Hurt was already a patron, and I know John and I thought that it would be nice. I like being a patron of things, I like patronizing things. And if it's not going to be people, I'll patronize a festival. TSR: Why do you think film festivals are important? TG: The most important thing about them is you get to see films you would never get to see because the distribution system is so dominated by Hollywood. In every country, you get Hollywood movies plus local movies. Beyond that it's very hard. TSR: Tell us about how directing ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" your big feature directing break, came about? TG: With the success of ""Python,"" we decided to make ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and Terry Jones [fellow Monty Python member] and I said, ""Anybody named Terry gets to direct the film,"" and the others foolishly agreed. We directed the film and our names went up as ""directed by,"" and we were film directors. Bingo! Just like that. TSR: ""Monty Python"" was hugely successful, but is the downside that you'll never shake off the label of being an ex-Python? TG: Python is going to be stuck with me 'til I'm dead and probably afterwards. That's what's gonna be on the grave, as well. I know exactly what I'd like put on my gravestone: ""Terry Gilliam. RIP and all that. He giggled in awe."" TSR: What is your film philosophy? TG: All films are learning processes. I am still trying to work out how you make a movie. I didn't study at film school or any of those things. I didn't bother with film theory. Mine is the Mary Poppins theory of film -- a bit of sugar helps the medicine go down. And I have always got medicine I want to give to people. TSR: Which film are you most proud of? TG: ""Brazil"" is the one that will probably be stamped on my grave because that one seemed to have made a big effect on a lot of people. And that's all I'm trying to do is affect people. TSR: What have you learned over the 30-plus years you have been making films? TG: There is no one thing -- it's just going through life. I don't think you ever learn just one thing. At some point you start unlearning things. I have been working hard to unlearn everything I know. TSR: Where are you with ""Don Quixote?"" TG: ""Quixote..."" It's been almost eight years since it fell on its little face. We had been trying to get the script back from the legal entanglement it was in ... and finally pulled that off. I had in those intervening years never read the script because I knew it was the best thing I had ever written. It was perfect -- I finally did it. I got it back and re-read it and have now been busy rewriting it. TSR: What advice would you offer to aspiring filmmakers? TG: Talent is less important in filmmaking than patience. If you really want your films to say something that you hope is unique, then patience and stamina, thick skin and a kind of stupidity, a mule-like stupidity, is what you really need.",0.5789361,5546
189,"(CNN) -- The backdrop to countless movies and television shows, Los Angeles has been reproduced on film more times than any other city on the planet. The L.A. metropolis spreads over nearly 500 square miles. But just like the movie sets that went up in flames last year at Universal Studios, the Tinseltown glamour is often no more than a flimsy facade. Behind the myth of Hollywood lies a swirling melting pot of a place where nearly half of people speak Spanish and where, for every rising star, there's at least a hundred wannabes waiting tables or entertaining tourists on Venice Beach. At once a Lalaland filled with dreamers, Los Angeles has also been scene to some of the worst race riots in American history: a paradoxical place that spawned both Charlie Chaplin and Gangsta Rap. These days, aside from the smog -- an ever present in a city plagued with so many cars and so little rainfall -- the atmosphere is less toxic than two decades ago when the city was awash with crack cocaine and guns.  Watch Wolfgang Puck take CNN on a tour of L.A. » . Schemes to gentrify the downtown and other areas, such as the construction of the Hollywood and Highland complex that includes the Kodak Theater -- home to the Oscars since 2002 -- have gone some way to revitalizing the inner city. In any case, in a city with an estimated population of 3.8 million sprawling over a metropolis nearly 500 square miles in size, it's easy to avoid the sharper edges if you want to. Not that that's so surprising. After all, where better to detune from reality than in a town whose success is entirely founded on our appetite for escapism. And from its world class art galleries to the unashamed schmaltz of Disneyland and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it offers escapism for all tastes. The Los Angeles story started in the late nineteenth century when Midwesterners attracted by the promise of a warm, dry climate followed the railroad west. The boom times risked coming to a premature halt at the turn of the century due to water shortages, but the smart engineering and dark maneuverings of the city water department (maneuverings that helped inspire the classic film noir, Chinatown) resulted in the construction of water aqueducts that ensured the city's continued growth. See pictures of Wolfgang Puck's Los Angeles . In the end though, light was the natural resource that mattered most. From the 1920s onwards, the motion picture industry grew into a worldwide phenomenon thanks to the abundance of clear, blue skies to help light the movie moguls sets. By the time the Golden Age of Hollywood came to an end, the boom town had morphed into a sprawling urban center and the lure of the limelight had earned the city the tag it retains to this day, that of ""entertainment capital of the world."" In the early nineties, the story lost its luster somewhat when years of marginalization suffered by African Americans found a rallying point in the Rodney King beating. Despite a video that appeared to show police violently attacking King, the accused officers were acquitted. The verdict led to rioting in which 53 people died and large areas went up in flames. The city is certainly no angel, it's true. Even so, whether it's tattooed bodybuilders rollerblading Santa Monica Boulevard, a Marilyn Monroe look alike blowing kisses outside Grauman's Chinese Theater or a blood red sunset dropping into the Pacific, Los Angeles is a place with a rare ability to beguile and bemuse in equal measure.",0.5778821,5555
190,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Like all zombie movies, ""Zombieland"" has hundreds of zombies doing awful things, such as attacking and eating humans, but you could argue it's not a zombie movie. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson find themselves battling the undead in ""Zombieland."" Zombie hordes do chase the main characters in a post-apocalyptic world, but the focus is on the comedy's stars, including two Oscar nominees -- Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin -- along with Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone. (Spoiler alert: A third Oscar nominee makes a remarkable cameo appearance, but this story will avoid spoiling the surprise by naming him.) ""We wanted to make a cool, kick-ass road movie about a dysfunctional family traveling across the country and zombies provide us the antagonists, the threat that our characters need to come together,"" said Paul Wernick, who wrote the screenplay with partner Rhett Reese. In fact, Wernick had only seen one zombie film before writing this script. Reese, who is a fan of the genre, kept the story on a track that would feed zombie fans' hunger for blood-and-guts action. ""[The] zombie genre is so well traveled, there is really no reason to get into it unless we could do it in a fresh, different way,"" Reese said. ""We were almost forced to think outside the box to make it an entertaining zombie movie."" ""Zombieland"" is set in the United States months after a fast-moving virus begins turning most people into flesh-eating zombies. A handful of survivors come together to fight back. Wernick and Reese literally rewrote the rules for zombie films in this movie. Eisenberg's character is an obsessive-compulsive man who developed 47 rules -- such as ""fasten your seat belt"" -- designed to help him survive in Zombieland. While Eisenberg journeys to find his parents, he joins Harrelson, a zombie killer who is searching for the last Hostess Twinkie before its expiration date. Stone and Breslin play sisters who survive on their con artist skills. Their goal is to reach a California amusement park, which they think could be free of zombies. The cross-country trip these four characters share resembles ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" -- if written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  Watch the stars of the film talk about zombie fans » . Wernick said they wanted to be ""very freewheeling."" The movie ""gives the audience the thrill of the journey,"" he said. ""We wanted to take some wild turns."" ""The rules that we lived by when writing this is in fact that there are no rules,"" he said. ""Zombieland"" may be to zombies what Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is to Nazis. Wernick and Reese, who have been close friends since high school, often finish each other's sentences as if they were an old married couple. ""When we were trying to get 'Zombieland' off the ground back in the early days, we ..."" Wernick said. ""... assaulted Tarantino at an awards show, to try to get him to read the script,"" Reese said. ""That didn't work out,"" Wernick said in conclusion to their joint thought. ""He thought we were zombies coming after him."" ""Zombieland,"" directed by Rubin Fleischer, offers many of the same elements as a Tarantino film. ""[Tarantino] is all about dialogue, character, irreverence, pop culture and we love all those things over the years,"" Reese said. ""We have always been inspired by him."" The writers had to run through a number of actors before finding the person for the 10-minute cameo. Among them was Patrick Swayze, the writers' first choice. Swayze, who died just two weeks before the movie's release, turned down the role because of ill health earlier this year. Also asked: Joe Pesci, Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Matthew McConaughey, Mark Hamill, Kevin Bacon and Sylvester Stallone. They were asked, but either didn't want the role or were not available, according to Wernick and Reese. With just a few days before filming the scenes, they asked Harrelson to look in his cell phone for names and numbers. He came up with a man who's been an Oscar nominee and Emmy winner. And now, he's got a key role in a zombie film.",0.5776385,7586
192,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Gregory Maguire absently cleans his glasses with his tie as he talks about pushing someone down the stairs. ""I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers,"" Gregory Maguire says. ""I wonder if you've ever stood at the top of the stairs behind someone who's really annoying and just imagined putting your foot out and planting your boot in somebody's objectionable behind?"" he asks. ""You know, I think that thought is a fairly common human thought."" Maybe for the author of ""Wicked,"" who looks more like a college English professor than someone who spends his days writing about the world of Oz. Maguire often imagines evil, and how those without self-control respond to it. Maguire's ""Wicked"" series puts a spin on the classic ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" tale, bringing in corruption, political prisoners and war. His first book, ""Wicked,"" has sold more than 2.5 million copies, and the musical based on the book reportedly has been seen by more than 3.75 million people in New York alone. National tours have been huge successes. Maguire's newest book in the series, ""A Lion Among Men,"" tells the story of the Cowardly Lion -- the motherless cub defended by Elphaba in ""Wicked.""  Watch Maguire roar about ""Lion"" » . CNN talked to Maguire about the book's main character, his life before ""Wicked"" and why he has never written realistic adult fiction. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: To someone who's never read your books before, how would you describe your style? Gregory Maguire: I would describe [my books] as being, not quite allegories, but commentaries on contemporary society -- and indeed politics to some extent -- enshrouded in, and disguised by, the guise of children's stories. In other words, I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers who say this is going to be easy ... and it's going to be fun. And indeed I hope it is fun. But once I get people involved in the plot, I hope to also communicate some of the questions I have about the way we live our lives in the 21st century. CNN: Talk to me about Brrr. What's his personality like? What is he going through? Maguire: Well, Brrr is the name that I've given to the cowardly lion who is the main character -- the protagonist -- in this novel called ""A Lion Among Men."" And I gave him that name for two reasons: One, because it does sound like a shiver, and he is always slightly spooked by the world; and the second reason, because the two letters in it B-r-r-r are both letters from the name of Bert Lahr, who played the Cowardly Lion so famously in the 1939 MGM film. His character arises in the hollow space in our perceptions between that giant roaring lion at the MGM logo ... the ideal lion, and the kind of sad, sacked, out of work, vaudeville performer in lion pajamas that we see when Dorothy actually runs into the lion on the Yellow Brick Road. In other words, there's a huge disconnect between the image we project of ourselves -- the best we might ever hope to possibly be -- and the way we feel about ourselves at our absolute worst -- when we're the most down in the dumps. There's a huge space in between there. So the novel's really in some ways about character and taking control of the destiny of your own character. CNN: Everyone knows of your success with ""Wicked"" -- it's huge. But what was your life like before you wrote that book? Maguire: I had written children's books for 14 years before I published ""Wicked."" And none of them were poorly reviewed, and none of them sold enough for me to be able to buy a bed. I was the traditional artist in the garret, expecting to live that way or maybe to give up writing soon because I would eventually have to get a job that was going to pay me some kind of retirement package. Silly thought, that, these days. CNN: You often take the point of view of the ""wicked"" or ""evil"" characters in your books. How do you get inside their heads? Maguire: Well, I like to think I'm a pretty good-natured guy and pretty civil and probably not ever truly guilty in any serious way of any legal infractions. But I do seem to have an unconscionable, easy time of thinking about how people might do wrong, of what they might feel like and how they might behave if they had less self-control than I do. And then also, how they would have to deal with the weight of being called evil. If everyone was always calling you a bad name, how much of that would you internalize? How much of that would you say, all right, go ahead, I'll be everything that you call me because I have no capacity to change your minds anyway so why bother. By whose standards should I live? In a way, all three of my adult books come down to that question -- by whose standards should I live? Can I find my own standards? Can I recognize them? Can I value them if I can name them? And are they good enough, are they strong enough, standards by which to live? CNN: You talked about writing children's books. How is writing for children different than writing for adults? Maguire: Well, for one thing children are intensely more impatient than adults. So you have to start out active, you have to start out strong and you cannot be, for a moment, self-indulgent. Everything has to be a sound bite or something that the children can visualize as if they're running a little Super 8 projector in their mind. Now I date myself with ancient technology, but you know what I mean ... write the scene that you want Steven Spielberg to film, which means every sentence has to give us something to see. Make it intensely visual and this is, I think, the main rule for writing for children. But in no way do I make it less thoughtful. I just actually have to work harder. Writing for children is like the difference between writing a sonnet and writing a gossip column. I mean you have a lot more restrictions so you have to work a lot harder. I'm not saying that a gossip column can't be intensely rewarding, but I dare say it's easier to write. CNN: Have you ever considered writing anything that's not magical, or more real life? Maguire: I have, but I never seem to get very far. In a way, and I don't mean to talk myself down, but sometimes I look at the mysteries of other people and I think, ""How do I know if they think anything like I think?"" I can only guess who you might be. You might see the world in a whole different range of colors than I do. You might be super sensitive to nuances of body language or music or ... I just don't know. So I always feel when I try to write realistic fiction for adults, that maybe I don't have enough life experience, even though I'm 54. I'm not sure I trust it. But when I write something that has a magic base to it, I put in everything I do know about the infinite varieties and subtleties and ambivalences in adult behavior, but nobody can call me out and say, ""You don't even know who human beings are"" because I've couched it. I suppose it's a kind of safety net for myself, or a security blanket. If I'm writing magic, nobody can say I got it wrong because we all know magic doesn't exist.",0.57738423,4373

Adam Sandler had to cope with more than just falling gumballs in his latest comedy, ""Bedtime Stories.""

196,"(CNN) -- ""Sesame Street"" may not be a real place, but tell that to some of the people Michael Davis met when researching and talking about his new book, ""Street Gang."" Bert, left, and Ernie have been mainstays of ""Sesame Street"" since the beginning. ""I met a lot of people who I worked with in New York or got to know in New York -- transplants -- who said to me, 'When I first arrived here in New York, I had this strange desire to find Sesame Street,' "" he said. Well, to paraphrase the famous theme song, who wouldn't want to get to ""Sesame Street""? For two generations, the fictional block of brownstones inhabited by curious children, friendly adults and some odd-looking Muppets has helped shape childhood education by offering exercises, games and life lessons all wrapped up in a television-friendly format. It's a model that's proved durable and influential, says Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson. ""If I were to make a list of the top 10 most significant American TV shows ... I'd put 'Sesame Street' on the list. The fact that it's still on the air attests to its [significance],"" he said.  See ""Sesame Street"" in pictures » . ""The idea they came up with was kind of radical: If you can sell kids sugared cereal and toys using Madison Avenue techniques, why couldn't you use the same techniques for teaching counting, the alphabet and basic social skills? And it works."" Indeed, as Davis notes in ""Street Gang"" (Viking), the genesis of ""Sesame Street"" was when the 3-year-old daughter of a Carnegie foundation executive was fascinated by television, waking up to watch the broadcast day begin and memorizing commercial jingles. He talked about his daughter with a friend, producer Joan Ganz Cooney. In the liberal ferment of the mid-'60s, both wondered whether educational TV could go beyond the staid classroom shows of the era. Cooney became the driving force of ""Sesame Street."" She put together the plan, helped recruit talent, located financing and oversaw production. ""Sesame Street"" became the foundation for the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop), which created other educational shows such as ""The Electric Company"" and ""3-2-1 Contact."" ""She is just such an impressive woman,"" said Davis, adding that Cooney gave her blessing to his book project without any requirements but one: that he ""get it right."" ""She's just one of those extraordinary public figures."" Cooney didn't hold much back in telling her story to Davis, and neither did others. From its debut on November 10, 1969, the show was a hit -- within a year, it was on the cover of Time magazine -- but it was not without its personality clashes. The original Gordon, Matt Robinson, was a producer uncomfortable in the spotlight. Northern Calloway, who played David, struggled with mental illness. The show's primary songwriters, Joe Raposo and Jeff Moss, were constantly in competition; Raposo ""fairly seethed with envy"" when Moss' ""Rubber Duckie"" hit the Top 20, Davis writes. The book provides balanced biographies of a number of principals, including producer Jon Stone, whom Davis calls ""the heart of the book."" ""I wanted people to say, 'Wow, this guy Jon Stone, he really was the Orson Welles of ""Sesame Street."" ' Without him, the show wouldn't have been what it became,"" Davis said. But for all the backstage machinations that affect any creative enterprise, ""Sesame Street"" stayed true to education, in all its forms. One show matter-of-factly included a breast-feeding Buffy Sainte-Marie; others featured a boy with Down syndrome, Jason Kingsley. EW: Stars who dropped by ""Sesame Street"" Jim Henson, who was famous as creator of the Muppets when ""Sesame Street"" began, invented a world of (literally) colorful characters -- Oscar, Big Bird, the Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie -- and, with his puppeteering crew, gave them soul. And when Mr. Hooper (Will Lee) died, the show dealt with his passing honestly. Over the years, the show has taken its knocks. Critics from the left have complained about its merchandising; critics from the right disliked its avowed commitment to diversity. In the '90s, ""Barney"" stole its thunder, and cable drained its audience. As ""Sesame Street"" comes up on its 40th birthday, some critics wonder whether it's still necessary. But for all that, says Thompson, the show remains important, both in its pioneering educational style and in its clever business model. And it takes its charges seriously, he points out. ""One thing I still like about 'Sesame Street' is that it's not artsy,"" he said. For Davis' part, doing the book -- which succeeded a TV Guide article he did on the show's 35th anniversary -- gave him renewed respect for its creators' achievements. And he's found out through his Web site, http://www.streetgangbook.com/, that ""Sesame Street"" still has the magic to move children -- mothers of autistic children credit the show with helping the kids' development -- and adults. ""Somebody said, 'I was OK when my mom explained to me there was no Santa Claus,' "" he recounts. "" 'But I cried my eyes out the day I realized Kermit was a puppet.' Isn't that great?""",0.5708244,2930

198,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Actor Tim Roth is in an abandoned building near downtown Los Angeles, and he's about to mix things up. British actor Tim Roth plays a human lie detector on the hit series ""Lie to Me."" ""This is a scene where the FBI is interrogating a suspect,"" Roth said. ""I'm breaking into the interrogation to get information out of him using the sort of techniques that my character espouses as opposed to pressuring him."" Roth, who plays Dr. Cal Lightman on the hit Fox series ""Lie to Me,"" is shooting scenes for the season finale, which will air May 13. His character is an expert on body language and the detection of deception. ""Our series is based on the idea that we can read what's going on across your face and if it's contradicting what you're actually saying,"" Roth said. Lightman and his colleague, Dr. Gillian Foster -- played by Kelli Williams -- run ""The Lightman Group."" They observe body language and interpret what it means in order to help law enforcement agencies see through the bull. His character is based on Dr. Paul Ekman, a specialist who reads clues embedded in the human face, body and voice to expose the truth in criminal investigations. Ekman, who in 2001 was named as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century by the American Psychological Association, is a scientific consultant for the show. Roth says Ekman can be intimidating. ""He makes me very, very nervous, Paul, you know,"" he said. ""I mean, he's the sweetest man, as sweet as can be, but when he's around, you feel like your acting is really being judged."" Roth is perhaps best known for his outings with famed director Quentin Tarantino. The British actor pulled off a convincing American accent in the cult classics ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" He uses his true-Brit accent in ""Lie to Me,"" which debuted in January and is one of the season's few successful new dramas. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, critic-at-large Ken Tucker wrote that ""Like 'Monk' and 'Psych' and 'The Mentalist,' 'Lie' offers us an eccentric who's brought in by law enforcement to solve crimes."" Though he gave the show a B-minus, Tucker praised Roth for ""resist[ing] the cuddly/cranky."" The show has quickly found its fan base, though ratings have declined slightly since the show was put in its 8 p.m. Wednesday time slot, ahead of ""American Idol."" (The first five episodes aired after ""Idol."") ""I got stopped because one of my lights was out and I was coming back from work and the guy, the cop that stopped me said 'Oh, we watch your show' and they seemed to enjoy it,"" said Roth. ""ER"" alum Mekhi Phifer is set to join the cast as an FBI agent for two episodes this season, starting Thursday. ""I'm here to kick ass and take names, you know. So it's kind of different,"" Phifer said. ""It's fun, you know. Obviously, I carry a gun and I'm in law enforcement rather than being a doctor."" Phifer particularly likes acting in intense scenes with Roth. ""I have my own way of doing it,"" he said. ""It's a little different than the way Tim does it. It's a lot of fun, and we're having a great time."" And will time spent on the show help Phifer better detect when people are lying to him in real life? ""It's going to take a few more episodes, but I'm pretty perceptive,"" he said. Roth, however, makes no claims of special powers -- at least when he's away from the set. ""I try not to know too much, because it actually is quite extraordinary,"" he says. ""When you watch politicians on TV, you can use the stuff that Paul does to see if they're lying or not.

200,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British filmmaker, screenwriter and playwright, Mike Leigh has been in the movie business for over 35 years. Leigh on screenwriting: ""I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process."" In that time, he has been nominated for five Oscars, as well as winning the Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival for ""Naked"" in 1993, the Palme d'Or there for ""Secrets & Lies"" in 1996 and the Leono d'Oro at Venice Film Festival in 2004 for ""Vera Drake."" Famous for his fierce independence (read refusal to work in Hollywood), Leigh's work is known for gritty realism and a focus on underprivileged sections of British society. Another of Leigh's calling cards is an unconventional approach to screenwriting. ""The Screening Room"" caught up with the veteran director at the International Screenwriters' Festival in the UK earlier this year to ask him more about his approach to making films. The Screening Room: Why is this festival so important to you? Mike Leigh: I am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and I have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together. I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process. TSR: What do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you? ML: I think screenwriters who, because of the politics and economics of the film industry, are forced to work in a much more conventional way, are always fascinated to discuss with me how I work. TSR: There is this romantic idea that screenwriting has to be a painful, solitary experience. That's not what you experience, though. ML: No, I don't sit in a room writing a script solo. My films are highly structured. Everything you see in my films is very precisely written, very thoroughly researched, but actually it is done through rehearsal, it's done through improvisation and research. I work for six months with the actors before we shoot anything, then the shooting of the film is in itself then an operation of making the film as I go along in a way, although it's very structured. It's a very sophisticated thing. TSR: How did you first discover that this way the way you wanted to make your films? ML: I trained as an actor, I did a lot of theatre work and, of course, the convention of actually rehearsing is much more prevalent in the theater, although actually what I do isn't really theater practice, it's very film orientated in its nature but it came out of all of those kind of explorations and experiences in the 1960s. TSR: How important is the audition process for you? ML: For me, casting is probably more important than it is for most people. If someone has written a conventional script then a range of actors could do that role. I find actors with whom I can collaborate to create characters, so I have to have actors that are brilliant, who are very intelligent and not all actors are very intelligent, who are versatile, who are character actors and not all actors are, that have a sense of humor, that have a sense of society and commitment, who aren't just narcissistic which a lot of actors are, and people who are patient and courageous. Working with me on these things is dangerous. TSR: When you work with actors do you give them over to the idea that they are shaping the story, or do you always know exactly what you want? ML: I don't always have a structure, and certainly there is no illusion involved. Also, I say to each actor when asking him or her to take part, you will only ever know what your character knows, so they never have an overview of the film. Their actual contribution is as an individual with a responsibility to their character, but my job is to tell the story. It's a very healthy and harmonious division of labor, but certainly, there would be no point in doing it if I didn't set up conditions in which they can really explore and the thing can go in fantastically unpredictable directions. TSR: When you take a script to a producer, how much should you compromise to get the film made? ML: I am the least qualified person in the world to answer that because I don't do that in the first place. I mean, I go to backers with my producers and we say, ""I can't tell you anything about it. I haven't got the script. Give us the money and we will go away and make it."" And they either say 'yes,' which happens just occasionally, or they say 'no' which happens most of the time. So, I never have a situation where anybody interferes or where I have to compromise. But just in passing I would say that I have a rule about what one should do in the film business which is never compromise.",0.56823444,1378

202,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Smoking in youth-rated movies has not declined despite a pledge two years ago by Hollywood studios to encourage producers to show less ""gratuitous smoking,"" according to an anti-smoking group. The American Medical Association Alliance has been trying to get movie studios to make smoking-free films. The American Medical Association Alliance, pointing to research that big-screen smoking leads teens to pick up the tobacco habit, called for an R rating for any movie with smoking scenes. The head of the group that gives U.S. movies their ratings, however, said the smoke has been clearing from youth-rated movies, a result of the film industry's sensitivity to the issue. The alliance, the medical association's advocacy arm, launched a summer campaign this week aimed at publicly shaming studios into making smoke-free films. ""Research has shown that one-third to one-half of all young smokers in the United States can be attributed to smoking these youth see in movies,"" said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, head of the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. Fielding cited another study that he said ""found that adolescents whose favorite movie stars smoked on screen are significantly more likely to be smokers themselves and to have a more accepting attitude toward smoking."" The Motion Picture Association of America, the industry group that issues ratings and parental guidance for U.S. films, added smoking scenes as a factor in ratings two years ago, but Fielding said it has not made a difference. ""In all, 56 percent of the top box office movies with smoking released between May 2007 and May 2009 were youth-rated films -- G, PG or PG-13,"" he said. Joan Graves, who chairs the Motion Picture Association's movie rating committee, offered her own statistics, based on all of the 900 films rated each year, not just the top movies included in Fielding's numbers. The association has given no G ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking, Graves said. Overall, 55 percent of the  movies rated in the past two years showed some smoking, but 75 percent of those with smoking scenes were given R ratings, Graves said. Twenty-one percent were rated PG-13 and the remaining 5 percent were PG, she said. A G movie is deemed suitable for all audiences, while a PG rating is a signal to parents that a film may include some material they might consider inappropriate for children. PG-13 indicates a stronger warning that some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. No one under 17 can be admitted to see an R movie without a parent or guardian. American Medical Association Alliance President Sandi Frost used as her chief example of a movie with ""gratuitous smoking"" this month's blockbuster ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which was rated PG-13 ""for intense sequences of action and violence, and some partial nudity."" ""Millions of children have been exposed to the main star of the film, Hugh Jackman, with a cigar in his mouth in various scenes,"" Frost said. ""I'm willing to bet that not one child would have enjoyed that movie or Mr. Jackman's performance any less if he hadn't been smoking."" A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox, the studio responsible for the Wolverine movie series, said Jackman's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes. In one scene, the cigar is shot out of his mouth, prompting Jackman's Wolverine character to suggest its loss would lead to clean living -- an anti-smoking statement -- the studio spokesman said. He said that while the Wolverine character has a cigar in his mouth in almost every panel of the comic book series, producers made ""a conscious decision"" to limit the cigar in the movie. The American Medical Association Alliance, hoping to draw studio executives' attention, hired a mobile billboard to drive around the major studios this week. ""The billboard shows a teenage girl asking the question, 'Which movie studios will cause me to smoke this summer?' "" Frost said. The alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count ""how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to G, PG and PG-13 audiences,"" she said. ""At the end of the summer, whichever studio has delivered the most tobacco impressions to youth audiences will be named in a billboard that will run outside of their headquarters,"" she said. Motion Picture Association of America spokeswoman Angela Martinez said the group ""is very sensitive to the concerns of parents about the purpose of the rating systems."" ""It's reflective of society,"" Martinez said. ""It's really a tool for parents to help determine what their kids see."" They began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as ""a reflection of changes in society and health concerns,"" she said. ""Smoking is rated like all the other factors, including violence and sex,"" she said. Fielding said it should be absolute -- and not just a factor. ""Any movie with smoking should be rated R,"" he said. ""And if they worry about an R rating hurting their profits, then they should work with studios to remove smoking from films that hurt youth."" Graves, whose committee makes the decisions, indicated such a zero-tolerance policy would not be accepted.",0.5629002,4842
204,"(InStyle.com) -- Engagement season is in full swing, which, of course, means an influx proposals, but more importantly, tons of creative ""will you marry me?"" scenarios to top. Take a cue from these celebrities by jaunting off to memorable destinations for a proposal your partner won't forget (or turn down!). Venice was the scene of Avril Lavigne and Dereyck Whibley's engagement. St. Barts . On their first date, Billy Joel took Katie Lee out to dinner, but on that November 2002 evening she got much more than a scene from an Italian restaurant. ""Afterward he took me to see ""Movin' Out"" [the hit musical based on Joel's tunes], got onstage and sang the last two songs,"" recalls Lee, 23, who was visiting New York from Ohio and first met Joel, 55, in the lobby of the Peninsula Hotel, where both were staying. ""I knew he was trying to impress me."" It must have worked; six months after that meeting she moved to Long Island, New York, to live with him, and in January 2004 he proposed on a trip to St. Barts. ""He got down on his knee, and it was a complete surprise,"" Lee recalls. ""That made me feel really special."" Though Scott Wolf, 35, of ""Everwood,"" and Kelley Limp, 28, formerly of ""Real World New Orleans,"" credit a friend with setting them up, in a way they can thank Oprah Winfrey. ""When I first called Kelley,"" says Wolf, ""she said, 'I just sat down with strawberries and chocolate milk to watch ""Oprah."" '"" Apparently it was not the best timing. ""Nobody calls me at 4 o'clock,"" says Limp. ""It's an unwritten rule that I'm watching ""Oprah""."" So Wolf decided to catch the episode, and they discussed it afterward. The chatting continued over a dinner date at Raoul's in New York City. A year later, on a trip to St. Barts, Wolf took Limp boating and pulled into a cove for a sunset dinner, where he gave her a Bruce Winston (son of Harry Winston) 2.7-carat diamond ring. ""I said yes, like, 15 times,"" says Limp. New York City . It was Stephanie March's first and last blind date ever. After weeks of delays, March, then starring on ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"", finally agreed to meet Food Network chef Bobby Flay for dinner at Nobu in New York. Within seconds of meeting Flay, her misgivings about blind dates were dispelled. ""I know it's a cliché, but I remember thinking, Oh my gosh, this is the rest of my life,"" says March. She was right: Just before Christmas 2003, Flay took March ice-skating at Rockefeller Center, where he surprised her with another kind of ice -- a princess-cut diamond ring -- and a proposal. Africa . On the golf course during the 2001 British Open was probably the last place Tiger Woods, 28, expected to meet his future wife, Elin Nordegren, 24. The thunderbolt struck when fellow golfer Jesper Parnevik introduced Woods to Nordegren, who was then working as the Parneviks' nanny. If his scores are any indication, Woods was more than a little distracted by the stunning Swedish former model. He lost the tournament but soon won her heart. And on a South African safari two years later, Woods proposed to Nordegren during a sunset stroll around the Shamwari Game Reserve. Nantucket, Massachusetts . Devon Gummersall, 29, thought he'd blown it after a 1998 date with ""Quarterlife's"" Majandra Delfino, 27. ""I showed up in this awful leather jacket, and Majandra was like, 'Who is this guy?'"" recalls Gummersall, the former co-star of ""My So-Called Life."" After losing the leather, he reconnected with Delfino at a concert five years later -- and didn't miss a beat. Soon, the future groom bought a garnet ring from the Beverly Hills Watch Co. and hid it for a scavenger hunt on a Nantucket, Massachusetts, beach. Says Delfino, ""I dug up this white box, all sandy, and opened it. Devon said, 'Do you know what this means?'"" Delfino definitely did. New Zealand . The romance that blossomed between ""Two and a Half Men's"" Melanie Lynskey, 30, and Jimmi Simpson, 31, star of ""The Farnsworth Invention"" on Broadway, surprised them both. The pair, who had become friends while co-starring in a Stephen King miniseries in 2000, were sharing a taxi when ""good night"" turned into a good-night smooch. ""We kissed each other unexpectedly!"" says Lynskey of the moment. ""Once that happened, I was head over heels for him."" Simpson chose a moonlit moment on the deck of Lynskey's family beach house in New Zealand in 2005 to get down on one knee. ""He opened the ring box,"" she recalls, ""but then he set it on the table. I was like, 'Can I try that on?'"" Six months after Matthew Perry introduced them at a 2004 barbecue, actor Jonathan Silverman, 41, proposed to ""Close to Home"" actress Jennifer Finnigan, 28, in a New Zealand rain forest. Hawaii . Channing Tatum surprised his ""Step Up"" costar Jenna Dewan with a weekend proposal in Maui in September 2007. Tatum arranged to have close friends of the couple fly in for the festivities. Canada . When commissioning an engagement ring for his girlfriend Heidi Klum, Seal had one key word for New York City jeweler Lorraine Schwartz: canary. Schwartz's sister delivered the 10-carat yellow diamond stunner to Whistler, British Columbia, where Seal proposed to Klum on a glacier -- with the sunny piece of ice. England . In May 2004 Jason Priestley arranged a trip to London, England, -- to the very street corner where he and girlfriend Naomi Lowde first met. Once there, Priestley presented Lowde with an emerald-cut, three-diamond ring by Steven Pomerantz. ""It became evident that my life was better with Naomi in it,"" says Priestley. In the summer of 2006, after 3 years of dating, ""Superman Return"" star Brandon Routh purchased the 3-carat diamond ring that had caught girlfriend Courtney Ford's eye during an earlier visit to Beverly Hills jeweler Neil Lane. But since the two were traveling for the ""Superman Returns"" press tour, Routh asked Gilbert Adler, one of the film's producers, to hold the ring until they arrived in England. ""Poor man!"" says Routh. ""He carried it around for two and a half weeks."" Finally, while picnicking in Glastonbury, England, Routh popped the question. Italy . One year after Avril Lavigne and Dereyck Whibley's friendship turned romantic, Whibley, 26, proposed with a 5-carat diamond solitaire after a picnic and gondola ride in Venice, Italy. It was something of a shock for the bride-to-be. ""I might look like a tough chick -- and I am,"" Lavigne once said, ""but I'm a hopeless romantic inside."" Puerto Rico . Just two days before Christmas 2007, under a full moon at midnight in a bay off the coast of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter were seated in a double kayak, taking in the bioluminescent organisms shimmering in the water all alone, except for a tour guide in a second kayak. After giving an ""amazing speech,"" Winter pulled out a 4.3-carat brilliant-cut diamond ring by Michael Barin, Sánchez's favorite jeweler. California . ""I can't remember the exact day I knew she was the one; I remember it was an accumulation of what she's about, where she came from, and her family,"" says tennis star Pete Sampras of his bride, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras. After nine months of dating, Sampras proposed to Wilson at his Los Angeles, California, home with a platinum ring with oval-shaped diamond from Cartier. The romance between Noah Wyle, 29, and Tracy Warbin, 31, a movie makeup artist, was born on the frigid Maine set of the 1997 film ""The Myth of Fingerprints."" Recalls Warbin, ""At the end of one shoot, there was a huge snowball fight. Noah pushed my face into a snowbank. It really, really hurt! I knew then that he liked me, because it was so kindergarten-y."" Wyle concurs: ""It's a technique I learned in grade school, and it's worked for me ever since."" Three years later, on Valentine's Day 1999, at a picnic for two on the couple's Santa Ynez, California, ranch, Wyle got down on one knee to propose, a marquise-cut diamond ring in hand. In February 2005 Christina Aguilera and her beau, Jordan Bratman, went on a Valentine's Day getaway to Carmel, California, where Bratman proposed with a five-carat diamond-and-platinum ring by Stephen Webster. Eight months later, the pair -- who share a love of the wine country -- wed in Napa Valley. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2009 Time Inc.

205,"(CNN)  -- Author Frank McCourt, whose tragic childhood became creative grist for his first book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Angela's Ashes,"" died Sunday, according to the Web site of his publisher, Simon & Shuster. He was 78. Frank McCourt won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for ""Angela's Ashes."" McCourt taught creative writing to high school students in New York City for 30 years before achieving literary acclaim with the 1996 biography. ""Angela's Ashes,"" named after his mother, also won the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was translated and sold throughout the world. In the book, McCourt described a desperate childhood marked by severe poverty, malnutrition, neglect, infectious disease and loss. ""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood,"" he wrote. EW: A tribute to Frank McCourt . McCourt wrote the two other memoirs, ""Tis"" and ""Teacher Man,"" as sequels to ""Angela's Ashes,"" and penned the children's book ""Angela and the Baby Jesus."" The author was born to Angela and Malachy McCourt on August 19, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York, to Irish immigrants. The family fled to Limerick, Ireland, four years later, during the Great Depression era, only to become mired in even more gut-wrenching poverty. Three of the couple's seven children died. Malachy McCourt, an alcoholic who managed to keep jobs only a few weeks at a time, left the family scrounging to survive. Yet, he also brought joy to his children, as the younger McCourt wrote in ""Angela's Ashes"": . ""Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, 'Dad, tell us a story,' he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different colour and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go underwater and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes."" In October 2006, McCourt told the BBC that he saw his family's struggles as part of the human experience, without casting his father as a villain. He also expressed sorrow about his mother. ""First of all, I feel so sorry that I didn't understand more about her life and her misery and the deaths of three children,"" McCourt said. ""I had one daughter and if she had a cold, I was up all night. If she had the sniffles, I was running to her little crib or her bed. ... When I was growing up and as I grew to manhood, I really didn't understand my mother's pain."" Asked about his Irish-American identity, McCourt told the BBC: ""I'm actually a New Yorker, because that's what I feel passionately about. ... New York is the place that gets me all excited."" He returned to the United States at 19 and spent decades coming to grips with his youth. ""I dealt with my past, and my future and my present by writing about it. And it's really, it's a gift. I wish everybody had it, because it eases all kinds of distress,"" he told the BBC. McCourt is survived by his wife, Ellen, and other family members, including brother Malachy McCourt, who is an actor and writer.",0.5598536,7275
206,"(CNN) -- When Michele Maro became captivated by ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, she never imagined she would one day be walking around in the Shire, touring Hobbiton and peeking into hobbit holes. Fans of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy can tour a New Zealand farm that was used as the setting for Hobbiton. Those are all fictional places, but fans can visit the closest thing possible in New Zealand, where the trilogy was filmed and where specially designed tours will take visitors to some of the stunning locations featured in the movies. Maro, who lives in St. Petersburg, Florida, spent two weeks in New Zealand in 2003 being guided around forests, national parks and farms, exploring sites that she didn't think were real when she first saw them on the big screen. ""The scenery was so pretty that I thought it had to be computer-generated,"" Maro said. But the place that moved her most was a serene sheep farm in Matamata, New Zealand, where filmmakers brought to life author J.R.R. Tolkien's vision of Hobbiton, the hobbit village where Frodo Baggins lives, complete with hobbit holes peeking out of hill sides. ""I just stood there and cried. It was like, 'I can't believe I'm actually here,' "" Maro said. ""I loved the movie so much, and to actually be there where they filmed that, it overwhelmed me.""  See iReporters' film location photos » . Sing along with 'The Sound of Music' Such passion has prompted tour operators all over the world to take fans to sites that have served as settings for blockbusters on the big and small screens. They can be legendary places recognized on their own or seemingly mundane restaurants, houses and street corners that become instantly recognizable when put in the context of a favorite movie or TV show. In London, England, you can visit locations used in movies such as ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" When in Rome, Italy, world-famous landmarks like the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and the Colosseum will make you feel as if you've stepped right into ""Roman Holiday"" and ""La Dolce Vita."" Tours highlighting sites used during the filming of ""The Sound of Music"" have many visitors singing with joy in Salzburg, Austria. ""The buses were packed. It seemed to be very popular,"" said Kelly Van Baren, a sales manager who lives in suburban Chicago, Illinois. She and her sister watched the musical over and over while growing up, she recalled, and when they visited Munich, Germany, in the fall of 2007, they made a special one-hour train trip to Salzburg just to take one of the tours. It turned out to be an adventure in itself. A convoy of three huge buses with scenes from the film painted on their sides shuttled mostly American tourists to various sites, including the church where the main characters were married and a gazebo featured during some of the musical numbers, Van Baren recalled. Her favorite site was a majestic palace used as the von Trapp family home in some of the exterior shots. The movie was played on the bus during the tour, and the sightseers were encouraged to sing along, prompting Van Baren to wonder what the locals must think of the visitors. ""It was just hilarious, these three giant buses full of Americans driving around the countryside. It wasn't a proud moment, but it was fun,"" Van Baren said. Big Apple lures fans . Movie and TV fans who want to stay closer to home to explore famous locations have plenty of movie tours to choose from in the United States. New York, which has served as the backdrop for countless films and television shows, offers a wide variety of sites. Seeing them in person for the first time can be shocking, tour operators say. ""Guests are definitely surprised by the appearance of the locations,"" said Pauline Gacanja, public relations and marketing assistant for On Location Tours. ""On TV, things generally look larger and more dramatic than they really are."" The company takes about 100,000 visitors a year to dozens of well-known sites around the city by bus, by water taxi or on foot. Buildings used as homes in ""Friends"" and ""The Cosby Show"" are among the most popular places, Gacanja said. Visitors can also see locations such as the diner used in ""Men in Black"" and the firehouse used in ""Ghostbusters,"" according to the company's Web site. But the most popular tour focuses on sites used in the television and big screen hit ""Sex and the City,"" Gacanja said. Fans of ""the Sopranos"" also have their own tour. ""Seinfeld"" aficionados may opt for Kramer's Reality Tour, offered by Kenny ""The Real"" Kramer, the man said to have inspired Jerry's colorful friend Cosmo Kramer. Stops include the Soup Shop that inspired the ""Soup Nazi"" episode and the real Monk's Restaurant, used for the exterior shots of the diner where the characters hung out. This may be the only tour that tempts visitors with highlights such as ""Visit the office building where Elaine worked for Pendant Publishing, Kramer had his coffee table book published and George had sex, on his desk, with the cleaning lady."" Plenty of movie tours also thrive outside New York, in cities such as San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For Maro, the experience in New Zealand was so unforgettable, she went again a year later for another look at ""The Lord of the Rings"" sites. ""My imagination went wild there. It was so fabulous. It was just a great trip,"" she said.",0.5581552,6403
207,"(CNN) -- Norman Ollestad remembers the tree limb. The book's jacket features a picture of a 1-year-old Norman clinging to his father's back on a surfboard. He was 11 years old, riding in a Cessna in a blizzard through California's San Gabriel Mountains in 1979, on his way to pick up a trophy he won in a skiing competition. ""The gray clouds were just pressing against the windows; it didn't even seem like we were moving,"" he recalls. ""Then, there's a limb reaching out of that fog and disappearing. Then another one and another one. ""Then realizing we were in the trees."" The plane crash that followed killed his father and the pilot and badly wounded his father's girlfriend, who with young Norman was tossed violently onto the top of an 8,600-foot mountain in the freezing, February chill. ""I felt three thuds. The third one must have knocked me cold,"" says Ollestad, now 41. ""I remember feeling those thuds in my spine -- a clear memory of that. Then I woke up who knows how long after."" The ensuing nine-hour, life-or-death descent -- in the end, he was the only survivor -- is the topic of ""Crazy for the Storm: A Memoir of Survival.""  Watch the press conference that followed his survival » . But the book is about more than a plane crash, namely his relationship with an adrenaline-junkie father who basked in the wild life of Malibu in the 1970s and relentlessly pushed his ""Boy Wonder"" to excel from the ski slopes of northern California to the crashing surf off the Mexican coast. ""It's actually 100 percent about my relationship with my father,"" Ollestad said. ""That relationship was present on the mountain with me, even though he was dead."" Released this month, the book already has been picked up by Warner Bros. [a sister company of CNN] for a feature film and has earned critical acclaim, including comparisons to John Krakauer's 1997 nonfiction best-seller ""Into Thin Air."" ""An engrossing story of adventure, survival and psychological exploration,"" wrote the journal Kirkus Reviews. In the book, Ollestad cuts back and forth between the crash and journey down the mountain and the years leading up to that moment. Included are memories of life in Malibu, where he grew up the son of divorced parents in a cottage on the beach. There are surfers and skate rats, musicians and nudists and memories of smoking weed and spying on his neighbors' most intimate moments. But mostly there's his father, Norman Ollestad Sr., an athlete, actor, lawyer, musician and former FBI agent. From the age of 3, Norman was groomed for competitive ""extreme sports"" by his father and pushed to be the best. The book's jacket features a picture of a 1-year-old Norman clinging to his father's back as he steers a surfboard atop the waves of California's Topanga State Beach. He acknowledges that many times, when his father was cooking up a new adventure for the two of them, he would rather have been ""riding my bike or eating chocolate cake."" ""[At first] a lot of people are, 'Wow .. I had a lot of trouble with some of the stuff your dad was doing,' "" says Ollestad, who studied creative writing at UCLA and attended UCLA's film school. ""But then it turned out that a lot of that stuff was really beautiful."" And he believes it saved his life. The skiing made him aware of how steep the mountain's slope was and what it would take to get down it without falling. The skiing and surfing gave him control of his body and awareness of the exact movements required to work his way out of the descent's most treacherous spots. ""Some of it was sort of eerily, specifically perfect for the situation,"" he says. ""Forty-five degree pitch, blizzard with ice, well, I've been here for eight years doing this. It was familiar to me."" The book has had another, unexpected result for Ollestad, who now lives in Venice, California. He says he's been shocked at the e-mail from readers. ""Nobody's even written about the plane crash,"" he says. ""[They say] 'it reminds me of some of the things I did with my dad or some of the things I didn't get to do.' ""In every e-mail, whether it's a woman or a man, they talk about ...their relationship with their father or mother. It touches something in there where they want to talk about it."" Now, for Ollestad, the story has followed him all the way around. He's the father of an 8-year-old, Noah, and seeks to walk the line between responsible parenting and teaching his child the lessons he says saved his life. ""Those were different times,"" he tells the boy in the book's epilogue. ""My dad made me do lots of things that I'd get arrested for making you do.""",0.5560115,5565
208,"(CNN) -- That Australia is once again defending itself against claims of racism is not surprising. Harry Connick Jr. gave the comedy skit a zero mark. That the cause of the furor is a childish, inappropriate racial 'joke' is even less of a surprise. Australian popular culture has a long held an often embarrassing tradition of wrapping racism in supposed humor. Movie star and singer Harry Connick Jr. condemned on air an Australian television skit featuring a group of performers who wore blackface to impersonate the late pop star Michael Jackson and his brothers. Connick was a judge on the Australian variety show ""Hey Hey It's Saturday,"" when the blackface group ""Jackson Jive"" performed ""Can You Feel It"" wearing huge black wigs, blackface and one spangled glove each. The Michael Jackson impersonator wore whiteface. In the 1950s a popular song lampooned a 'misfit' Aborigine whose 'boomerang won't come back.' Popular entertainer Rolf Harris was even less sensitive in a verse of his song ""Tie me kangaroo down sport"" proclaiming that on his death one of his friends could free his captive Aborigines: ""Let my Abos go loose, they're of no further use, so let my Abos go loose."" A famous Australian illustrator known as Joliffe made his fame and fortune in a long-running cartoon depicting Aborigines as dim-witted, thick browed, naked, creatures from the stone age. It is not just indigenous Australians who have borne the brunt of these so-called jokes.  Watch Connick's reaction to the 'blackface Jacksons' » . After World War II a new wave of immigrants arrived from southern Europe. Australians unused to such foreigners with odd sounding languages and strange smelling food quickly labeled the new comers 'wogs.' In the 1960s a popular film ""They're A Weird Mob"" mocked one of these immigrants for his poor English and strange customs. He finally wins approval by marrying his boss' daughter, a good Anglo Aussie, learning to swear and drink copious beers. There are just a few quick examples -- there are many, many others -- of how Australians use mockery and humor to disguise their discomfort with so-called 'outsiders.' The use of humor for a long time reflected official government policy that also scorned foreigners and Aborigines. Australian settlement in the 18th century was rooted in racism. Indigenous Australians were deemed not even to exist. British law proclaimed the continent Terra Nullius or empty land, extinguishing in an instant tens of thousands of years of Aboriginal occupation and ownership. Aborigines were dispossessed, often violently, and basic human freedoms, and rights to equal education, employment and welfare benefits denied. It was not until 1967 -- almost 200 years after European settlement -- that the law was changed to officially count Aborigines in the census as human beings and no longer included amongst the flora and fauna! For most of the last century Australia pursued a 'White Australia Policy.' It was designed to limit immigration only to those of white skin. In the first half of the century nearly 80 percent of all immigrants came from the United Kingdom. Despite being geographically in Asia, Australians generally viewed Asian people with suspicion dubbing them the 'yellow peril.' In the words of one of the prime ministers of the time Harold Holt ""Australia must be kept preponderantly British in its institutions and compositions of its people."" Immigrants, Holt conceded, ""offered much"" and in return they must simply ""become Australian."" For many that too often meant being forced to laugh along with jokes at their own expense. Times though, thankfully, have changed. The 'White Australia Policy' has long been consigned to history. Aborigines have struggled for and won a measure of equality of law and opportunity. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd last year apologized to Indigenous Australians for past mistreatment and injustice. Humor too has changed. A new generation of Australian comics from China, Vietnam, Italy, Greece and Lebanon have turned the tables; laughing at themselves and 'Anglo Aussies.' Comedian Joe Dolce scored a worldwide hit with his song 'Shaddap-a-your-face' a ditty spoofing his Italian broken English. A Greek-Australian comedy group filled theatres throughout the country with its play 'Wogs Out of Work.' Humor can be a great leveler. One of Australia's prouder traditions is egalitarianism, a nation where princes and paupers can on a simple human level meet each other as equals. Humor, in the right spirit pricks our pomposity, makes a virtue of our differences and reveals our common humanity. The ham-fisted 'Jackson Jive' routine achieved none of that. Appearing in blackface belongs in Australia's own dark past, back there, with the 'White Australia Policy', silly songs about Aborigines and Joliffe cartoons. Connick was right to give the comedy skit a zero. Connick's homeland America, is itself not free of racial issues, but in this case it took an American to tell those Australians who still find such offensive skits funny: ""The Joke is on you!""",0.54717374,9625
209,"(The Frisky) -- When I try to explain my ardor for HBO's trashy-fabulous soap opera ""True Blood"" to my dude friends, they either shrug and change the topic, or question whether I've been writing for ladyblogs for too long and am suffering from a form of Stockholm Syndrome. Dudes just don't dig bloodsuckers, since vampires pretty much look like girls. We prefer zombies, because we love chainsaws, flamethrowers, and samurai swords. And because, on some level, we know that besides being vehicles for sperm, our other important, if lesser, genetic imperative is to defend our loved ones from hordes of unthinking, flesh-eating metaphors for current social anxieties. To most guys, vampires are the monster movie equivalent of that sensitive man-sponge in college who plays acoustic guitar in order to seduce chicks. They're what you get when you cross your average Renaissance Fair enthusiast with a mosquito. And what's with their greatest weaknesses being most kinds of Italian food, Sunday school, and the sun, which helps flowers grow? Really? Why women find date-rapey parasites who wear capes compelling must have something to do with deeply primal fears. A vampire is a monster, who looks, acts, and talks like a man. Who is passionate, romantic, and tortured. To surrender to this character is to play with fire. The vampire, in many ways, is the prototype of the bad boy. Women love bad boys - they're exciting, and the chance to change him, to break him like a horse, must be an irresistible challenge. If self-destruction weren't seductive on some superficial level, then no one would ever need rehab. But I am like most guys in that I am a fan of zombie flicks. ""28 Days Later"" may possibly be my favorite movie ever. I'm also a fan of alien and robot movies, but more often than not, it seems women are more adept at dispatching those. Zombie movies indulge male power-fulfillment fantasies. We enjoy pretending to be dragon-slaying knights or bad-guy-perforating cowboys or Bruce Willis, saving our ex-wife from a skyscraper full of terrorists. The Frisky: Compliments guys take as insults . Before any feminist blood vessels burst, let me explain that this fantasy goes hand-in-hand with a male-specific fear that speaks to ancient genetic programming. That for all our swagger, testosterone, and machismo, we cannot protect those we love. The disaster call for women and children to evacuate first isn't chivalry, inasmuch as it's evolutionarily smarts. The women and children will continue the species; the men are disposable. We fear being useless, especially once we have issued forth our baby-making essence. The Frisky: Where all the good guys are . In ""True Blood,"" the vampire Bill has decided to change himself, to fight his ferocious nature. He struggles to be a better, um, corpse. He rejects the cold, bloodthirsty vampirism of his peers, and tries to embrace those human virtues he once had: selflessness, mercy, kindness, and justice. In some ways, he's less a vampire and more a superhero. Then he falls in love with someone he is told he shouldn't. And his love for Sookie, a human woman, is a choice he has made, regardless of the scorn heaped upon him by the undead and the living alike. He protects her, despite his fears that he is completely impotent, powerless to defend her from a world that despises them both. And she returns the favor, despite her fears that underneath sweet words and passion is an animal waiting to pounce. A little bit for men and women. The Frisky: Ways men try to impress women . I watch ""True Blood"" because chicks will dig it when I can talk about Eric and Maryann and Action Stackhouse; it's how I ""open"" a pick-up artist-style ""set."" My knowledge of ""True Blood"" will help me convince turbo-hotties to come back to my sweet fourth-floor walk-up in Queens, where I will love them forever, or until I have to call the unemployment office at 10 a.m., whichever comes first. Sigh. Oh forget it. I love this show, without condition. I love that Alan Ball followed up his twee meditation on mortality, ""Six Feet Under,"" with a show that's just about hot sexing and gratuitous gore. It's a soft-core comic book, nothing more, nothing less. I fully accept that there's a part of me that will always be a pear-shaped teenage goth girl. I mean, I'm reading the ""True Blood"" books, for the love of Godric. Horror movies, books, and television shows reflect our collective fears, and ""True Blood"" is awesome because it sneaks male fears into a female-oriented program. Also: because all the women are hot and sometimes they show their chest. TM & © 2009 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved .",0.5468196,7523
210,"(CNN) -- Entering his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter may not be able to see the finishing line, but he knows it's coming. In ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the trail of evil. In ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" the sixth film in the Potter series, he's like a marathon runner who senses that he's got this course beat: He's still pacing himself, but there's a definite spring in his step. Potter's confidence seems to be a product of Daniel Radcliffe's authority in the role as much as anything. He's decided he's the hero of the piece, and he's happy with that; Radcliffe plays him with such implacable conviction and such lightness, it's becoming harder to worry about the character's plight. He can be reckless and impatient, but by now he's essentially untouchable. His chums may be prey to hormonal surges -- buckets of screen time is devoted to Ron's love life and Hermione's lack of same -- but our Harry stays focused. While Ron moons over his girlfriend, every night Potter takes a textbook to bed with him.  Potter 101: A guide to Harry Potter » . This battered book of potions comes with scarily insightful scribbles by a former student, the titular half-blood prince, giving Potter a distinct edge over his classmates and that increasingly conflicted bleached blond, Draco Malfoy. More important, it also gets him in good with this installment's designated dodgy faculty member, Professor Horace Slughorn. We know the drill by now: Slughorn has special knowledge that Harry must prize out of him, while the teacher's own leanings remain tantalizingly ambiguous. A special guest star in all but name, Jim Broadbent plays this mildewed academic with appropriately Dickensian panache and an undertow of sympathy (first spotted disguised as an armchair, the suspiciously solicitous Slughorn maintains at least one foot in the closet). Adapted by Steve Kloves and directed (like Potter V, ""The Order of the Phoenix"") by the efficient, self-effacing David Yates, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is as brisk and nimble as J.K. Rowling's two-steps-forward, one-step-back narrative stratagems allow. It risks annoying some fans by axing one significant character and a potential action show-stopper, but it's actually the overarching storyline that feels skimpy; the movie is replete with lovely, inventive design details and idiosyncratic effects work, while Yates' reluctance to pump up the bombast might be counted sweet relief after the latest bout of blockbusting overkill. iReport.com: ""Potter"" fans review the film . A trio of evenly spaced set-pieces do generate enough excitement to make this an iffy proposition for parents with younger kids; in particular Dumbledore and Harry's climactic cave expedition is an intense, nightmarish standout. But for all this series' constitutional doom-and-gloom, what's truly charming about the Harry Potter movies is the rare privilege of seeing Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione) and the others growing up before our eyes.

211,"(OPRAH.com) -- When the first book of the ""Twilight"" series was released in October 2005, no one could have guessed the phenomenon it would become. Four years later, 70 million copies have been sold worldwide. The books have spent 143 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and the first movie in ""The Twilight Saga"" grossed $380 million at the box office. The story, a love triangle between a vampire, a human and a werewolf, has ignited an international frenzy, and the woman behind it all is 35-year-old author Stephenie Meyer. Once a stay-at-home mom, Stephenie says the idea for ""Twilight"" came to her in a dream. ""It was two people in kind of a little circular meadow with really bright sunlight, and one of them was a beautiful, sparkly boy and one was just a girl who was human and normal, and they were having this conversation. The boy was a vampire, which is so bizarre that I'd be dreaming about vampires, and he was trying to explain to her how much he cared about her and yet at the same time how much he wanted to kill her,"" Stephenie says. ""It really captured my imagination."" That dream became Chapter 13 of ""Twilight."" Oprah.com: Get your Twilight"" primer . Before the night of the dream, Stephenie says she had lost herself a little in the work of motherhood. ""I was really burned out. I really had gotten into that zombie mom way of doing things where I wasn't Stephenie anymore,"" she says. ""[Writing ""Twilight] was a release. That was the dam bursting. I'd been bottling up who I was for so long, I needed an expression."" Though she'd been married for 15 years, Stephenie says she didn't tell her husband at first about her new passion. ""My husband thought I'd gone crazy. I'd barely spoken to him because I had all these things going on in my head, and I wasn't telling him about this weird vampire obsession because I knew he'd freak out and think I'd lost my mind,"" she says. At first, Stephenie was documenting her dream only to make sure she would remember it, she says. ""The dream was just something I was so interested in, and it was so different from what my everyday was at the time,"" she says. ""I just wanted to remember it so badly. That's why I started writing it down -- not because I thought this would be a great story for a novel."" Oprah.com: Read an excerpt from ""Twilight"" Though Stephenie had been an avid reader all her life, she says she was never a writer before ""Twilight."" ""It seems kind of presumptuous to me [to think] anyone else would want to read the things that are in my head,"" she says. ""I didn't think of it [as a book]. I did the dream. And then I wanted to see what would happen with them. It was just me spending time with this fantasy world, and then when it was finished it was like, 'This is long enough to be a book!'"" Before ""Twilight,"" Stephenie says she read every type of book except for horror. ""That was the genre I just knew I was too chicken for,"" she says. ""I read a little bit of everything. ... When I was 8, I was reading ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" and all that, not knowing it wasn't my reading level."" Oprah.com: Gift ideas for every reader on your list . Now that ""Twilight"" is a huge success, it's hard to imagine any literary agent rejecting it. But Stephenie says she'd submitted it to plenty of people before she was signed. ""I got nine rejections, five no answers and then one 'I'd like to read more,'"" she says. Stephenie says it was her sister who really pushed her to keep submitting it to more agents. ""She was the only one in the world who knew what I was doing,"" she says. These days, the ""Twilight""series is more than just a literary hit. The first two movies have also created a stir and catapulted three young stars into the limelight. British actor Robert Pattinson, who plays the lead vampire Edward Cullen, is now an international heartthrob. ""I knew that the problem was going to be Edward, because he's the perfect vampire,"" Stephenie says. ""How do you cast that from your pool of human actors?"" When producers found Robert, Stephenie says it was a perfect fit. ""He's got something about him. He doesn't look like everybody else. There's something unusual,"" she says. ""There are moments where he looks exactly like he did in my head."" Stephenie says casting Bella, the book's protagonist, was a bit easier. ""There's plenty of people who look like the girl next door,"" she says. ""We were really lucky [to cast] Kirsten Stewart, who is a phenomenal actress. I didn't know if we were going to get that caliber."" Though Twi-hards, as fans are called, know most everything about the series, Stephenie says there is one secret she's never revealed before. ""There was a different ending to ""New Moon"" originally,"" she says. ""It was a much quieter book. It was very much all in Bella's head."" Oprah.com: Are you a Twi-hard? Take the quiz! Stephenie says fans have her mother to thank for ""New Moon's"" current dramatic ending. ""My mom's like: 'You know, Stephenie, maybe a little more action at the end would be a good idea.

212,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Flannery O'Connor did not expect to become the subject of a biography. She thought the narrow borders of her life -- lived ""between the house and the chicken yard"" -- wouldn't give a writer much to work with. Author Flannery O'Connor (here with two of her peacocks) remains a subject of fascination for many. It would therefore come as a surprise (and probably secretly please her) to learn she is the focus of at least three. The latest is ""Flannery: A Life of Flannery O'Connor"" (Little, Brown) by Brad Gooch, an exhaustively researched exploration of O'Connor's unlikely journey from shy, sarcastic and ""contrary"" Georgia girl to acerbic literary treasure. That she suffered from lupus and died before the age of 40 is well-known to fans of O'Connor. But Gooch uncovers much that even ardent followers of the author will find revealing, including details of her college career as a cartoonist, and her time in Iowa City at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The book manages to synthesize what seems difficult to reconcile: how such a chaste, religious person could produce stories that are bitingly funny and filled with shocking violence.  Watch O'Connor's fascinating story » . Gooch spoke with CNN about his experience researching the biography. What follows is an edited version of the interview. CNN: When did you first discover Flannery O'Connor? Brad Gooch: I first read her stories in my 20s and loved them, and then a little later, the [collected] letters came up, ""The Habit of Being."" And I'd had a few hunches about her from reading the stories, which were a little mysterious. ... And then when I read the letters, a lot of those hunches seemed true. ... Trying to put the life of this woman together with the stories became as interesting as the stories to me. CNN: She wasn't always known as Flannery O'Connor. Gooch: Her name was Mary Flannery O'Connor, and her mother and everyone in Milledgeville (Georgia), where she lived most of her life, continued to call her Mary Flannery. But when she went to Iowa City -- the Iowa Writers' Workshop -- early on, she decided she wanted to be a writer, and she decided on the name Flannery. She later said, ""Who would want to buy these stories of an Irish washerwoman named Mary O'Connor?"" Partly, I think she wanted to lose the Southern-ness of ""Mary Flannery."" ...  Also, Flannery was a gender-neutral name. ... Her initial rejection letters were actually addressed to ""Mr. Flannery O'Connor,"" and I think she kind of liked that neutrality. CNN: What did you find most remarkable about her? Gooch: I think the discipline of her writing becomes ... almost inspiring. She developed lupus when she was 25, she lived until she was 39. And in that period, she kept up this regimen that she had begun at the Iowa Writers' Workshop of writing every morning for three hours, even if it meant sitting in front of a blank page. ... [Near the end of her life] she was editing her final stories and hiding them under the pillow in the hospital from the doctors so that she could go on. She was still working on her last story after she had last rites. ... All of that is a sort of [a] level of commitment that is startling and unmatched. CNN: Her stories are often funny, yet disturbing. Gooch: Her style goes under these names, like grotesque or gothic, but she was really crossing these two wires of humor and almost this kind of dark theological writing that had never been put together before. ... [In ""A Good Man is Hard to Find""] a family on vacation ... meets someone named the Misfit, this ex-con in the woods. ... And he winds up shooting the entire family while spouting existentialist, nihilist philosophy. And in that story, there's always a point where you keep laughing past this line, and suddenly someone's being shot and you're laughing and then [readers] get very uncomfortable. They can't tell whether this is supposed to be funny or not, and I think that O'Connor definitely works in that territory, where you can't tell if she's being funny or tragic and serious. CNN: The titles of her stories and novels are so wonderful -- ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find,"" ""Everything That Rises Must Converge,"" ""The Life You Save May Be Your Own,"" ""The Violent Bear It Away."" Gooch: ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"" was a Bessie Smith song; ""Everything That Rises Must Converge"" she got from Teilhard de Chardin, a favorite Catholic theologian of hers. You see in a way how sophisticated she was in her approach to her writing. I think sometimes when people read the stories, they confuse O'Connor with the character in her story, and they think she is some Grandma-Moses-crazy-folk-artist, but actually she was an incredibly educated artist who had read everything, including a lot of theology. ... The titles ... are attracting and punchy, but you also see that she's working kind of consciously with these reverberating references. CNN: What do you make of her fascination with birds? Gooch: When she was forced by lupus to move back to the South and live on a dairy farm with her mother in Georgia, one of the first things she did besides getting very serious about working on her stories was to order a peacock. And eventually she had 39 peacocks. ... And I think that she was very conscious that the peacock was this gawky, comic bird. I think she identified with the peacock for that reason. The peacock squawked all night and annoyed people, ate her mother's flowers, and yet, at this certain willful moment, opened its tail and revealed what she called this ""map of the universe."" So, I think it really stood in a way for this kind of transfiguration that would take place for her spiritually but also in the beauty of her writing. ... She definitely made an effort to make the peacock her own personal logo. CNN: What is her literary reputation 45 years after her death? Gooch: She seems to be ever more popular. When she died she was considered almost a minor writer. Her second volume of stories hadn't even come out; her ""Collected Stories"" was published in the early 1970s and got a posthumous National Book Award. It seems that every decade, interest in her grows. When the Library of America put out her collected works 10 years ago, she outsold Faulkner. So she has this popularity and interest. And [she] increasingly shows up in funny pop culture ways. I think in the last episode of ""Lost"" the character was reading ""Everything That Rises Must Converge"" in the last scene. So, counterintuitively, she's only growing in importance. CNN: It's amazing that she had a literary career at all, given how debilitating her illness was. Gooch: What became inspiring to me, unexpectedly, writing this book [was how she dealt] with her illness, and that she finally was nobody's victim. ... Everything we think of as a Flannery O'Connor story came after she had been diagnosed as having lupus and settled in to life in the South. You get the sense that this was almost a magical thinking, where she thought that writing these stories was keeping her alive.",0.52911675,7884
213,"(CNN) -- The biggest challenge was finding an Edward. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart play Edward and Bella in ""Twilight."" ""The most perfect guy in the world,"" ""Twilight"" director Catherine Hardwicke said, ticking off the characteristics of ""Twilight's"" vampire hero. ""Cannot be Leo [DiCaprio]; cannot be Brad Pitt. They don't fit in high school anymore. And there are a lot of cute guys, but do they really look like they've lived for 108 years?"" Probably not, but with a fan base as large as ""Twilight's,"" Hardwicke had to search for one. And if the thousands of screaming girls who show up at autograph signings are any measure, she found him in Robert Pattinson. The actor, best known for playing Cedric Diggory in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" has faced mob scenes wherever he's appeared. Fans in Dallas waited overnight in the rain for a chance to see him; an event in San Francisco was delayed because of the crush. Pattinson is still surprised by the reaction. Though things started quietly during filming, by the time production was wrapping, ""there were like 200 people turning up to the set every day,"" he said.  ""And now, if we were trying to shoot it now, it would be absolutely impossible to do anything. Because where ever there's a 'Twilight,' anything mentioned about 'Twilight,' thousands of people turn up."" ""Twilight's"" many fans -- most of whom will get their first feature-length glimpse of Edward when the film opens with midnight showings Friday -- can't wait for the witching hour. They also haven't been afraid of letting Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan in the film based on Stephenie Meyer's series of books, know about their feelings for ""Twilight"" -- and Edward. Some have been downright disdainful, Stewart told CNN at the Los Angeles interviews for the film. ""Very communicative looks,"" Stewart said. ""Like, 'I'm just letting you know with this look that you're nothing special. ... I'm here for Edward, and I hope you don't ruin the movie.' It's really crazy."" Stewart doesn't let it bother her, though. She's been focused on  portraying Bella, a clumsy, awkward 17-year-old who moves into a small town that she finds quite boring. Boring, that is, until she meets and falls in love with Edward(Pattinson).  Watch Pattinson greet a line of screaming fans » . The vampires created by Meyer are different from those of the past. They dress fashionably, have good taste in art and music, and are very much human. ""They are the main characters,"" Stewart said. ""They are the people that you sympathize with. They're not just the villains in the movie."" Edward is one of the Cullen family of vampires, a clan that has stopped drinking human blood. ""He made his world smaller and smaller so he never killed anybody,"" Pattinson said of his character. ""And he didn't care about anyone else. Imagine, never having an emotion ... and then suddenly this girl comes into your life. As well as breaking down all your self-discipline, which you've had for 80 years, she also makes you feel everything again."" Edward and Bella must overcome obstacles worthy of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in their relationship. (Besides the differences in her background with Edward, Bella is also stalked by a vampire with fewer scruples than the Cullen boy.) But it's that sexual tension that makes the whole vampire culture so undeniably delicious, Hardwicke said. ""The idea of this incredibly seductive creature wanting to bite your neck,"" she said. ""And if he does, on one level it could be pleasurable. If he goes too far, you could die. That kind of razor's edge, that sexual tension, is incredibly seductive."" That doesn't mean the film is all lovey-dovey. Hardwicke and the movie's stunt coordinator spent hours trying to figure out how to keep the fight scenes true to Meyer's books. Meyer's vampires can't be killed with stakes or holy water; they have to be ripped limb from limb. And then what's left has to be burned. ""How do you fight when you're trying to pull somebody's arms off or twist their head off?"" Hardwicke asked. ""That makes for a different kind of fight."" Romance, seduction and violence are all well and good, elements that have fulfilled audience desires for decades. But it's the vampires that give those characteristics an extra edge, whether it's in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Twilight."" iReport.com: Are you planning to see 'Twilight'? ""A vampire itself is just such a great template for making a mysterious character,"" Pattinson said. ""They can only come out at night. They have a dark secret, which by vampire law they're not allowed to tell anybody. And the only people who find out, die."" ""Twilight"" is based on the first of Meyer's now four-book series. So will the movie ""Twilight"" follow in the footsteps of another book series with a huge audience, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter tales? Hardwicke said she doesn't know. ""Stephenie went a little wild [in the sequel] and wrote all these visual effects and werewolves and Italy and everything,"" she said. ""So the next book is going to be a lot more expensive [to make]. But if this one makes enough, then we'll get to do it."" CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this story.",0.5284529,1631
214,"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Nancy Grace's new novel ""The Eleventh Victim.""  published by Hyperion. Nancy anchors ""Nancy Grace"" on HLN nightly at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET. HLN's Nancy Grace makes her fiction debut with ""The Eleventh Victim."" A little something. What was it? Something...some detail was wrong.  . He couldn't just leave the body lying there like that. There was something missing. It was biting at him. He'd tried to go, walking back to his car in the dark twice now, but the nagging in his brain wouldn't let him leave until she was absolutely perfect. He looked at her lying there in the moonlight. Her dead body was absolutely stunning. Before, when she had been alive, sitting in the passenger seat of his car, talking and talking about her life and herself and her journey from Anniston, Alabama, to Atlanta to break into acting, he thought his head would blow up like a bomb. She just wouldn't shut up. What did she think it was...a date? She was a hooker. He spotted her climbing the steep steps out of the MARTA subway station downtown. She got straight into his car with a big smile when he offered her a ride. Once inside, driving, he kept looking away from the road, stealing glances at her neck. Something about it drew him. Maybe the shape, the curve -- or maybe it was the soft hollow spot at the bottom. It was the only thing about her he could stomach. Watch Nancy talk about her new novel » . He lowered the automatic windows so her conversation would fly out into the night and he wouldn't have to hear it. Her teeth and lips revolted him. The shiny pink lip gloss she was wearing had thickened in spots across her lips and some had smeared onto her front teeth. Looking over at her as she talked, Cruise thought it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Back to the task at hand. What was it? It was maddening...he couldn't bring himself to leave until everything was just right...perfect, in fact. Every detail mattered. Like a delicate soufflé or performing his specialty, decorating with boiling-hot spun sugar, perfection was achieved only by acute attention to detail. There, in the dark of the clearing, it hit him. Turning, he walked to his car and reached through the open window into the glove compartment and got it. The baker's twine. It was his favorite brand --it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from France. He had posed her on her back. The four bright-red puncture marks torn into her mid-back didn't bother him at all. In fact, the dark red against the white skin created a vivid contrast that was somehow pleasing to him. Walking back to her body, which he had spread carefully on a bed of soft grass to more suitably frame her pale limbs in a night lit only by the moon, he paused again. He needed the perfect spot. He couldn't rush this or he wouldn't sleep all night. The wrist? Like a bracelet? No. She was wearing a tacky, gold-tone watch. That would ruin the whole thing for him. And he couldn't bring himself to actually touch the timepiece she wore there on her right wrist. It looked cheap; he was sure the gold-tone finish was turning dark at the edges of the band. The neck? No. It was much too close to the lip gloss. The gloss had a faint, fruity odor, foul as gasoline fumes to Cruise, and that alone made him want to retch. It would totally destroy the twine's effect. Sometime during their ""date,"" fresh, damp dirt and a little grass had smeared horizontally across her mouth and worked its way up into her nose. He left it there. That was a beautiful and poetic touch of nature, but the lip gloss...disgusting. As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night. And as he relived that moment, it came to him in an epiphany. He decided...the left ring finger. Perfect. He squatted down and gently picked up her left hand. The wrist was still limp. He tied a single, perfect bow around her ring finger just before rigor set in...before the body went stiff and cold and hard. He placed the hand back gently across her stomach. Backing away a few feet to take in the whole picture, finally, he could relax. Every detail was exquisite. Finally, he could get some sleep. The bow was perfectly symmetrical, and there, in the moonlight, it was just gorgeous. Almost like a wedding band. From THE ELEVENTH VICTIM by Nancy Grace. Copyright © 2009 Toto Holdings, LLC.

216,"(CNN) -- They feature characters such as hat-wearing cats, very hungry caterpillars, nice girls named Madeline and naughty boys named Max. ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" by Eric Carle turns 40 this year, and 29 million copies of it have sold since 1969. Parents read them to their children, forming a powerful bond. Years later, those former children read these children's picture books to their children, and the thread between generations is extended yet again. ""Children's books live a long time because you always have children growing into them,"" says Pat Scales, president of the Association for Library Service to Children and a retired school librarian. ""And parents read [to their children] what was read to them."" The making of a classic is a strange alchemy of skill -- a good story, strong illustrations -- and luck. It's not easy to appeal to three audiences: publishers, parents and -- oh, yes -- children. Dr. Seuss' first children's book, ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,"" was rejected by more than 25 publishers before Vanguard Press put it out in 1937. Maurice Sendak's legendary ""Where the Wild Things Are"" (1963), though recognized with the Caldecott Medal -- the highest honor for a picture book -- was controversial for its drawings of monsters and its mischievous hero, Max. But almost all classics share some characteristics, says Alida Allison, a San Diego State University English professor and member of that California school's National Center for the Study of Children's Literature. ""Every one of them ... has the same reassuring pattern of 'home, away, home,' "" she says. ""The basic plot begins with a happy family situation. Then one extremely curious or transgressive child goes out on his or her own. And, no matter how 'bad' the child has been, he gets to come back home."" The child is welcomed back to the family and often gets something to eat, she adds. (One exception: Seuss' ""Mulberry,"" in which the adult condemns the child's sense of wonder -- but then, she adds, ""Dr. Seuss is in a world of his own."") The plot isn't just reassuring to children, she points out, but also reinforces the lessons of good parenting. ""If you think of all those stories, there's a loving parent ... allowing a transgressive kid a leash to investigate the world and come back,"" she says. And through the child's eyes, parents find their sense of wonder renewed, she adds. For children, it's all new -- the colors, the wordplay, even the plot -- and the more variety, the better. A child may be attracted by the rudimentary drawings of Eric Carle's ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar,"" the elasticity of Seuss' cats, Grinches and Oobleck, or the rich, almost otherworldly paintings of Chris Van Allsburg's ""The Polar Express."" And the language: Margaret Wise Brown's ""Goodnight Moon"" may seem to be nothing much, but it's as peaceful as a lullaby, Scales observes. And nothing succeeds like a book that has found its way into a child's heart. ""We know that kids return to their favorite books over and over again,"" Scales says. And then, of course, the story starts from the beginning. Allison, a published author herself, read a variety of books to her children when they were growing up: Dorothy Kunhardt's ""Pat the Bunny,"" Russell Hoban's ""Frances"" books. But at least one title earned its way into the rotation because of an older fan: Allison's husband. ""One of my husband's favorites growing up was 'The Pokey Little Puppy,' "" she says of the 1942 Little Golden Book by Janette Sebring Lowrey and Gustaf Tenggren. ""So he read that to our sons.""",0.5142338,2227

218,"(CNET) -- If you want to consider a difficult computational problem, try thinking of the algorithms required to animate more than 10,000 helium balloons, each with its own string, but each also interdependent on the rest, which are collectively hoisting aloft a small house. The production team at Pixar faced many new technological challenges on ""Up,"" its tenth feature film. That was the challenge the production team at Pixar faced when it set out to begin work on ""Up,"" its tenth feature film, five years in the works, which hits theaters on Friday. There was absolutely no way the team was going to hand-animate the balloons. Not with their numbers in five-figures, and especially not when you consider that within the cluster, every interaction between two balloons has a ripple effect: If one bumped another, the second would move, likely bumping a third, and so on. And every bit of this would need to be seen on screen. In ""Up,"" the story revolves around the main character, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen, who, frustrated with his mundane life, ties the thousands of balloons to his house and sets off for adventures in South America. A small boy ends up marooned on board, and hilarity ensues. The cluster of balloons is so central to the film's branding--it's called ""Up,"" after all--that to promote the film, Pixar teamed up with two of the world's cluster ballooning experts for a nationwide tour involving a real-life flying armchair and dozens of huge, colorful balloons. ""You have a movie that's about a house that flies, which is a pretty far-fetched idea,"" said Steve May, the supervising technical director on ""Up."" ""We all know, from kids' parties, how a bunch of balloons behave, so if we could animate balloons in a realistic way, the believability that the house could fly would sell."" For May, ""Up"" producer Jonas Rivera, director Pete Docter, and the many others involved in making the film, believability was key, even within the context of a story about a flying house. And while a major part of instilling that believability must come from a well-conceived and executed story and script, the animation is no less responsible for winning over potentially skeptical audiences. Balloons, the mother of animation invention May said that the animation department at Pixar never even considered hand-animating the balloons. But even standard computer animation wouldn't be up to the task, because of the N-squared complexity involved in the thousands of interdependent balloons. Instead, the studio's computer whizzes figured out a way to turn the problem over to a programmed physical simulator, which, employing Newtonian physics, was able to address the animation problem. ""These are relatively simple physical equations, so you program them into the computer and therefore kind of let the computer animate things for you, using those physics,"" said May. ""So in every frame of the animation, (the computer can) literally compute the forces acting on those balloons, (so) that they're buoyant, that their strings are attached, that wind is blowing through them. And based on those forces, we can compute how the balloon should move."" This process is known as procedural animation, and is described by an algorithm or set of equations, and is in stark contrast to what is known as key frame animation, in which the animators explicitly define the movement of an object or objects in every frame. Procedural animation has been around for some time, but May suggested that even the most difficult uses of it in the past don't come close to what Pixar had to achieve in ""Up."" Pixar fans may remember the scenes in ""Cars"" of a stadium full of 300,000 car ""fans"" cheering on a high-speed race below, each of which was independently animated. That, too, was done with procedural animation, May said, since creating so many cars individually would have been a non-starter. But even that complex computation problem didn't approach the balloon cluster issue in ""Up"": the ""Cars"" scene involved no interdependent physics. Getting the simulator humming properly is no easy task, as one might imagine. May said it involves setting rules for how individual objects should behave, giving the computer these initial conditions, and then ""let it run."" Oddly, because the simulator does indeed run with those conditions and rules and the peculiarities of physics, the animators found themselves without precise control of what would happen with the balloons--or other objects in the film animated using these techniques. ""If the (balloon cluster) is moving too slow, we increase the amount of wind, and then run the simulator again,"" May said. ""Then maybe we turn the wind down. It's a little fun science experiment where sometimes, hopefully by the end, we're getting what we want."" Losing control of balloons Sometimes, given the vagaries of physics and chaos theory, unexpected things happen. The computer team inputs the rules and because some of the initial conditions are random, ""you get semi-random results."" One of May's favorite examples is that early in the film, when the house first is hoisted aloft by the balloons, a small group of the balloons actually broke off of the main cluster. May said that this breakaway group of balloons is actually visible--albeit very briefly--in ""Up."" Eagle-eyed moviegoers can see the escaped balloons in the upper right-hand side of the screen, he said. ""We didn't mean for that to happen,"" he said, ""but (we said) 'It's cool, let's keep it.'"" Even being able to make such choices wasn't possible at the beginning of the film's production, however. May said Pixar's physical simulator, an open-source program called ODE, couldn't initially handle the complexity of modeling the behavior of more than 10,000 balloons. ""We could handle about 500 (balloons), and we knew we needed tens of thousands,"" he said. ""We knew we needed to develop a new simulator software pipeline...to handle an order of magnitude more complex simulation."" Of course, at Pixar, adjusting to evolving computer needs on the fly is nothing new. In fact, May said the studio has done so in one form or another on many of its films. For example, he said that when the studio made ""Monsters, Inc.,"" it had to figure out how to animate the movie's monsters' fur. Similarly, when Pixar made ""Finding Nemo,"" the animators had to figure out how to simulate underwater scenes. ""We had to learn about (how light refracts under water), and murk and how particulates float under water,"" May said. And in ""Up,"" too, there were additional animation challenges. Among them were figuring out how to animate and render the feathers on Kevin, a bird that is a major character in the film, and how to make the cloth on (main character) Carl's clothes seem believable. Carl's threads were ""the hardest clothing we've ever had to animate here,"" said May, ""in part because Carl's a (small) man in an oversized suit. That was another case of (using) the physical simulation, and of setting up rules for how cloth should behave. And the looser the clothing, the more it can behave badly."" Even Carl himself presented some animation difficulties, May said, because the character's head is shaped like a cube. Like many other elements in ""Up,"" the cube-shape of Carl's face wasn't a random whim of the director. Rather, it is a story element: May explained that Carl's character is based on someone who, as a young man, was vivacious and adventurous. But as he grew older, his small house became more and more surrounded by buildings, and ""it's like his world has compressed him into a square."" Thus, a cube-like face. But May said animating his facial expressions, which must fit into this cube shape, was complicated. Smiles, for example, had to come up and wrap around his cheek. Still, for the award-winning filmmakers at Pixar, the goal is to make even the hardest animation problems look simple on the silver screen. As producer Jonas Rivera put it, ""The audience looks at (the balloon cluster) and says, 'Oh, that's pretty.' But they have no idea how much work went into it. We worked on that for over a year. (Then) the kid takes off his hat and runs his fingers through his hair. My mother will never know that took 15 people six weeks."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

222,"(CNN) -- David Michaelis' new biography of Charles M. Schulz explores the man behind  ""Peanuts,"" the comic strip that has delighted readers for decades. CNN.com appealed to fans out there to say what Linus, Lucy and Charlie Brown meant to them. Joy Hernandez has collected stuffed Snoopys since she was young; her dog, Dottie, is a Snoopy doppelganger. Readers responded with tales of bonding with family members while reading ""Peanuts,"" even meeting Schulz and finding inspiration and companionship in the strip's characters. Below is a selection of responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity: . Elise Marrion of Midland, Texas My grandmother always loved ""Peanuts,"" and across the generations, that was one of the things we shared. When I was 7 years old, I spent a summer with her in Denver and every morning, I raced to find ""Peanuts"" in the comics section. A retired teacher, Grandma always made me read at least one front-page news story before I was allowed to read the comics. That task turned into a great love of newspapers, and it inspired me to pursue a career in journalism. Sadly she passed away before I received my degree, but I still keep her Peppermint Patty doll to remind me of her and our times reading ""Peanuts"" together. Kimberly Mercier of Santa Rosa, California The ""Peanuts"" characters were more like friends, when I was growing up. Woodstock and Snoopy were always my favorites, even today. I spent many years ice skating in Santa Rosa as a child and would often see Charles Schulz there at his favorite table in the Warm Puppy Cafe in front of the fireplace. Sometimes, we got to watch him and his ""senior"" team play broomball on the ice. They enjoyed themselves so much. Mr. Schulz was always kind and friendly to me, and when I became an adult with sons of my own, he treated them with equal kindness, a warm smile and hello. We have the loveliest memories of the ""Peanuts"" characters and their creator, a beloved man in our town. Susan Clifton of Chalfont, Pennsylvania This is more a comment on Mr. Schulz than the ""Peanuts"" characters. I was in my early teens and a huge hockey fan. I loved the ""Peanuts"" programs and coloring books and my parents told me that Charles Schulz was a big hockey fan, too. I wrote him a letter telling him of our shared interest, and before I knew it, I received a personalized letter, along with two cartoons with the ""Peanuts"" gang playing hockey -- each signed with a little note. I treasured that letter and personalized cartoons so much and always loved him for the fact that he would take the time to send them to me. It pains me beyond words that those pieces got lost along the way and are gone forever. Zac Davis of Blue Springs, Missouri My favorite ""Peanuts"" strip shows Snoopy typing on his typewriter a statement that details a struggle in many men's lives (apparently even Schulz's own): ""Girls and root beer are not the answer."" Brian Heraty of Chicago, Illinois I remember snippets of the ""Peanuts"" gang throughout my childhood. ... From ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" and Christmas specials to ""Snoopy vs. the Red Baron,"" memories of Charlie Brown and the gang abound. In all that time, there were always two answers that eluded me: Why are all the boys bald or balding, and what's the deal with Peppermint Patty? Pedro Valle of San Juan, Puerto Rico My favorite ""Peanuts"" character has always been Linus Van Pelt. His view on humanity is unique, like an outsider looking in. In fact, my favorite ""Peanuts"" moment ever is when Charlie Brown challenges Linus' dream to become a little country doctor. He asks Linus how he could become a doctor if he can't deal with humanity. The very wise Linus responds: ""I love humanity; it's people I can't stand."" That sums up my own feelings to the letter. Vicki Boston of Tucson, Arizona I always love watching Charlie Brown and his ""Peanuts"" gang on the holiday specials. I see myself as a Marcie or Peppermint Patty type. I even played Peppermint Patty in grade school when we did two Charlie Brown skits, and I loved it. Melanie Taylor of Manchester, England I am 33 years of age and still enjoy watching the ""Peanuts"" cartoon shows. The Charlie Brown Christmas special would be, to this day, my ultimate favorite. As a kid, I hated being bullied, put down, let down, always had very few true friends who never passed judgment on me. In that, Charlie was ""me."" Linus would be my best friend Tammy, and no matter what, through thick and thin, Tammy was by my side, no matter how cruel the world was around us. We both had a true friendship bond back then. She is someone I wish I knew where she was. I would call her this instant if I knew how or where to find her. I would be calling her up and telling her that ""our show is on."" Shannon Brady of Austin, Texas I remember having ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" when I was very little. I used to watch that thing about 50 times a day till it finally died. Charlie Brown was the greatest. Kat Smith of Fort Washington, Maryland I have been a fan of ""Peanuts"" since I was a young girl. My aunt was a fan, and through her I too became a fan. There are so many quips and strips to choose from, but my all-time favorite quotes come from Linus. One came about during breakfast with his sister, Lucy, and some dialogue about snicker-snacks (the cereal they were eating). I don't remember all of it, but Linus told Lucy, ""My heart bleeds for the snicker-snacks company."" And of course there is the strip where Snoopy sent a sincere letter to the IRS asking it to please remove him from its mailing list. ... I've often wondered if I could do the same. Classic. Mark Eustace of Burlington, Ontario The greatest moment was in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" when Linus walks on stage with a single spotlight and explains the true meaning of Christmas. At my house you could hear a pin drop during that scene. Cassey Pelkey of Birmingham, England The most touching strip was the one printed just after Charles Schulz's death. I have been a ""Peanuts"" since I was 2 years old, and absolutely love them all. I think we can all see a little bit of Lucy, Peppermint Patty, Pigpen, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Linus ... in ourselves if we reflect on it. That's what makes it endearing. ... It's about Everyman. Kelly Cromwell of New York I have been a ""Peanuts"" fan since a young child. Drawing Snoopy and collecting comic books were an obsession when growing up. So when I decided to get a tattoo at age 28, I could think of nothing better than a dancing Snoopy. Ten years later, it still makes me smile. Joe Keilholz of Apex, North Carolina I have loved Charlie Brown since I was a kid. There isn't a single holiday that doesn't feel complete without watching any of the animated series, and not a day goes by without reading the classic strip. I've even gone so far as to try and get a tattoo with my face caricatured on Charlie Brown's body. The ring tone on my cell phone is Linus and Lucy, the e-mail address I send to everyone is Charlie Brown and my login names on almost every site are Charlie Brown-related. I can actually go on a bit more than this, but feel I should stop here. Needless to say, I feel very much like I'm a real life Charlie Brown. As to a catchphrase, of course the classic ""Good Grief"" is among the leaders. Grace Cavanaugh of Novato, California I have loved Snoopy and the gang for as long as I can remember. My first boyfriend gave me his Snoopy collection when he found out how much I loved the beagle. I still have it all. I think that Peppermint Patty would be the ""Peanuts"" character that I most identify with. She is bold but sometimes just so unsure of herself that it hits the right cord. Jacquelyn Bradley-Petersen of Ontario, California You can never get enough of the ""Peanuts"" gang. I always try and read the comic strip, but constantly watch the show, old videos and every special on every occasion. I will always love Charlie Brown. Watching it makes me smile and get into a zone where I forget about the day and everything else around me. Complete fun and goodness, serenity. Everyone can relate to one of the characters, especially Charlie Brown. At least I can. Thank you for talking about this and letting me relive some memories and have a nice moment.

223,"(CNN) -- Strange things seem to happen when Grant Wilson enters a room. Grant Wilson, left, and partner Jason Hawes were driven by personal experiences to track ghosts. Human forms materialize in darkened hallways. The dead whisper greetings from beyond the grave. Unseen entities attack and hurl terrified people to the ground. Every day is Halloween for Wilson, co-star of the Sci Fi Channel's hit show, ""Ghost Hunters."" Close encounters of the paranormal kind would drive most people to look for another hobby, but Wilson says he ain't afraid of no ghosts. ""That's part of the job,"" says Wilson, who investigates suspected hauntings with his co-host, Jason Hawes.. ""We tell everyone that we train that you'll be punched, slapped and grabbed. Be prepared for it."" Anyone who has watched their 401(k) account evaporate during the recent stock market dive knows something about horror. But Wilson is part of a growing community that prefers getting their chills the old-fashioned way. They are ghost hunters, or, as they prefer to be called, paranormal investigators. ""Ghost-Hunters,"" which airs a special live show at 7 p.m. Halloween night, is helping lift the stigma once attached to paranormal investigators. The show has become so popular that the group featured in each episode -- The Atlantic Paranormal Society - has spawned imitators across the United States and affiliates in 12 countries. TAPS, as the ""Ghost Hunters"" group is informally known, even has its own ""Beyond Reality Radio"" show, magazine, lecture tours, T-shirts --and groupies. ""Ghost Hunters"" has made creepy cool, says David Schrader, a paranormal investigator and co-host of ""Darkness Radio,"" a radio show that investigates paranormal activity. ""Five or six years ago, you'd be embarrassed to sit around the water cooler talking about ghosts, but now everybody talks about it -- it's gone mainstream,"" Schrader says. It's also gone Hollywood. Paranormal shows like ""Paranormal State"" on A&E Television; ""Haunting Evidence"" on truTV (which, like CNN.com, is owned by Time Warner); ""Dead Famous"" on the Biography Channel; and ""A Haunting"" on the Discovery Channel are trying to mimic the success of ""Ghost Hunters."" Paranormal investigators aren't just chasing ghosts anymore; they're chasing television gigs, Schrader says. ""Everybody I know has a pilot in development -- including me,"" Schrader says. ""They throw it around like Frisbees. It's become a joke."" The paranormal shows have also created a paranormal circuit. Families and friends attend ghost-hunting conventions, retreats (one was dubbed ""GhoStock,"") swap tips on ghost-hunting gear and make pilgrimages to famous haunted places like The Stanley Hotel in Colorado, the setting for the Stephen King movie, ""The Shining.""  I hear dead people. » . Why they chase ghosts . Many of these amateur paranormal investigators are inspired -- and freaked out - by what they see on ""Ghost Hunters."" Some of the incidents recorded by ""Ghost Hunters"" are mystifying: Ghostly forms appear on camera, chairs lurch across rooms by themselves and voices of people long dead are played back to their wide-eyed relatives. In one of the most famous ""Ghost Hunters"" episodes, a cameraman is grabbed and hurled to the ground --though no one appears to touch him. The cameraman is so shaken that he sobs and quits the show. Wilson says people who think they have a ghost at home should not try a do-it-yourself home ghost repair. A person who uses Ouija boards or anything else to contact ghosts can unleash malevolent spirits. ""You might not be ready for what happens,"" Wilson says. Watch Grant's encounter with a ghost » . Some ghost-hunters say they entered the field because, like Wilson, they had personal experiences with the supernatural. Others want to know if there is something beyond death. Others like Marley Gibson, an author and paranormal investigator says they're more scared by current events. ""We're living in a world where we're fighting two wars, we've got poverty, homelessness, people not having health care and a job -- people want escapism,"" says Gibson, author of  ""Ghost Huntress: The Awakening"" a forthcoming book that follows the exploits of a 16-year-old girl who forms a paranormal research team. Ask ghost hunters if they get scared and many give the same reply -- I don't do scared, just startled. Gibson says many ghost-hunters go into investigations armed with strong spiritual beliefs. ""I've never met such spiritually-grounded, religious, God-fearing people as I have in the paranormal community,"" she says. 'I felt a ... very large finger or a paw poke me in the back' Sometimes paranormal investigators, though, admit they experience what Schrader, the Darkness Radio co-host calls, ""Oh [bleep]' moments."" Schrader had one last December, when he apparently took his job home with him one evening. He visited his ex-wife and children after coming back from a ghost-hunting retreat and decided to spend the night in the basement. Around three in the morning, he says, he heard his then one-year-old daughter screaming. He ran upstairs to hear her say that a shadow was watching her in her room. He comforted his daughter and returned to sleep downstairs. His wife then called him an hour later on his cell phone from her bedroom and whispered: ""Get up in my room. There's something here and I can see it."" Nothing was there but Schrader says some spirits had apparently thought it was OK to pay a visit to his family. He says people who are open to the existence of ghosts sometimes become ""beacons"" that attract spirits. Schrader decided to solve the problem by calling for a supernatural version of pest-control. He blessed the house with holy water and called in two ""demonologist"" to cleanse the house. No more ghosts. Patrick Burns, a paranormal investigator and co-host of ""Haunting Evidence,"" had one of his teeth-chattering moments when there was no one around to call. He says he was working on a documentary on ghosts from his home computer one night when he felt something touch him. ""I felt a very pronounced poke with a very large finger, or possibly a paw, just above my beltline on the back,"" he says. Now the average person might have taken that as a cue to run from the room. But Burns is a professional, and besides, he has his own paranormal television show. He shrugged and kept working. Then, he says, he felt the room temperature drop. Cold spots are often associated with hauntings, but Burns kept working because, as he said later: ""No way is my house is haunted."" Finally, he heard a thud that sounded like a body slammed against the wall. The impact is so hard that it shook the house, he says. ""I throw off my headphones and say, 'Okay you have my attention now,' ""Burns says. ""After that, nothing else happened. It just wanted me to acknowledge that it was there."" Sometimes encounters with the living can be just as strange as their encounters with the paranormal, ghost hunters say. Wilson, the  ""Ghost Hunters"" co-host, says he's more leery of people than ghosts. Paranormal investigators like him and Burns are now so famous that they have adoring fans. Wilson is a Roto-Rooter plumber by day, but he had to stop answering residential calls because too many people were breaking their toilets just to meet him Hawes, his ghost hunting/plumbing partner. Though Wilson says he's never been scared by a ghost, he still sounds shaken by one encounter. He says he once met an entity that displayed a personal interest in him. She appeared in front of him, displayed a tattoo of his face stenciled on her leg, and asked him what he thought. The ""entity"" was a fan Wilson met during a public appearance. ""That,"" Wilson admits, ""was a little scary.""",0.45561558,1332

A contender for the title of Africa's most widely read novelist, his first work ""Things Fall Apart"" has been translated into 40 languages. ""I think story telling was my life.
