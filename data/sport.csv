A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says it's time to get over the fact that baseball turned a blind eye to steroid use. (CNN) -- I loved baseball as a kid. I still have fond memories of my siblings and me, members of the ""Astro Buddies"" club, heading to the Astrodome, the eighth wonder of the world, to watch the Houston Astros play. I played the game in elementary and high school. But now, I'm sick of it, especially when steroids are brought up. The latest baseball drama surrounds a New York Times report quoting two lawyers who say that former Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa's name was on a list of players who tested positive for an illegal substance in 2003. The list supposedly contains more than 100 names of players who tested positive that year. This report comes on the heels of Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees admitting that he used performance-enhancing drugs a few years ago; Manny Ramirez testing positive and suspended for 50 games; and the continuing drama surrounding Roger Clemens. All three were considered locks for the Hall of Fame. But based on what we keep hearing, that'll never happen in this holier-than-thou era. OK, got it. Baseball had a terrible drug problem. Now they have a drug testing plan in place that has some teeth in it. So, can we just move the hell on? Seriously, I'm tired of rehashing the drama. As a sports enthusiast, I would love nothing better than to think that athletes in baseball, football, basketball or any other sport are as pure as heroes from yesteryear. But cheating is cheating. It has been around from Day One, and if a player thinks he can get an edge, well, it's a good bet some will try to get it. Sosa has always been suspected of using drugs, but now that two lawyers say they saw his name on the infamous sheet, he has gone, according to Rick Telander's column in the Chicago Sun-Times, ""from hero to zero."" But you know what? I don't care. Can we just all accept the fact that all of baseball -- players, management, owners, the unions -- turned a blind eye to performance-enhancing drugs ravaging the sport? And they did so because baseball was on its way to being comparable to the National Hockey League or soccer in the U.S. -- irrelevant to sports fans. After the strike in 1994 wiped out the World Series, fans were angry and didn't give a lick about the sport. But then came 1998 and the home-run derby put on by St. Louis Cardinal Mark McGwire and Sosa, both trying to break the record of 61 homers in a year set by Roger Maris of the New York Yankees. Fans were riveted by the hitting prowess of the two, and people were following their every at-bat. I was working at KRLD-AM in Dallas, Texas, that summer, and we would break into programming to broadcast the call of their at-bats when they were about to break the record. Yea, everyone had Sosa-McGwire fever. Baseball became relevant again. The players redeemed themselves, management was happy to say they worked for the sport, and the owners were delirious because the money came rolling in. So there we have it. All of baseball pulled a Robert Johnson, as in the legend of the classic blues singer who supposedly got his gift for music by making a pact with the devil. Or maybe more like Judas. The sport turned in its integrity for a few pieces of silver. Let's just accept this as a fact, acknowledge those were the dark days and move on. It's just tiring to keep going back to what happened then. It's done. It's over. So let it go. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.",0.7338116,4826
1,"(CNN) -- Cal Ripken Jr. will always be known for his consecutive games played streak, but it may surprise many people that just two years into his big-league career, he already was planning for life after baseball. Cal Ripken Jr. is introduced to the crowd at the 2002 All-Star Game in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While many of the athletes who took to the playing fields of major league baseball this season only are focused on the game, Ripken began saving and planning for retirement long before his career neared its end. ""When I joined the Orioles [in 1982], the team was transitioning,"" said Ripken, who will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in July. ""I saw guys who were 34, 35, 36 years old -- still young guys -- about to get out of the game, and I wondered what will they do now? ""It got me thinking about what I would want to do when I got out of the game. Most people don't realize how fast the time goes, but I turned those questions on myself."" Though he quickly points out that he didn't dwell on those questions, Ripken admits it got him thinking, and eventually planning, so that when retirement came in 2001, the shift from baseball to business was easy. ""From the outside, I'm sure it looked like a smooth transition just by virtue of the fact that I had another thing to go into,"" he said. ""I had prepared for what was next."" These days, five seasons after retiring from a 21-year career he spent with the Baltimore Orioles, Ripken is a businessman, team owner, radio-show host and author. He also will be a baseball analyst for TBS, which like CNN.com is owned by Time Warner. Ripken jumped full time into his company, Ripken Baseball, without taking any break, lessening the emotional jolt of retirement. ""I didn't give myself the luxury of taking a month off [after the baseball season],"" he said. ""I think I would have opened myself up to regret, thinking about the past. I had to get a minor league baseball team in that stadium. I just put my head down and started working."" Ripken's first post-baseball venture was developing a youth ballpark in his hometown of Aberdeen, Maryland, financed in part by a $75,000 gift from the Major League Baseball Players Association. It was presented to him the night he broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played. Ripken was a ""rookie"" for the second time in his life, this time in business. ""I was learning all over again, learning what was important,"" he said. ""The off-season never went by so fast. I had meetings, phone calls, plans and long days in the office. ""By the time I looked up, [the Orioles] were at spring training. I didn't think, 'They left without me,' which is what I thought I would do."" Ripken's latest project is a business principles book called ""Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference,"" co-authored by Donald T. Phillips. The book, available April 10, was born out a speech Ripken gave about the ""secrets"" of his success. Writing it turned out to be an emotional journey, he said. ""I got to reflect on what my parents had taught me, the values and principles, right and wrong,"" Ripken said. ""It's good to be in touch with those things."" The fact is, whether in baseball or business, Ripken rarely strays from the principles he learned from his late father, Cal Sr., a former player and manager. The book is filled with anecdotes from on and off the field. Now 46, Ripken is president and CEO of Ripken Baseball, and his brother, Bill, a former teammate, is executive vice president. The company owns minor league teams in Aberdeen and in Augusta, Georgia. The brothers also have co-written two books on baseball and co-host a baseball call-in show on weekends on XM Radio. There were reports in December that Ripken was heading a group that was interested in buying the Orioles, but Baltimore owner Peter Angelos denied that claim. ""There is no question that Cal and I have a great relationship,"" Angelos told The (Baltimore) Sun. ""He was a great player for the Orioles, and I have an affection for him. But what's being reported, there is simply no substance to it. It has not happened. There have been no such discussions."" Still, Ripken said he probably would ""stick his nose in"" if the Orioles became available. Ripken, who has a boy and a girl, also has ventured into children's literature, and his first book is scheduled to be released Thursday. ""The Longest Season"" tells the story of the 21-game losing streak Ripken and his Orioles teammates endured in 1988 and teaches the lessons of perseverance. Ripken also continues his longstanding association with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America through the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation. The foundation says it has refurbished fields, donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Boys and Girls Clubs throughout the country and teamed up with Nike to help provide baseball and softball equipment to school sports programs nationwide. Asked what type of advice he would offer to young professional baseball players, Ripken said, ""Put that [huge contract] aside, save your money, that's your nest egg. In the off-season, think about skill development or the interests you have in a small way but be very careful. ""You can't think too much about retirement as a young player. You have to live a narrow existence for your sport."" E-mail to a friend .",0.7331114,4952
2,"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Bobby Murcer's biggest fan . Former New York Yankee Bobby Murcer warms up  during Old Timers Day Yankee Stadium on July 7. Our first story has a fairy-tale middle and a horrible ending. In August of '77, Bobby Murcer of the Cubs promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan Scott Crull. That night, Murcer hit two of them. Pretty amazing, especially when you consider Murcer only hit nine homers the whole next season. But that's not why Crull -- a 12-year-old from Calumet City, Illinois -- makes this list. Broadcasting the game nationally on ABC, Keith Jackson told the country how Murcer had fulfilled the dying boy's last wish. Eyes watered, spines tingled. There was only one problem -- nobody had ever told the boy he was dying. His parents were horrified. Weeks later, Crull passed away. 2. The good luck charmers . Every sport has its own strange traditions. I'd argue hockey's ""throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck"" is the weirdest. Tossing the eight-tentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of Detroit storeowners Pete & Jerry Cusimano. The date: April 15, 1952. The logic: one tentacle for each of the eight victories it took to win the Stanley Cup. Later that spring, most likely fueled by the good luck octopus, the Red Wings won the title. PETA has objected to this practice, which continues to this day. The Red Wings mascot is not a Red Wing, but Al the Octopus. 3. The John 3:16 guy . Also known as ""Rainbow Man,"" the born-again Rollen Stewart and his John 3:16 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s. He brought his message to the World Series, Super Bowl, Olympics, and World Cup. He was outside Buckingham Palace when Di and Charles wed; he went to see the Pope in Alaska. But he was more religious fanatic than sports fan. According to the Los Angeles Times, Stewart planned to assassinate President Bush and candidate Clinton in 1992. And he's now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a Los Angeles Hyatt, also in 1992. By the way, chapter three, verse sixteen of the Gospel of John says, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" This is also printed on cups at the In-N-Out Burger. 4. The All-Star heckler . For 12 years, Maryland lawyer and Washington Bullets fan Robin Ficker was the NBA's most prominent heckler. With season tickets behind the visiting team's bench, his antics were legendary. When he reminded Frank Layden of the Jazz that ""USA Today"" had rated him Worst Dressed Coach, Layden had to be restrained by security. With the Bulls in town, Ficker loudly read excerpts of Maverick, coach Phil Jackson's sex-laden 1975 autobiography. During the 1993 Suns-Bulls NBA Finals, Charles Barkley (of the Suns) flew Ficker to Phoenix and bought him a ticket behind the Chicago bench. Ficker was ejected in the first quarter. The Bullets became the Wizards in 1997 and moved into the MCI Center the following season. Ficker's new seats were not in shouting distance of the visiting team, forcing him into heckling retirement. Last year he received 9.5% of the vote in a losing bid for Montgomery County Executive. 5. Kim Jong-il . That's right, the world's most feared dictator is a hoops junkie. During a 2000 visit, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented him a basketball signed by Michael Jordan. The Chicago Bulls are the favorite team of Kim Jong-il, who reportedly has a video library with every game Jordan ever played. At 5'3"", the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army is roughly the same height as Muggsy Bogues. 6. David Letterman's Stalker . David Letterman's biggest fan was also his biggest headache. When she was arrested for stealing Dave's Porsche in 1988, Margaret Ray told police she was Mrs. Letterman. She was a frequent trespasser on Dave's estate, once camping out on his tennis court. Ray's antics made her a regular monologue target. But the jokes stopped in 1998, when Ray jumped in front of a moving train. The collective guilt spread when we learned she was schizophrenic, as were her two brothers, who also committed suicide. 7. Joe from Saddle River . A die-hard Jets, Mets and Rangers fan, Joe Benigno was a frequent caller to WFAN, New York's all-sports radio station. Benigno won the station's Fan Appreciation Day contest in 1994, earning a chance to guest-host his own show. By 1995, Joe was WFAN's overnight guy, a title he held for almost a decade. In 2004, he was deemed ready for daytime and given the 10 a.m.-1p.m. timeslot. For all the lonely and passionate talk radio callers out there, Joe gives hope. 8. Steffi Graf's biggest fanatic . Deranged and obsessed with seeing Steffi Graf return to the top of the rankings, Gunter Parche stabbed Monica Seles during a 1993 match in one of the most disturbing incidents in sports history. Almost as disturbing was his punishment. Parche received a two-year suspended sentence and was ordered to attend mandatory counseling. Even more shocking, I can't find footage of any of this on YouTube. Also receiving votes:  John Hinckley; the fan who started the Pistons-Pacers brawl in 2004; Jeffrey Maier; The Kissing Bandit; ""Butch"" from Middlebury; Metallica superfan-turned-bass player Jason Newstead; and Steve Bartman.

3,"(CNN) -- Why do we watch? Bob Greene says athletes like Lebron James show us the difference between ordinary effort and excellence. The question applies not just to Sunday's NBA All-Star Game, although that is the immediate case in point. The outcome of the game is not important -- few people remember who wins the All-Star Game from year to year. The players, while attempting to win, do it with barely concealed smiles on their faces. All-Star weekend is mostly a class reunion for basketball's elite. But all the games, in all the seasons, in all the big-time sports leagues -- what is the real reason we keep on watching? You might think that we'd finally grow weary of caring, with headlines about Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds, with the sports pages often reading like the business pages (contract disputes and stadium bond-issue negotiations and salary arbitration), with police-blotter details sometimes pushing aside the box scores. Why do we watch? The answer may be found in a single sentence written by a man who died at the age of 76 in this still-new year. John Updike, his literary brilliance aside, was prolific almost beyond belief -- he wrote more than 50 books, and hundreds upon hundreds of essays, short stories, articles, poems and works of criticism. All those careful words, year after year, decade after decade. But of all the sentences Updike ever wrote, there is one that I have long encouraged people to carry around with them -- if not literally tucked into their wallets, then somewhere in their heads and in their hearts. In that sentence of Updike's lies the secret to a lot of things -- including the secret that answers: Why do we watch? The sentence appeared in Updike's 1960 nonfiction piece about Ted Williams's last game for the Boston Red Sox. That piece is famous for how Updike explained Williams's refusal to come out of the dugout and acknowledge the cheering, crying fans after his home run in his final at-bat: ""Gods do not answer letters."" But it is another sentence in the story that explains everything -- not just about sports, but about the lives the rest of us can lead. Referring to Ted Williams, Updike wrote: . ""For me, Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill."" There it is, right there. That tissue-thin difference, when you don't necessarily know anyone is watching -- there is the answer. We all face the choice in our lives every day: to make the extra effort or not, to stay at the desk for the extra fifteen minutes or to go home, to revise the project one more time before handing it in or to settle for something acceptable, if not quite excellent. On fields of play -- baseball diamonds, football fields, a basketball court like the one on which Sunday's All-Star Game will be held -- the tissue-thin difference is there for the world to see. The lights are dazzlingly bright; the television cameras carry the close-ups around the globe. If a player is dogging it, we can tell; if a player is jogging instead of sprinting, it's self-evident; if a player's mind is already at the party that will be held after the final buzzer, we know. Yet once in a while -- we can see it in a player's eyes -- we are rewarded. Once in a while, sometimes when we are least expecting to witness it, it's there: a tiny move, an all-but-imperceptible lunge, an additional thrust, a reach beyond that which should by all reason be reachable. It was true during small and glorious moments in the days when Bob Cousy and Elgin Baylor were on the basketball court; it is true during small and glorious moments today, when Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are on the court. Updike's tissue-thin difference. A thing done well, when the player could have gotten away with a thing done ill. Are the rest of us the same as the players on the court? In most ways, no. We lack their athletic skill, their physical grace, their monetary riches. They hear cheers every working night; we toil in silence. And yet, the one way in which we can be the same, or at least strive to, is in that pursuit of the tissue-thin difference. The thing that makes the best of them different is the thing that offers us, too, the potential to earn that difference -- the effort beyond mere effort, the desire beyond standard-issue desire, the pride so strong that it becomes the definition of pride. Why do we watch? We watch for those moments. They may be fleeting; they may come and go so quickly we're not even certain, for an instant, that we actually saw them. But they're real, and they can be ours. We wait for them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.",0.7003756,1734
4,"(CNN)  -- Baseball's biggest stars are in New York for Tuesday's All-Star game, as the sport says goodbye to one of its most famous landmarks. Joseph Cornacchia, left, used to play with Babe Ruth when he was a kid, his son Jim says. It's the Yankees' final season at the ""House that Ruth Built,"" and MLB.com reports that 40 Hall of Famers are expected to attend the historic event. We asked CNN.com readers to share their baseball memories and to tell us about meeting their favorite players. iReporter Jim Cornacchia of Rye, New York, says his grandmother taught Babe Ruth to ""make a mean batch of chili."" He said the legendary slugger would come to  Greenwood Lake, New York, during the off season and would visit with his family. iReport.com: Ever met your favorite player? Cornacchia's father, Joseph, who just turned 76, would play wintertime games with ""The Babe"" as a child, and even built a snowman with him. Patrick Palmer, 43, has been a Yankees fan since he was a kid, even though he grew up in Iowa. ""My father was a Yankees fan, and it was just handed down through the generations,"" he said. Palmer has a baseball signed by about 20 Yankees players and other memorabilia, but said his biggest thrill was meeting relief pitchers Sparky Lyle and Rich ""Goose"" Gossage. ""It was also amazing to shake hands with one of the most feared pitchers of his day, Goose Gossage, and really see what a gentle person he could be,"" See what Palmer wrote on iReport.com. New Yorker Matthew Friedman said he met Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg last August after singing ""God Bless America"" before a Peoria Chiefs minor league game. Friedman was in town as part of the Broadway touring production of ""Movin' Out."" He said he would sing at the game only if he could meet Sandberg, who was managing the Chiefs. ""He was such a nice guy,"" he said. Friedman is a Mets fan, but said the Cubs legend was ""the kind of player I thought other players should be."" He said it was a meeting he'll never forget, and one he'll tell his children about again, and again, and again. ""I have a child on the way,"" he said. ""I can't wait."" Meeting a childhood hero was a test of courage for many young fans. iReporter thedeke almost didn't get to shake slugger Roger Maris' hand during a trip to Yankee Stadium as a 10-year-old. ""He was only 3 kids from me when he turned and started for the field,"" he wrote.  ""Why I said what I did, I will never know, but I actually yelled at Roger saying, 'Roger Maris! Don't you dare walk away with out shaking my hand!' "" Maris smiled, walked up to him and ""grabbed my hand with both of his and without saying a word he gave me a wink and off he went,"" thedeke wrote. Phil Miller was a 17-year-old bat boy for the Tacoma Rainiers in 1995 when he got to meet star outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. Griffey was playing for the Seattle Mariners at the time and was in the minor leagues while he was recovering from a wrist injury. Chasing fly balls Griffey hit during batting practice is something Miller said he will never forget. ""I wish I could freeze time and relive that 15 minutes over and over,"" he wrote. Miller was nervous about talking to Griffey in the locker room, but he said he broke the ice by asking him about his wife's pregnancy -- news that wasn't out yet. Griffey laughed when he found out his mother-in-law had shared the news with Miller's mom in a Tacoma hair salon, Miller said. Even baseball's most controversial figures provide fond memories. Kenny Lucas met Barry Bonds, the all-time leading home run hitter, in 2006 at a Colorado Rockies game. The former Giants star has been dogged by steroid allegations and has a reputation for being difficult, but Lucas said ""he was a very cool guy."" ""I used to think of Barry as another arrogant athlete, but he treated me as an equal and invited me into his conversation,"" Lucas said. iReporter natsmom24 met Pete Rose at a golf course when he was 11 years old. In 1991, Rose and other members of the Cincinnati Reds were at a golf course near his house, so natsmom24 tried to get some autographs. Several players ignored him and walked past, but he said Rose approached him and asked to sign his ball. He talked to him and then took him to the clubhouse and bought him a Snickers and a Coke. ""I was on top of the world! I was hanging out with Pete Rose! The Hit King! Charlie Hustle! No one was going to believe me when I told them this,"" he wrote.

6,"LONDON, England  -- American basketball is planning to create up to five new European franchises who would compete for the NBA Championship, according to a report by Sports Illustrated. NBA stars such as Kobe Bryant may soon be seen on a regular basis in Europe. The astonishing claims come hard on the heels of plans by the football's English Premier League to play matches overseas and underline the growing trend of globalization in major sports leagues. This was further evidenced by Super Bowl champions New York Giants playing a regular NFL season game against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London, but the NBA's leaked plans go far beyond that. A report on the Sports Illustrated Web site, says NBA commisioner David Stern will reveal his proposals on the eve of the All-Star Game in New Orleans this weekend. The plans are understood to include the formation of a European division with five new teams in major markets. The teams would play a full 82-game schedule and compete for the NBA championship. It is not the first time that Stern has entertained the concept of overseas expansion. He broached the idea in 2003, saying at the time that the league would look into European expansion within a decade. Those plans were scrapped, however, with the NBA instead focusing on developing its relationship with China and other emerging basketball markets. The number of European and overseas players has steadily increased in the NBA and basketball enjoys a particularly high profile in Spain, France, Italy, Greece and the Balkans. The NBA has played regular-season games in Japan and Mexico, and played exhibition contests this season in London and Rome. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is doubtful for Sunday's All-Star game with a damaged finger. Bryant, who dislocated his right pinkie last week, scored 29 points in 35 minutes in Wednesday's 117-92 win at Minnesota. Bryant sat out the fourth quarter and had the finger X-rayed after the game.

7,"Editor's note: CNN.com's Wayne Drash writes about his maniacal love for University of Memphis basketball. Memphis, North Carolina, UCLA and Kansas play in the Final Four this weekend. Drash says the Memphis team can help heal the city's old wounds. CNN.com's Wayne Drash, left, says he's been hooked on University of Memphis basketball since he was a kid. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- My love for University of Memphis basketball is completely irrational. I never went to school there and have no affiliation with the university. But I bleed Tiger blue. My dad used to take my brothers and me to Memphis games as a kid, and I've been hooked ever since. We once bought tickets from a scalper for six bucks apiece against arch-rival the University of Louisville in the 1980s. My dad complained we paid too much. But then we moved in seventh grade. I became an even bigger fan after we left the city. I'd huddle over my AM radio, hooked up with a coat hanger wrapped in aluminum foil as an antenna. More than 350 miles away, I managed to pick up the then-Memphis State games through the crackle and static of the radio. Memphis basketball was my only way to remain connected to my youth and the city that I loved. That was 1985, the last time Memphis made the Final Four. Is your team in the Final Four? Send your iReport celebratory photos . Back then, Memphis was led by a phenom named Keith Lee. He was best known for a sweet baseline jumper as soft as the nylon nets he swished. He was also known for his giant Afro. He was listed as 6 feet 10 inches. The joke was if you included his wild hairdo, he was 7-4. When my parents were away at work, sometimes I'd sneak into my mom's cabinet, steal her mousse and then put it in my hair. Then this white kid would go out back and shoot hoops for hours, hair sticking straight out like I stuck my finger in a socket. It was the only way I could be like Lee, my hero and idol. Back then, Memphians would rank Lee right up there with Elvis Presley as the city's most popular icons. Many still do. And that's the thing about Tiger basketball. In a place where race has often divided so much of it, Memphis basketball has helped unite the city. As a boy, white and black kids would crowd the basketball court at Tiger games to try to snatch the players' sweatbands as they raced into the locker room. Up until I graduated from high school, the sweatbands of Phillip ""Doom"" Haynes and Baskerville ""Batman"" Holmes sat on my shelf in my room. Like a fan of any team, there have been good and bad times over the years. But sometimes the pain of being a Tiger fan is that much greater. Tragedy and heartbreak are part of it, such as  when Holmes killed his girlfriend and then himself in 1997. Other players, such as Aaron Price and A. Maceo Battle, have died far too young along the way, furthering the pain of being a fan. Larry Finch -- who as a black player brought together the city and took Memphis to its only national championship game in 1973, and later became one of its greatest coaches -- has lived much of the past few years in a rehabilitation center after suffering severe strokes. In some ways, that's what makes Memphis basketball so special. Memphis players embody the real life of so many Americans, many faced with extreme hard times. Some succeed; some don't. Others, such as Finch, keep on fighting. I don't find it an accident that Memphis is now seeking history the same week of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""I think Dr. King would find this a source of joy,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson told the team this week, according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper. A city that has seen so much pain, so much heartache, has something huge to celebrate -- all revolving around young college kids and a bouncy orange ball. The adage is that sports often have the ability to transcend the moment. This is one of those times. To get to the championship game Monday night, Memphis must first get past UCLA, the same team that defeated it in that 1973 title game. While much of the rest of the nation has the team pegged to lose, the Tigers -- for one shining moment -- have a chance to do something really special. They'd have it no other way. As for me? I won't be listening on my old radio, but this weekend I might just try sporting that 'do like Keith Lee. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of the writers.

8,"DETROIT, Michigan (CNN) -- It's a stimulus plan on sneakers. The NCAA men's Final Four at Detroit's Ford Field could generate $30 million to $50 million from visitors. The NCAA men's basketball Final Four couldn't come at a better time for the city of Detroit -- the hard-hit capital of the U.S. auto industry at the center of the state of Michigan's economic woes. The 12-percent unemployment rate here is the highest in the nation, and with the Big Three automakers all needing multibillion-dollar government bailouts in an attempt to stay afloat, the future isn't much brighter, some say. ""We need some help,"" said Detroit resident Mark Franklin, who took his 5-year-old son to Friday's Hershey's College All-Star Game at Ford Field. ""There are too many people out of work already. Even if you have a job, you know someone who doesn't."" Enter the Final Four and a quartet of powerhouse college basketball teams -- all seeking NCAA brass. Connecticut, Michigan State, North Carolina and Villanova have won a combined nine NCAA championships and reached 31 Final Fours. But more important to the city are the visitors -- and the wallets -- that college basketball's marquee weekend will bring to Detroit. City leaders expect 100,000 fans to visit -- staying in hotel rooms, renting cars and spending an anticipated $30 million to $50 million. The participation of Michigan State adds icing on the cake. The school's campus sits just 90 miles away, in East Lansing, giving the Spartans a home-floor advantage as they give locals some added pride on a special weekend. MSU helped things along mightily by advancing to the finals Saturday, defeating Connecticut 82-73. In the national championship game, the Spartans will play North Carolina, 83-69 victors over Villanova later Saturday. More than half the Michigan State players are from in-state and many have felt the impact of the region's economic woes. ""I have family that are unemployed right now,"" said sophomore guard Durrell Summers, who starred at Detroit's Redford Covenant High School. ""[For the Final Four] to bring that kind of money in, hopefully it can help open up jobs for my family and for other families because some people got laid off for no reason."" Watch Elaine Quijano's report on a GM dealer's perspective . Detroit's first Final Four is the latest in a series of big sporting events for the city. The Pistons have hosted a pair of NBA Finals in suburban Auburn Hills, while the NHL's Red Wings have won two Stanley Cups at downtown Joe Louis Arena. Baseball's Tigers have played in a World Series and its home, Comerica Park, hosted an MLB All-Star game. This weekend's host venue, Ford Field, was the site of Super Bowl XL and Oakland Hills Country Club was home to the 2004 Ryder Cup and the PGA Championship last August in nearby Bloomfield Hills. This is the first year of a new stadium configuration for the Final Four, requiring host domes to use all permanent seating to meet a 70,000-seat minimum. ""You see people driving up just to take a picture of the Final Four sign on (Ford Field). It's something to be proud of,"" Franklin said. ""Now we need city leaders to take advantage of it.""",0.6899166,5126
9,"(CNN) -- When pitcher Josh Faiola walks out of the dugout on opening day with the Lake Erie Crushers, he'll already have a large group of fans in the stands -- his new roommates at the Belvedere of Westlake assisted living facility. Pitcher Josh Failoa stands as residents and friends of The Belvedere of Westlake welcome him Tuesday. The 25-year-old, who was drafted in 2006 by the Baltimore Orioles and is trying to work his way to the majors, admits he was caught a little off guard when he was told about his new housing situation. ""At first I was like, 'OK, that's a little different,' "" he said. ""I was taken aback at first."" And he was also the butt of a couple jokes from his teammates. ""They were saying things like 'So what's the deal? Do you have to go to bed early?' "" Faiola said. But then he told them about his room -- a large suite, with his own kitchenette, washer and dryer, furniture and a TV. ""Then they changed their tune,"" he said. ""They were like 'That's awesome. Are they any other vacancies?' "" Like many of the players in the independent Frontier League who don't rake in the big bucks, Faiola is living with a host family. But his host family is a little different. Most of the players live with families with younger children. But in his case, Faiola is the young one -- about 55 years younger than the rest of his ""roommates."" Eighty-four-year-old Meda Dennis, who has been living in the center for four years, said Faiola's arrival is the most exciting thing to happen since a good Elvis impersonator showed up. ""It's been quite exciting because he's young and new and interesting and we're old,"" she joked. Faiola made his way to the assisted living center in Westlake, Ohio, near Cleveland, with the help of Cindy Griffiths-Novak. She heard the new local baseball team was looking for host families for the players. But because she has a 3- and 4-year-old at home, she turned to her family's assisted living center as an option for Faiola. Griffiths-Novak went to the residents with the idea and they unanimously voted for Faiola to live there. But his new housing situation is about more than just a place to crash after the game. ""It certainly is great for the residents because now we get a lot of energy and youth and excitement,"" Griffiths-Novak said. It has turned into an exciting time for the residents, who jumped at the chance to decorate the entire facility before the pitcher's arrival. ""You should see the decorations,"" Griffiths-Novak said. ""The residents all signed motivational good luck pennants for him, there's a 40-foot banner, we have a whole thing dedicated to Josh. I'm sure he is so embarrassed with all of the baseball cards with their face on it."" They've made signs telling him he's in a league of his own, but they've also set their expectations high for him. ""Some of the pendants say things like 'Don't get cut, move your butt,' "" Griffiths-Novak said. ""He's certainly going to be under the microscope! We'll be watching and keeping track of all of his stats."" Faiola was awestruck when he walked in and saw all of the decorations. The activity director has been doing craft activities with the residents -- making visors with baseball logos and Crushers necklaces in anticipation of the game. Dennis is looking forward to watching their new ace pitcher hit the mound even though she hasn't seen a baseball game live in a while. ""Anything's better than the Indians right now,"" Dennis joked. ""We'll definitely be cheering for him, though, and if he happens to have a bad game, he'll have a lot of shoulders to cry on. But I don't think he'll need them."" Norma J. Lane, 85, said even though she's more of a football fan, she's looking forward to following Faiola and baseball more closely. ""We are just wishing him well because it's such a great experience for all of us,"" Lane said. ""We're looking forward to having him around."" Faiola said he is excited to help bring some fun to the residents, some of whom are already considering him to be like a grandson. ""I always loved spending time with my grandparents and one of my great-grandparents was in an assisted living home and I remember how excited she was to see us when we went to visit her,"" he said. ""And they are being so nice to open up this place to me, so hopefully I can bring a little bit of joy."" Faiola, who had surgery two years ago and was dropped from the Orioles during spring training, is hoping his stint with the Crushers can help get him picked up by a Major League team. Regardless of what happens, he knows he has the support of his new roommates. ""They've all really come out and supported me, they even bring me food and give me snacks,"" he said. ""I couldn't ask for anything better. And with all of them watching so closely, I'll have to keep my game up. They've definitely set a high bar for me.""",0.6845058,3790
10,"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose current book is ""When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams."" Bob Greene says John Madden has had a great perk: seeing America on his own bus. (CNN) -- You've undoubtedly heard that John Madden has left the football broadcast booth. What you may not have heard is that he's not leaving his bus. ""It's been such a great ride,"" Madden said as he announced his retirement. But the truly great ride -- the one he will not relinquish -- wasn't his long career as a National Football League broadcaster. The best ride was the literal one. Madden's aversion to flying in airplanes led him to perhaps the grandest business perk in all of American life: He was given his own bus, with his own professional drivers. He crisscrossed the country, on his way from one big game to another, on what came to be known as the Maddencruiser, the cost of which eventually was underwritten by corporate sponsorship. Now. . .you may think that being stuck in a bus for days and nights on end must be a lousy way to lead a life. Not when you're the only passenger -- you, or whatever buddies and colleagues you choose to invite along. Not when there's food and drink onboard, and television sets with DVD players at the ready, and plenty of room to stretch out and observe the country as it passes by. And those amenities leave out the most beautiful lure of all. Let President Obama explain it. He did, inadvertently, the other week. He wasn't talking about Madden -- he was talking about plans for a new high-speed rail system. These were the president's words: . ""No racing to an airport and across a terminal, no delays, no sitting on the tarmac, no lost luggage, no taking off your shoes [at the metal detector]. . . . "" That's the gift Madden gave himself, by working out the bus deal -- the gift of avoiding the endless headaches of travel the rest of the world has to endure. Departure time? Whenever he wants. Flight cancellations? No such thing. Cramped seats? Nope. Security lines? There are none. It can make for a pretty peaceful life. A football game to see every week, the country winding gloriously out ahead of you between stadiums, your main decision boiling down to how to chop up the miles, where to eat and where to sleep and where to stop for a few hours just to talk to people. . . . There is a hotel on the west coast of Florida where I have stayed quite often, and during football season Madden would sometimes stay there too. If there had been a game in, say, Miami, and the next one was in Dallas, he might ask his bus driver to stop for the night at this place, which features outlying cottages on the Gulf of Mexico. Talk about a guy who seemed tranquil -- I know his on-air image was always sort of loud and animated, but I'd see Madden having a serenely silent and unhurried meal by himself in the restaurant, leisurely flipping through the sports pages; I'd see him in the little sandwich shop/deli in the morning, a quiet and amiable fellow standing in line with everyone else, waiting to pay for his breakfast pastries; I'd see him, on departure day, strolling blissfully toward his bus, an overnight bag in his hand, having decided that this was the time that he'd like to roll out. . . . Who would ever have thought that a fantasy life could revolve around something as seemingly mundane as a bus? But in a chaotic and confused world, full of noise and anger and deadlines, the allure of cruising in splendid solitude through the country, seeing America mile by mile, the journey itself being the ultimate victory. . . . Madden is the grand champion of bus riders, the winner of the lifetime achievement award. And for those who thought that Madden must have felt trapped on that bus for all these years, the truth -- I can promise you this -- is that rolling through the country that way is the opposite of being trapped. The highway begins to feel like a best friend; as well as you may have thought you knew America before, you begin to understand it in ways you never even considered. Block by block, town by town, state by state, you appreciate anew: There are still so many things to see. So I wasn't surprised when Madden, after declaring that the football life he is leaving had been a great ride, said that, by the way, he's keeping the bus. When he travels, that's how he will do it, with or without a corporate sponsor, even now that there will be no game waiting on the other end. And of course, after all these years there is a certain remarkable aura that has formed around the man and that bus of his. At the place in Florida where he would sometimes stay, I was coming back from dinner one night and saw two local police squad cars on the property. This was highly unusual; the town was a quiet dot on the map. I asked the police officers if there had been a crime committed. They appeared a little sheepish. They exchanged glances, as if deciding whether to tell me their real reason for being there. Finally one of them laughed, and said: . ""We just wanted to look at John Madden.""

11,"(CNN) -- The New York Giants' unlikely win over the New England Patriots is already being called one of the biggest shockers in Super Bowl history, and the amazing catch David Tyree made to set up the game-winning touchdown won't be forgotten anytime soon. Pint-sized Giants fans, Luka and Kristian Radovich, celebrate after Plaxico Burress' game-winning catch. CNN.com reader Michael Heitman, of Baxter, Tennessee, will remember Super Bowl XLII for more than the 17-14 score. ""Our 13-month-old daughter took her first steps during the second half. Apparently, so did the Giants offense. Congrats to the Giants from a Cowboys fan,"" he said. David Marks, of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, said it was ""one of the best football games I'd ever seen,"" but said watching the game with his family had some drawbacks. ""I was not able to enjoy the commercials as much because my mom wouldn't stop yakking away,"" he said. ""She's 80 years old and I didn't want to say anything at first -- you don't know how much longer you have your mom at that age. But finally after a quarter and a half, I had to ask her to pipe down.""  Watch some of the pre-game festivities » . Dan Nash, of Santa Monica, California, didn't have that problem. ""It would be nice to see the GAME a little more,"" he said adding that ""every 10 seconds (or less), we're watching ads! Kickoff ... three ads. Punt ... three ads. Flag on the play ... two ads."" Here is a sampling of our readers' reaction to the game: . Russell Giuliano of Middletown, New Jersey I have seen every Super Bowl, and this was the best ever, even better than No. 3 with Namath. Dave Viscusi of Schenectady, New York That was one of the best Super Bowls/Super Bowl parties I have ever been to. We made 4 different kinds of pizza (BBQ chicken, cheese, sausage and peppers), boneless buffalo wings, BBQ ribs, chips of all kinds, apple martinis, some beer and topped off the Giants victory with some CHAMPAGNE! GO G-Men ... Eli deserves every ounce of credit he gets for this Super Bowl ... Way to throw it right in the arrogant Patriots' face! Ricardo Gomez of Buenos Aires, Argentina I'm a big Pats fan, and I was sad to see that last play when Manning escapes the Pats' defense and throw that pass, the one that put the GIANTS OFFENSE so close to the touchdown. Anyway, I think Pats are still the best team in the league, and I was there that snowy night when Brady got us to the Super Bowl at the last second with (Adam Vinatieri kicking) that amazing field goal! So GO PATS! GO!!! Irving Horowitz of Princeton, New Jersey There are three sport moments in my life that I will take to my grave with a broad grin and deep pleasure: The first was the Bobby Thompson home run for the New York (Baseball) Giants in 1951 to defeat the Dodgers; a varsity game while I was at Hobart & William Smith when, as a member of the faculty and staff, we defeated a first-class varsity team in 1962 and I made the winning basket with 28 seconds on the clock (I have the press clippings to prove this); and the biggest thrill of them all: Watching the New York (Football) Giants win Super Bowl XLII against the New England Patriots. When Bob Tisch spoke of ""this win is for all Giant fans who, for the past 30 years, supported the team at Giants Stadium, and before that at the Yankee Stadium, and for those who still remember being part of the Giants at the Polo Grounds,"" I felt that he spoke directly to me. After all, I am actually about a year or two older than the franchise ... Wow! 2008 is already a good year -- a good omen for America. Monique Mondesire of Bronx, New York I'm a 26-year-old female who really doesn't put much thought into sports, but that was the best Super Bowl game I have ever seen in my life. I had faith that it would happen, but the way it happened was priceless. I'm very proud to be a New Yorker and a new Giants fan. To all the New Yorkers that lost their bets yesterday, in the words of Don Corleone, ""Never go against the family."" Lisa Ciacci of Brooklyn, New York As a die-hard Cowboys fan, I may have been the most unlikely N.Y. Giants fan last night. I could not be happier for this team. They played their hearts out in quite possibly the best game I have ever watched. Eli Manning came of age before our very eyes and proves once again that he is truly a class act. I hope this loss haunts the Patriots forever. They weren't good enough to beat the Giants last night nor will they ever be. This city will surely explode at tomorrow's parade -- it's good to be in New York! GO GIANTS! E-mail to a friend .",0.68103284,942
12,"(CNN) -- Jennifer Valdivia scooped up the baseball after it sailed into the right-field stands. The 12-year-old smiled and giggled over the keepsake from her first Major League ballgame. Jennifer Valdivia, 12, holds the record-setting baseball after it was returned this week to her. She'd have to sue to get the ball back. This is the story of a baseball and the big leagues, of a young girl, a slugger and a lawsuit. It's about another stain on America's pastime -- commercialism colliding with a kid's innocent joy. Jennifer's big catch was the 200th home run for Ryan Howard, an All-Star for the Philadelphia Phillies. The 29-year-old first baseman achieved the milestone faster than any player in Major League history, in his 658th career game, 48 fewer games than the previous record. The ballclub wanted to give the ball to its star player. And that's where things got complicated.  Watch Jennifer smile as ball is returned » . It was mid-July. The Phillies squared off against the Florida Marlins at Land Shark Stadium near Miami. Jennifer was in the stands with her 69-year-old grandfather, her 17-year-old brother and one of his friends. Howard launched his history-making homer in the sixth inning, a solo shot to right field. The sixth-grader beat her older brother to the ball. Nearby, fans said they couldn't believe a girl came away with the prize. ""I was rubbing it in my brother's face,"" Jennifer later recalled. He'd been to many games before, but had never caught a homer ball. ""I got a ball and you didn't,"" she teased. Switcheroo leaves mom steaming . Excitedly, Jennifer called her mom on the phone. ""Mom, I got the ball!"" Moments later, the Marlins sent a team representative to the stands. Jennifer and her brother, Gian Carlos, were escorted to the Phillies' clubhouse. Their grandfather, a Cuban immigrant who doesn't speak English, stayed in his seat. A Phillies employee, Jennifer says, told her if she handed over the ball, she could come back after the game, meet the slugger and get him to autograph it. She gave the ball up. In exchange, she got cotton candy and a soda. Jennifer went back to her seat but returned to the clubhouse after the game -- this time, with her grandfather and the rest of her party. They waited. The Phillies slugger never showed up. A security guard walked up and gave Jennifer a ball autographed by Howard. But it wasn't the one she caught. This ball was clean and polished. Jennifer calls it ""the fake one."" ""I was, like, really sad."" Howard told reporters after the game that he was proud of his feat. He eclipsed Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner, who played on three teams from 1946 to 1955. Kiner's record had stood for more than a half-century. ""It's a nice record to have,"" Howard said. ""I'll take it and run with it."" When Jennifer's mother, Delfa Vanegas, got wind of what happened, she wasn't happy. She grilled her daughter about giving up the prized possession. ""What do you want me to do, Mom?"" Jennifer said. ""They were asking for the ball."" Vanegas' motherly instinct kicked in. She felt her daughter had been duped, robbed of something potentially worth thousands of dollars. ""It's my daughter,"" the steamed mom says. ""It's my blood."" She contacted the Phillies and asked for the ball. In baseball parlance, the Phillies balked. But the team did offer to give the family VIP tickets the next time they played in Florida. ""I don't want tickets,"" Vanegas replied. ""I want the ball back."" Entering the batter's box: attorney Norm Kent. He first approached the Phillies in July with his simple demand: Give the girl her ball. True value, and memories . Letting fans keep the home-run balls they catch is a time-honored tradition. It's a way for ordinary fans to connect with the superstars -- and to cash in on the catch if history has been made. When Salvatore Durante snagged Roger Maris' 61st home-run ball -- the one that broke Babe Ruth's single season home-run record in 1961 -- his life changed forever. Durante offered to give it to Maris, but the Yankees slugger declined. ""He said: 'Keep the baseball and try to make some money with it,'"" Durante once told the Baltimore Sun. He sold it for $5,000 -- what amounted to a year-and-a-half's salary for Durante. See where historic baseballs are now . Howard's ball is small potatoes in the world of sports memorabilia, maybe worth a couple thousand bucks on the open market. But it's hugely sentimental to the player -- and to the girl who caught it at her first ballgame. So, Kent's efforts to get the ball back for his young client met with resistance. There was no way of knowing ""with any degree of certainty whether the ball delivered was in fact the home-run ball,"" Phillies attorney William Webb wrote in a brush-back letter dated August 6. If the girl wants the baseball, Webb continued, contact Howard's agent, ""since the player now has the ball."" By Monday of this week, with the regular season over and no ball in hand, Kent took the extraordinary measure of suing on behalf of Jennifer. He sought the ball and a judgment ""in excess of $15,000."" The ball was promptly returned. ""Ryan Howard 200th career home run,"" it says in capital letters across the ball, now encased. ""My ball,"" Jennifer says with a smile. The Phillies, in the middle of a pitched playoff battle, have declined comment on the ball brouhaha. Howard's agent, Terry Prince, told CNN affiliate WSVN: ""He's willing to give the ball back to her without any strings attached. Free of charge."" As part of the settlement, Kent said Howard and the Phillies agreed to pay his attorney fee, about $1,000. Jennifer has no plans to sell. She keeps the ball in her room, hidden near her bunk so friends can't take it. ""When I grow up and everything, I'm going to show it to my kids,"" said Jennifer, who wants to be a pediatrician. ""Then, they're going to tell their kids, and their kids are going to tell their other kids."" Her message to ballclubs and millionaire players? The next time a child catches a home-run ball, let the kid keep it. Or, if you're going to take it away, at least ask a parent first.",0.6784041,8492
13,"Hartford, Connecticut (CNN) -- Few defending champions in sport have had as much to defend as the University of Connecticut women's basketball team. On Tuesday night, the Huskies successfully defended their title (beating Stanford 53-47), their winning streak (78 games) and themselves (against the charge that they're ""bad"" for women's basketball). They are so much better than every other team, goes the argument of various scribes, yakkers and bloggers, that they've made a mockery of the game. Never mind that these very pundits have mocked the game for years. Perhaps that's UConn's real crime: It's made a mockery of others' mockery. I know. I once mocked women's basketball -- and thank God I did. After I'd written a single line casually ridiculing women's basketball in the pages of Sports Illustrated, a woman confronted me in a bar in New York. She asked me how many games I'd attended before forming my low opinion of the sport. My armpits burst into flames, and I said that I'd never actually been to a women's basketball game. She invited me to one, and 23 months later, I married that woman, Rebecca Lobo, who won a national championship with an unbeaten UConn team in 1995 and a gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and who helped to launch the WNBA in 1997 as a member of the New York Liberty. I'm not saying critics are wrong: Perhaps UConn is bad for the sport, the way Secretariat was bad for horse racing when he won the Belmont by 31 lengths, or the way the Beatles diminished pop music by releasing 20 No. 1 hits, or the way da Vinci's diversity of talents -- artist, engineer, inventor, etc. -- rendered the Renaissance irredeemably dull. Or perhaps exceptional talent and overriding excellence, over time, raises the level of everyone in its proximity, in which case this UConn team might be the best thing that ever happened to women's basketball. True, when the Huskies play, the outcome of every game is known in advance, much as the outcome of every Perry Mason case was known in advance. The fun lay in seeing how the inevitable victory happened -- in watching the genius at work. People knew going in that Houdini always escaped. They still watched, because the next time he might not. And so it goes for the Huskies, who trailed 20-12 after a hideous first half Tuesday night before slipping the padlocks and swimming to the surface, triumphant. People who play and appreciate extraordinary basketball recognize this dominance as an end unto itself. ""UConn has too many weapons,"" Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant said on Twitter last week. ""Best team ever in sports?"" Not many people can answer that question knowledgeably, because most people don't watch women's basketball. It can't help that the women's final is played between the men's national championship game and the Masters golf tournament. It's a subordinate clause between a giant pair of parentheses. Pity, because the 2009-10 UConn women are surely one of sports history's most dominant teams, one for whom losing is unfathomable. ""What if the UConn women lose?"" Minnesota Timberwolves guard Jonny Flynn asked on Twitter during the tournament. ""I hope not, because that means the end of the world is near."" He pleaded for the Huskies to save the planet -- or as Flynn put it: ""Win for Humanity."" Of course, the Huskies are not saving mankind. Or womankind. Or womynkind. Women's teams, unlike men's, are somehow required to carry the flag for their entire gender. They're ""empowering our daughters,"" they're sneaker-shod suffragettes. The UCLA men's team that won 88 consecutive games in the early 1970s weren't striking a blow for wearers of headbands or mutton-chop sideburns. The Chicago Bulls dynasty of the '90s was not empowering the rainbow-haired. Men's teams play and are appreciated on their own merits. We should be able to do the same with the UConn women. They don't have to be heroines or feminist icons. The epithet my wife most often uses to describe herself is ""tall chick."" That's what the UConn women are: Women -- some tall, some not -- playing very good basketball. It's pleasure enough to watch a bunch of shiny new parts working together, efficiently, toward a devastating end: the kind of beauty you see in a combine harvester as it threshes a field of wheat.

14,"(CNN) -- It's the season of brackets, beer and, of course, basketball. Duke Blue Devils fans cheer on their team at the ACC Tournament in Atlanta, Georgia. Come mid-March, the country falls sick with college basketball fever, and the NCAA Tournament is all the talk. As men's college basketball comes to a close with the last game April 6, fans are anxiously watching to see who will claim victory in this year's national championship game. More than a century after James Naismith invented basketball at a YMCA training school in Massachusetts, the sport continues to captivate millions of fans. Over the years, college basketball has sparked great dedication among its fans, from those who camp out for three months for a ticket to those who attended games before they could read. CNN, with the help of experts at the NCAA, chose a handful of basketball towns filled with great fans, rich traditions and history that make these places worth a visit. 1. Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill . College basketball is deeply rooted in North Carolina culture, thanks to the success of the men's teams at the University of North Carolina and Duke University. The epic rivalry between Duke's Blue Devils and North Carolina's Tar Heels draws in so many fans that some sports experts say it is partly responsible for reviving the waning college basketball viewership in the first half of this decade. Visitors will find that Duke basketball fans don't shower their support only on game day. At Duke University -- seeded No. 2 in the East -- student fans, dubbed the Cameron Crazies, are so eager to snare one of the 1,200 first-come-first-serve spots in the Cameron Stadium student section that they camp out for up to three months for the infamous North Carolina-Duke matchup. The grassy tenting area outside the basketball arena, known as Krzyzewskiville, is named after Coach Mike Krzyzewski, who has been named National Coach of the Year 12 times. ""It's so easy to become enthralled with the culture of Duke basketball,"" said Joel Burrill, a senior who headed up the tenting efforts this year. Outside the stadium, visitors will discover plenty of Blue Devil spirit off-campus in Durham, a former tobacco town. Satisfaction Restaurant and Charlie's Pub & Grille are among the favorite hot spots where visitors will discover student and local fans watching the games. About a 20-minute drive from Durham is the historic town of Chapel Hill, home to the University of North Carolina, which was seeded No. 1 in the South this year. The school has a strong record of basketball success, appearing in more than 40 NCAA tournaments. It is also the college team of professional basketball legend Michael Jordan. Adam Lucas, publisher of Tar Heel Monthly, has been decked in baby blue Carolina gear since he was a child. He even skipped school so he could attend the games with his parents, both Tar Heel alums. ""It's not just a sport,"" he explained. ""It's the number one thing talked about during this part of the year. You'll have trouble holding a conversation in Chapel Hill in March if you don't know the basics of Carolina basketball."" If visitors can't get one of the coveted tickets to watch the game in the Dean E. Smith Center, aka the Dean Dome, there is plenty to do in the quaint city of Chapel Hill. Visitors can walk to Franklin Street, the heart of town, where eateries, shops and sports bars are ready to embrace UNC fans. They can also visit the 8,000-square-foot Carolina Basketball Museum, located on campus, which holds more than 450 interactive displays, memorabilia and photos documenting a basketball program that began more than a century ago. 2. The University of Kansas in Lawrence . To understand the fan devotion for the defending national champions and a Midwest No. 3-seeded team this year, one must make a trip to Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. The Jayhawks' indoor arena is old-school -- smaller than most college basketball stadiums -- built in the 1950s and named in honor of revered former Coach Forrest C. ""Phog"" Allen. In 1952, ""Phog"" led the men's basketball team to its first NCAA victory. The energy from thousands of fans in Allen Field House is contagious. In addition to the ""Rock Chalk Jayhawk"" chant, KU students are famous for their clever antics against the other teams, particularly their longstanding rivals at the University of Missouri. But if you can't get a ticket during the regular season, check out the Booth Family Hall of Athletics, a 26,000-square-foot museum adjacent to the stadium. The museum, which opened about three years ago, houses artifacts and information about the history of KU athletics, including the men's basketball team. Visitors can head to colorful Massachusetts Street, the main drag in downtown Lawrence. The street is lined with plenty of restaurants and bars catering to Jayhawks followers on game day. When Kansas beat Memphis to clinch the national championship last year, more than 100,000 fans poured into the street, university officials say. ""People who come [to Lawrence] never want to leave,"" said Jennifer Sanner, a 1981 alumna and editor of Kansas Alumni magazine. ""And if you're a basketball fan, that's all the better."" 3. Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana . Sure, the Hoosiers didn't have a stellar season after going 6-25, and they didn't make it to the NCAA Tournament. After Kelvin Sampson resigned as coach in February over allegations that he had violated NCAA recruiting standards, the team lost many of its top players. Despite this, college basketball in Bloomington, Indiana, remains sacred, devout Hoosiers fans say, and they believe that the men's team will be back in full force over the next few years. Indiana University has one of the top basketball programs in the country, winning five NCAA championships. The team was led for many years by hot-tempered but incredibly successful coach Bobby Knight. If you are lucky enough to get a ticket to see the Hoosiers play at their stadium, Assembly Hall, you will find droves of student fans. Assembly Hall holds one of the country's largest student sections, holding more than 8,000. Officials at Bloomington Indiana Visitors & Convention Bureau say basketball game days flood local restaurants and bars with students and local fans. The games tend to sell out, so be prepared to explore Bloomington. Most fans head to Kirkwood Avenue near campus and drop by Nick's English Hut, where the walls are covered with Hoosiers athletic photographs and gear, or Yogi's Grill and Bar to watch the game. ""Basketball is a religion in this state,"" said Zach Osterman, the men's basketball columnist at the university's student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student. ""It goes way back before Bobby Knight. It's what people do up here."" 4. Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin . There is no football team at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That means students and alumni are even more dedicated to the men's basketball team, they say. Marquette may be a Jesuit university with just over 11,000 students, but it boasts one of the highest attendance rates at basketball games in the country. Students at Marquette don't pitch tents like at Duke, but the games are so popular, some will bring their sleeping bags 10 hours before the game to get the best seat in the house . ""It's such a great feeling to know you can walk anywhere in the city when you have a Marquette shirt on a basketball day and people will talk to you about basketball,"" said Sarah Dembkowski, a sophomore at the university. ""It gives this city a bonding feeling."" Although the West region No. 6-seeded Golden Eagles lost to the University of Missouri in the tournament last week, a trip to the Bradley Center, where the Marquette men's basketball team plays (and where the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play) is well worth the visit. Marquette students, called the Superfans, are famous for their peculiar behavior, dressing up in costumes to support their team and distracting opponents with oversized cutouts of celebrities' heads. On campus are several bars, including the Union Annex, that tout cheap beer pitchers and food specials for fans. Just several blocks from the university is downtown Milwaukee. On Water Street, where most of the fans crowd on game day, visitors can hang with the locals and enjoy a hub of sports bars, taverns and restaurants. 5. Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington . Gonzaga University officials call it the ""Gonzaga Effect"": This small private school in Spokane has qualified for the NCAA tournament for the 11th straight year. The Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team is an obscure team that seems to emerge from thin air each March. This year, the team entered the tournament seeded No. 4 in the South region. ""There have been a lot of one-and-done schools, who make a splash and disappear, but we've been able to sustain it,"" said Dale Goodwin, a spokesman for the university. Fans in ""the Kennel Club"" at Gonzaga go wild for basketball despite the school's smaller size. For more than 17 years of the Kennel Club's existence, the Bulldogs have won more than 75 percent of their games, including over 90 percent during the past eight seasons, according to the Gonzaga athletic department. Visitors will be delighted to watch the games in the school's arena, the $25 million McCarthey Athletic Center, which opened in 2004. Before the opening, the basketball team was playing in a glorified high school gym, university officials said. On Hamilton Street near the university, visitors will want to head to Jack & Dan's Tavern, which belongs to John Stockton, a former NBA and Gonzaga player. The Bulldog, which claims to have the best burgers in town, is also a popular hangout during the games. Meanwhile, the school is preparing to host the NCAA first- and second-round men's basketball tournament next March. The town of Spokane, tucked into eastern Washington, is excited to welcome visitors. A single event will probably bring in $2.75 million, according to the Spokane Regional Convention & Visitors Bureau.",0.67553174,2225
15,"(Mental Floss) -- Owning a professional sports franchise is my dream job. (I'm willing to relocate.) Of course, I could never afford my own team. There's a better chance I'll miraculously develop an unhittable slider, or learn to punt. NFL team owner Robert Kraft got his start in the paper business. You obviously must be exceedingly wealthy to become an owner. Did you ever wonder how all these people made all that money? I sure hope you did, because we went and did all this research. Here's a list of nine billionaire owners and how they built their fortunes. 1. Rich DeVos, Orlando Magic (NBA) In 1959, DeVos and high school friend Jay Van Andel started selling all-purpose cleaner. Their business grew to become Amway, which now brings in $6 billion each year under the ominous-sounding Alticor name. Whether you see Amway as an empowering direct sales company or a something resembling a cult, it sure was good to DeVos. Forbes estimates his wealth at $3.5 billion, making the paltry $85 million he spent on the Magic in 1991 a minor investment. 2. Robert L. Johnson, Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) Lower on my list of dream jobs is running a cable network that caters to urban youth. So I'm all kinds of envious of Robert L., who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001. His fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce, but Johnson's estimated net worth is still $1.1 billion. His resume is full of firsts  BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE. He was the first African-American billionaire in the U.S. And, in 2002, he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise. 3. Robert Kraft, New England Patriots (NFL) I'd never given it much thought, but I'd always assumed Kraft bought the Patriots with big cheese money he'd inherited. But Kraft got his start in the paper business. His wife, Myra, is the daughter of Massachusetts philanthropist Jacob Hiatt. After Kraft finished Harvard Business School, he went to work with his father-in-law's packaging company. In 1972, Kraft founded International Forest Products, which is now part of the Kraft Group -- a diversified collection of companies ranging from Gillette Stadium to the New England Revolution (Major League Soccer) to Carmel Container Systems (Israel's largest packaging plant). Kraft is seen as a savior in New England -- before he bought the team in 1994, the Pats seemed destined for relocation to St. Louis. Plus he's made them really, really good, winning three Super Bowls this decade. Another reason I'm so keen on owning a team is the access to foreign heads of state. In 2005, Kraft met Vladimir Putin, who walked off with one of Kraft's Super Bowl rings. Kraft now claims it was a gift, but that might just be what you say when a Russian leader steals your jewelry. Mental Floss: How ex-presidents and prime ministers make ends meet . 4. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Seattle Mariners (MLB) Despite America's strong resistance to Japanese ownership -- and despite his admitted lack of interest in baseball -- Hiroshi Yamauchi became majority owner of the Seattle Mariners in 1992. Yamauchi is the man credited with transforming Nintendo from playing-card company to video game giant. His 55-year tenure saw incredible growth. But that doesn't mean there weren't a few bumps along the way. Forays into instant rice, taxi service and short-stay hotels (also known as ""love hotels"") did not pan out. 5. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys (NFL) Jerry Jones built an oil empire in the early 1970s, striking gas in the first thirteen wells he drilled. His father had given him a head start; Pat Jones sold the Modern Security Life Insurance Company for millions. An undersized guard, Jones was captain of the 1965 Cotton Bowl-winning Arkansas Razorbacks. Future Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson was a teammate, and Johnson's successor, Barry Switzer, was a Razorbacks assistant. Jones bought the Cowboys for an estimated $140 million in 1989. He immediately made waves by firing Tom Landry -- the only coach in Cowboys history -- and replacing him with his college buddy (the aforementioned Jimmy Johnson, who was coaching the University of Miami). After a rocky 1-15 start in 1989, the Cowboys went on to win three Super Bowls in the 1990s.   Mental Floss: A brief history of stadium naming rights . 6. Malcolm Glazer, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFL), Manchester United (English Premier League) Malcolm Glazer inherited a small jewelry repair business from his father. But it was Malcolm's investments in Florida trailer parks that started his financial ascent. He went on to become president and CEO of First Allied Corporation, which now owns 6,700,000 square feet of retail space. He was also chairman of Gilbert/Robinson, Inc., which managed over 100 restaurants, including Houlihan's and Darryl's. Today, the Glazer family oversees strip malls and nursing homes throughout the land. Glazer also has a large stake in Zapata, an oil company founded by George H.W. Bush. Glazer made five previous attempts to join the elite ranks of NFL ownership, including a failed 1993 bid to bring an expansion team to Baltimore. The New York Times said Glazer had ""a reputation as a franchise window shopper, one who looks at virtually every team that comes up for sale."" But in 1995, he outbid George Steinbrenner for the downtrodden Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Under his leadership, the franchise was righted, earning a Super Bowl title in 2003. Glazer also bought Manchester United, and fans weren't exactly pleased. 7. Stanley Kroenke, Denver Nuggets (NBA), Colorado Avalanche (NHL), St. Louis Rams (NFL -- partial owner) Kroenke is a self-made man who also married mega-rich. He earned his estimated $2.1 billion fortune in real estate, developing shopping centers across the country. Then he went ahead and married a Walton -- Ann Walton. Sam's niece. She's worth another $3+ billion. A sports junkie, Kroenke also owns Major League Soccer franchise Colorado Rapids and a share in Premier League's Arsenal F.C. 8. Daniel Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers (NBA) With $5,000 he'd earned delivering pizzas -- and after a stint as a TV reporter -- the future Cavs owner started a small mortgage company called Rock Financial in 1985. In 1999, the company was bought by Intuit for $532 million. Three years later, Gilbert bought it back for $64 mil, renaming the company Quicken Loans. He purchased the Cavaliers for $375 mil in 2005. He also owns Fathead, which makes wall decals and tiresome ads. On the side, Gilbert is working to beat Michigan's steroid-free bench-pressing record. 9. Stephen Bisciotti, Baltimore Ravens (NFL) At 48, Stephen Bisciotti is one of the NFL's youngest owners. He made his money in staffing -- specifically, finding talented engineers for the aerospace industry. With Jim Davis, Bisciotti founded Aerotek in 1983 (he was 23). Their staffing company, now known as the Allegis Group, had revenues of $4.4 billion in 2005. Bisciotti bought 49 percent of the Ravens in 2000, and purchased the rest from Art Modell in 2004.

16,"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says Logan, Ohio, paid an extraordinary tribute to its most dedicated football fan. (CNN) -- ""Yes, it's all gone now,"" Craig Dunn told me the other day. ""If you're not from around here, you'd never know it was ever there."" Dunn is the sports editor of the Logan, Ohio, Daily News, a paper with a small circulation (around 4,000) and a small news staff (five people put the paper out, covering the entire county). Last fall, when I was crisscrossing the country on the CNN Election Express, I spoke with Dunn about the town's high school football stadium, which was being demolished. Bill Sauer Field, it was called. The story I wrote appeared briefly on the Political Ticker and then went away quickly; there was so much rapidly breaking news coming out of the presidential campaign that the story was little more than a blip. Yet I found myself, during the last year, thinking about Bill Sauer Field, and Logan, Ohio, and how it's possible for all of us, if we make the effort, to find the best in ourselves -- to find the best in each other. I find myself thinking about Bill Sauer, and about what that little town did for him, more than I think about almost anything else on which I reported during our long journey through America. And so, with a new football season beginning all across the United States, I spoke with Craig Dunn again the other afternoon. ""When I drive by the place where it used to be, it's not with a sense of sadness,"" he said. ""It's with pride for what this town once did."" Bill Sauer Field was the core of public life in Logan. The town, population 7,300, gravitated to the old stadium on Friday nights in autumns to watch the high school team, the Chieftains, play their games. And who was Bill Sauer? A self-made millionaire from the community who had bestowed the stadium upon the town? A prominent local politician? A long-gone Logan football hero? No. Bill Sauer was born in Logan more than 100 years ago -- in 1908. From the time he was a little boy, he could not walk. He spoke with great difficulty. His parents, desperate, searched for answers. Logan was and is a rural community, and back then sophisticated medical diagnoses were not easy to come by. His mother and father were eventually told that the boy had cerebral palsy. He attended public school in Logan. It was not easy, of course. He was 23 by the time he graduated from Logan High School. Then, as now, the boys who were strong and swift and athletically graceful were the ones most celebrated. Bill could not even take a step on his own. But he loved the Logan sports teams, and he took pride in supporting them. Football, basketball, track and field -- he never missed a game, and he seldom missed a practice session. He would be there on the sidelines, sitting in his wheelchair, cheering for his classmates. His life didn't get any less arduous after he graduated. His father died. It became incumbent upon Bill to support himself and his mother. He sold Christmas cards; he sold magazine subscriptions. At the town's swimming pool, he ran the concessions stand. His philosophy of life, Craig Dunn told me, was basic: However often you get knocked down, you get back up one more time. Bill Sauer grew older. New generations of healthy and talented young athletes played for the Logan Chieftains on Friday nights. No matter the weather, no matter how he was feeling, Bill was always there. The Logan football stadium had been constructed in 1925. It was the heart of the town; it was what made the community feel like a community. In 1975, there was a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the stadium. On that night, it was renamed. For him. For Bill. The whole town had fallen in love with him. All of the quarterbacks who had ever thrown touchdown passes in that stadium, all of the linebackers who had ever made jarring tackles, all of the field goal kickers who had ever won games for Logan as the scoreboard clock ticked down ... and the place was renamed for the boy who could never run a single stride. As the years went by, when visiting teams would come to town, few of the opposing players would have any idea why the stadium in Logan bore the name that it did. That didn't matter. Logan knew. Bill knew. He never married or had a family. He kept going to the games, sitting on the sidelines, right up until his death in 1988. The town, by honoring him the way it did, had given his life meaning, and contentment, and joy. The decades after his death passed; the stadium grew too old, too outmoded. Finally, by last year, there could be no more delay. It was time to tear down Bill Sauer Field. It has vanished now. The new athletic complex -- Logan Chieftain Stadium, it is called -- has risen out near State Route 328. Craig Dunn, the sports editor, spends his Friday nights in the fall covering the games there. Plans are in the works, he said, to erect a plaque at the new stadium in memory of the lifelong fortitude of the town's most faithful fan. ""They want the plaque to be in a place where the Logan players can see it as they run onto the field for every game,"" Dunn said. ""They want to make sure that Bill is never forgotten."" This can be a mean old world sometimes. But other times, when you least expect it, it can light you up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.",0.6696832,7009
17,"(CNN) -- If you've ever had a group of friends who have meant the world to you, take a look at the old black-and-white photo that accompanies today's column. If you've ever yearned to freeze time, to make the finest moments of your life stand still in their tracks so you can savor them a little longer, while knowing somewhere inside that such a thing is impossible, take a look at the faces of those three men. Not so many years before that photo was snapped, the three of them were inseparable -- not only on a basketball court, but in the minds of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of admirers. Their names routinely appeared in the same sentences in newspaper sports sections from coast to coast. They inhabited the same column of agate-type box scores on winter morning after winter morning. If you were young enough -- and, as the 12-year-old statistics kid who counted up their field goals, rebounds and free throws for the local Columbus, Ohio, television station that did the live broadcasts of their college games, I was young enough -- you allowed yourself to believe that the three friends would always be together. It wasn't to be. It almost never is, whether you are friends as famous as they were, or as anonymous as most of the rest of us are. Which is why I love that bittersweet photograph so much. It is an inadvertent record of a moment that signifies how all friends, eventually, must take different paths, that nothing beautiful is destined to endure uninterrupted. On the left in the photograph is Larry Siegfried of the Boston Celtics. In the center is Jerry Lucas of the Cincinnati Royals. On the right is John Havlicek of the Celtics. In 1960, the three had been teammates on The Ohio State University basketball team that won the national collegiate championship. It was quite a squad; the coach was Fred Taylor, the two other starters were Mel Nowell and Joe Roberts, and there was a sharpshooting forward who came off the bench, a rather intense young man by the name of Bobby Knight. The team was so smooth that, watching from the stands, you sensed they could read each others' minds. If you had never before quite understood what it looked like and felt like to be a part of a seamless unit, you found out every evening just by seeing them play. But the thing you could never really know -- the secret that belonged only to them, as it does with any group of friends -- was what it was like to be inside of it. They were separate people, but they were one. Which is why the photograph of them taken barely three years later -- it was shot on October 17, 1963, in the Cincinnati Gardens -- is, in its low-key way, so mesmerizing. The friends, because of circumstance, have parted. The paths have split. This was to be the first game during which, as professionals, they competed against each other. The old team was history. At the opening tipoff, their goals were about to diverge. The photo was snapped by a then-young man named Ed Keys, who had been taken to the game by his father, sportswriter Tom Keys. Ed Keys sent it to me recently because he thought I would understand. Fifty winters ago -- the winter that Lucas and Havlicek and Siegfried and their Ohio State teammates won their national championship -- I somehow, as a junior high school student who wasn't even that good at math, talked the local television play-by-play man, Jimmy Crum, into letting me sit with him and help with the statistics. I watched those friends on the court at every home game on their way to the championship; I watched that magical basketball friendship form and grow and become so strong that their team became the finest in the country. What must it be like to be part of a friendship that is played out so publicly -- part of hardwood recollections woven into the fabric of the lives of strangers who will never meet you? ""It's probably something the rest of us can never fully comprehend,"" said Lee Caryer, a sports historian who wrote the book ""The Golden Age of Ohio State Basketball,"" and who knows every member of that championship team. ""But I can tell you that the bond between them is real, and that they wear it very well. It goes way beyond basketball."" Most of us, if we are lucky enough when we are young to have friends whom we treasure, tend to lose track of some of them over time. Most of us have our own versions of that moment in the photograph: a moment when we suddenly know for sure that, despite our dreams and best intentions, the golden days when we first found each other have drifted off, and that we are on our way to somewhere else, somewhere different. But there always is the chance that we can recapture the memories. Later this month, in Columbus, the living members of that championship team will gather for a series of 50th anniversary celebrations. The three men in the photograph are all expected to be present. They started off as small-town Ohio boys who didn't even know that the others were alive: Jerry Lucas of Middletown, Larry Siegfried of Shelby, John Havlicek of Martins Ferry. They ended up as a part of each other. That's the lesson for all of us, as this new year takes its first faltering steps, and, all across the country, new friendships form and old ones seem to splinter. That's the lesson, full of hope and harmony: . The best friendships never truly die. We may go our separate ways, for a while. But the friendships not only lead the way home. The friendships are home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.",0.6670483,9077
18,"(CNN)  -- Two of the biggest stars in the NBA will be team-mates next season after a blockbuster trade which sees Shaquille O'Neal move from the Phoenix Suns to the Cleveland Cavaliers -- the home of league MVP LeBron James. Shaquille O'Neal is hoping his arrival will put a smile on the faces of Cleveland fans. The 37-year-old O'Neal is one of the all-time greats of basketball, winning four NBA championships, three straight with the Los Angeles Lakers and the other with Miami Heat. James is widely recognized as the sport's current superstar, but the 24-year-old has been left frustrated by Cleveland's failure to win the title. He stormed off the court after  their loss to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference finals, not even shaking hands with 2008 Olympic teammate Dwight Howard. The trade, which sees Phoenix get center Ben Wallace and guard Sasha Pavlovic, has been talked about since February but finalized on Thursday night. ""I was elated about the trade because I get to play with one of the greatest players to ever play the game in LeBron James,"" O'Neal was quoted on the NBA's official Web site www.nba.com. O'Neal averaged 17.8 points and 8.4 rebounds in 75 games for the Suns last season and believes he still has much to offer the NBA. ""My numbers are not good enough to retire. Three more years left,"" O'Neal wrote on his Twitter blog. His career averages are 24.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots, with his peak seasons coming as he led the Lakers to three straight titles from 2000-02. The Lakers traded him to Miami where he spent three seasons, helping them to the NBA Championship three years ago. He has played in Phoenix for the past two years, restricted by injuries in his first season. The Cavs, powered by James, won 66 regular season games and their first eight in the playoffs before coming unstuck against the Magic. They will be hoping that O'Neal will be the final piece in the jigsaw to land the first American sports championship for Cleveland in 45 years.",0.6637742,4924
20,"(CNN)  -- The recession means competition in pro football this year isn't restricted to the gridiron. The National Football League and its 32 teams also are battling for the consumer's discretionary spending dollars. Less-established NFL teams, such as the Jacksonville Jaguars, face special challenges in the recession. And just like on the playing field, some teams are having an easier time scoring an economic touchdown than others. ""Overall ticket sales are very positive but difficult in these challenging times,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement. He did not provide overall ticket sales numbers for the current season. The league is coming off a year that saw overall attendance drop slightly, 0.7 percent, from 2007 amid the start of the economic slowdown. Bill Prescott, a Jacksonville Jaguars vice president and the team's chief financial officer, said the team started to see the impact of the recession last year, when single-game ticket sales and concession revenue dropped as the season progressed. Heading into this season, he said, sales are off even more than the team expected -- new ticket sales are down 75 percent from last year and season ticket renewals are down 10 percent. No Jaguar games are sold out, despite a recent survey by The Media Audit that found 76 percent of adults in Jacksonville, Florida, regularly follow the Jaguars -- the fifth-best percentage of any NFL market. ""The economy is having that impact on us,"" Prescott said. ""As a very small market, I think we're feeling it more than some of the other teams in the league."" The Minnesota Vikings also have yet to sell out any of their games, though the team expects that could change with the recent high-profile signing of quarterback Brett Favre. Within a day of Favre's signing, the Vikings had sold an additional 3,000 season tickets and 10,000 single-game tickets. ""The economy's affecting all professional sports teams,"" said Steve LaCroix, the Vikings' vice president of sales and marketing. ""We're not only competing for people's time and money, but trying to keep the fans in the stadium on game day as opposed to watching on TV."" LaCroix said there weren't a large number of cancellations in season ticket holder accounts. However, some fans did trim down the number of seats in their respective accounts. LaCroix added some are coming back on board as the season approaches. The Cincinnati Bengals are getting nationwide exposure through the HBO reality series ""Hard Knocks,"" which chronicles the team's training camp and preparation for the upcoming season. However, the Bengals' streak of 44 straight sellouts, a franchise record, is at risk, according to spokesman Jim Brennan. The Bengals' September 13 home opener against Denver is not sold out yet. Some teams, however, are more than holding their own as far as ticket sales go despite the nation's fiscal woes. The Denver Broncos are sold out for the 40th straight year -- dating back to the first game of the 1970 season, according to spokesman Jim Saccomano. And Chicago Bears spokesman Scott Hagel says the team is sold out for the 25th straight season. He adds the season ticket renewal rate is well over 90 percent, on par with the prior decade. According to league spokesman McCarthy, 24 of the NFL's 32 teams did not raise ticket prices from last year. One of the teams that did is the Indianapolis Colts, which bumped up the cost of 10 percent of its season ticket holder seats, according to team spokesman Craig Kelley. All games are sold out. Two factors working in the Colts' favor -- they have a new stadium that opened last season and the team has been a perennial contender for the past decade. In order to try and offset the impact the economy has on the game, McCarthy said teams have created more options and flexibility for fans in order to help them afford tickets. Among those options are half-season ticket plans, such as the ones offered by the Jaguars and the New York Jets. ""We knew some season ticket holders because of the economy wouldn't be able to afford to come to all 10 games (including the preseason),"" said the Jaguars' Prescott. The half-season plan has been very popular, he said. ""We wanted to make as many products available to them whether they could come to one game, two games or with the half package we've bundled five games in each package so they can come for half a season."" Prescott said the team is also considering introducing a package where fans can purchase tickets for a few games of their choice. David Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute, thinks the best way for teams to limit the recession's impact on ticket sales is to offer exemplary customer service. ""These fans need to feel as though they're having a great time and they're getting value for their money,"" said Carter. ""If they're able to do that, they will justify continuing to spend on the NFL, because every game matters. They want to be part of the continuity of the NFL season."" Carter believes the league has to fight the recession on two fronts. He says the first is the pricing of seats to everyday fans -- especially those in markets where the demand isn't as keen as the NFL would like. The second challenge is corporate resistance. ""You have those that have traditionally purchased seats or acquired sponsorships taking a long look at whether they want to be involved this year or not, and a lot of corporate budgets are already in bed for the rest of the year,"" explained Carter. Still, Carter believes the NFL may be well-equipped to weather the economic storm, thanks in large part to timing. ""There's a general feel that things are picking up in the economy, and I think that's going to bode well for them over time. They may have survived this downturn a little better than the other leagues."" Matt Gonter has been a Washington Redskins season ticket holder for the past five years. He said he briefly considered whether to cancel his subscription heading into this year but decided against it -- citing the team's long waiting list to get season tickets. ""I swore to myself if I ever got Redskins season tickets, I'd do everything in my power to keep them,"" Gonter said. However, he did turn down an option to upgrade to different seats and a parking pass, saying he would have considered it in years past but not under the current economic climate. He also might sell his tickets for certain games online. ""I'm thinking of going on StubHub and selling a couple of tickets. I eat so much of the cost for the preseason tickets, because you have to pay full price for those,"" Gonter said. One ticket for an NFL game this year on the secondary ticket seller goes for an average of $151, compared with $156 at this time a year ago. Four-year Cleveland Browns season ticket holder Zeke Paster held on to his subscription and plans to make cutbacks instead when it comes to concessions and tailgating costs. However, he may get rid of some of his tickets before the season is over. ""If they're not doing well, I would maybe try to sell the tickets for some of the cold weather games,"" Paster said. Paster and Gonter admit surrendering their season ticket packages for good would be a painful decision. ""The atmosphere is unmatched,"" Paster said. ""There's nothing like being in the stadium or in the parking lot when the Browns are doing well."" Gonter says the camaraderie is worth the cost. ""I just like the experience of sitting in the parking lot under a tent, tailgating, drinking beer and then going to the game and having a good time watching the Redskins.""",0.66177773,7402
21,"LOGANVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- The crowd cheered as Morgan Lawless faced her first pitch of the fall baseball season. Morgan Lawless, who has cerebral palsy, plays baseball at Bay Creek Park near Atlanta, Georgia. The 14-year-old middle-school student clenched her teeth as she swung the bat into a single. Instead of running to first base, Lawless zoomed over in her motorized wheelchair. Lawless has cerebral palsy. She's among nearly 300 children who play in a special-needs baseball league at Bay Creek Park in the Atlanta, Georgia, suburb of Loganville. ""It's actually fun because we get to be kids and we can play like regular people,"" Lawless said. What's different about this ballpark is that the field is made of a rubberized material that allows for easier movement in wheelchairs. ""We started out on a dirt field,"" said league founder Cathy Smith. ""But power wheelchairs and dirt don't mix."" Smith helped raise some of the half-million dollars in private and county funding needed to build the field in 2004. She said she gets goosebumps whenever she watches the young players come across home plate. ""The grin and smile on their faces just says it all."" Coach Tom Estes joined the program eight years ago with his now-15-year-old son, Justin, who has cerebral palsy. Estes noted that some of the players, like his son, use a wheelchair, but others with autism, Down syndrome and multiple sclerosis are ambulatory.  Health Minute: Watch more on special needs baseball » . During a game, the children are paired with young helpers from another local baseball league. No special skills are required to participate, Estes said. ""If we have to help them hit, help them run, help them catch, we are simply here to let them play baseball."" The coaches have taken extra precautions to make sure no one gets hurt. The players wear batting helmets, and a coach feeds large, softball-sized rubber balls into a pitching machine to control the direction. There are no umpires, and no one really keeps score. ""We have a lot of tie ball games,"" Estes chuckled. The games are short, just two innings, but everyone gets to play. ""It's not about competition as much as it is about the ability to just do what other kids do,"" said Mike Lawless, Morgan's father. He said his daughter looks forward to the games all week. So does Estes' son. ""Until you get involved, you don't realize the closed life they live,"" Tom Estes said. Being part of the team gives the players a sense of independence and self control and gets them outside in the fresh air, he said. ""They're out here doing the same thing as the other kids. They really don't do that on a normal basis."" The weekly games also give the kids something to brag about in school on Monday morning, Estes said. ""They hear everyone else talking about it...and my son can say, 'Yeah, I hit a home run yesterday, too. It was great.' "" Justin Estes seemed to take all the attention in stride. And what does he think is the best part about playing baseball? Pointing past his wheelchair to the smooth surface of the field, he said simply, ""No ruts.""",0.6605064,7825
22,"New York (CNN) -- When the New York Jets face the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday for what may be the final football game played at Giants Stadium, fans in attendance won't be able to drown their sorrows or toast a victory. The Jets have banned the sale of alcohol on Sunday at the stadium they've called home for 26 years. ""With the late start of Sunday's game, coupled with this being the final regular season and final game at the stadium, we feel it is prudent not to serve alcohol,"" said Bruce Speight, a spokesman for the team. The Jets approach the decision of whether to serve alcohol on a game-by-game basis, Speight said. Fresh off a victory over the formerly undefeated Indianapolis Colts, the Jets are on the verge of their first play-off berth in three years -- and fans are riled up and ready to go. And Jets fans are known for rowdy behavior -- for example, a half-time ""tradition"" of women baring their breasts for men who loudly urge them to do so. In lieu of alcohol, the Jets said, they'll pass out green and white ""rowdy towels"" to the first 70,000 fans arriving at the stadium. But the ban has raised the ire of a New Jersey vodka distillery. Majorska Vodka, which calls itself ""one of the largest liquor companies in the Garden State,"" is calling for a 24-hour boycott of Johnson & Johnson products because, according to company spokesman Jeff Scott, Jets owner Woody Johnson is the ""heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune."" Scott said Majorska plans to stop paying for three of their executive's seats at the Meadowlands and that the company is set to lose more than $100,000 in revenue from tailgate parties this weekend. The New York Jets officially declined to comment, but team spokesman Speight said that ""negative fan reaction has been minimal at best"" and pointed out that vodka is not sold anywhere in the stadium and the ban does not apply to tailgating. But Martin Silver, Majorska's president and CEO, said fans are shocked and outraged that the Jets are treating their supporters ""like children."" Silver, a life-long Jets backer with a Joe Namath jersey hanging in his office, is directing his frustration at the team's ownership because he feels they are ""controlling the game completely."" He said his company is distributing anti-Johnson & Johnson petitions Friday to 350 sports bars across New Jersey. ""We're taking this on, right to the top, to Johnson,"" said Silver. Woody Johnson is the grandson of Johnson & Johnson founder Robert Wood Johnson, but is not currently connected to the company. William C. Weldon is the company's chairman and CEO. None of the Johnson family serves on the company's management team or board of directors. Johnson & Johnson spokesman Bill Price said that ""officially we have no comment given that the Johnson family has had no managerial role with the company for decades."" Giants Stadium, part of the Meadowlands Sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has been home to both the Jets and the New York Giants, who played their first game there on October 10, 1976. Early on during their tenancy at Giants Stadium, the Jets refered to the 82,000-seat arena simply as ""the Meadowlands"" although in recent years Jets tickets have used the facility's official name. The stadium, which has hosted popes, concerts and major league soccer as well as football, is to be demolished after this season. Both New York teams will move into a new stadium just a short distance away next season. That stadium will get its name from a corporate sponsor, yet to be named.

23,"(CNN)  -- Houston Rockets team physician Tom Clanton has said the foot injury currently sidelining Chinese center Yao Ming could threaten the seven-foot-six-inch player's career. Yao Ming's entire basketball future could be in danger due to his persistent foot injury. ""At this point, the injury has the potential for him missing this next season and could be career-threatening,"" Clanton told the Houston Chronicle regional newspaper. ""One of the things we are trying to get is a consensus opinion on that, to make certain there is no option we are overlooking that would provide an earlier return or would be an option for treatment that he would prefer rather than doing additional surgery,"" he added. Yao fractured his left foot last month during a semifinal match against the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Western Conference semifinals and has been visiting specialists ahead of treatment since then. Clanton continued: ""At this stage, he is having no symptoms or physical signs, he has no tenderness, no swelling, no redness. When he came back in, he was feeling like everything was perfect, and he would start rehabilitation and get ready to play. ""The findings on the CT were shocking for him and for us. You don't treat a CT scan; you treat a patient. We are looking for every reason to treat this on clinical findings but don't want to put him at risk for a greater fracture,"" he added. The diagnosis raises doubt over the playing future of one of the biggest stars in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and one of the most famous celebrities to hail from China. Yao is a national hero in his homeland, and the news has prompted a frenzy of postings on the internet, arguing about the why's and wherefore's of his injury. ""He is really tired,"" says one Netizen posting on Sina.com. ""He needs to rest, we cannot let the giant fall!"" ""I wish everything will work out well for Yao Ming,"" says another teenage basketball fan. ""There is always a way to deal with injuries. We should not give up."" Some Yao supporters think he should take a long break -- even for the whole season -- and make a comeback later. ""I think his injury is very bad,"" opines Ma Jian, a TV commentator who played for the Chinese national team. ""With all the weight training the team have put him through in the past seven years, Yao has gained about 20 kilos in his upper body. But his lower body, especially his feet, did not gain much strength to hold his large frame."" The 28-year-old Yao has been a perennial pick for the NBA All-Star teams since moving from the Shanghai Sharks to the Rockets in 2002. Yao also captained the Chinese team as hosts at the 2008 Beijing Games, as well as taking the role of flag-bearer in the opening ceremony. Yao was awarded the honor of ""model worker"" in 2005 by China's ruling Communist Party. However, despite his popularity, Yao still has his share of detractors. Known as ""Yao hei"" -- they are people who are out to smear the player. ""He is a man made of glass,"" says one posting on Sina.com. ""Should we call him Yao the glass or Yao the porcelain?"" asks one rhetorically. Yao is now a multi-millionaire, earning millions of dollars yearly, not just from his NBA team but from lucrative commercial endorsements. Admirers say Yao has done more for improving China's image overseas than any modern-day politician or diplomat. Next to the giant panda, Yao is perhaps China's best known and much loved, icon, in part because exudes a wholesome, feel-good image. ""He is such an affable, likeable guy,"" recalls Colin Pine, who used to serve as his personal translator during his years as an NBA rookie in Houston. His demeanor on and off the court has endeared him to the media and multitude of basketball fans overseas, who admire his modesty and maturity. His loyal fans hope Yao will get an extension of his already long and successful career.",0.64856684,5439
24,"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chinese investors want to cash in on the country's NBA fever with a bid to buy a 15 percent stake in the Cleveland Cavaliers. Chinese superstar Yao Ming has been linked with a switch to Cleveland if Huang's deal goes through. Chinese-born businessman Kenny Huang is heading the deal, estimated to be worth more than $70 million. Huang has masterminded previous sports deals, including introducing Mandarin advertisements in the Houston Toyota Center, home of Rockets and Chinese basketball star Yao Ming. With his U.S.-based partner Marc Ganis, Huang founded SportsCorp China, a company that facilitates sports and sponsorship contracts between the United States and China. Ganis said that if the deal goes through, it would rank as the largest international sports transaction ever made by Chinese nationals. ""Simply having Chinese ownership will increase significantly the visibility of the team within China,"" Ganis said. ""There will be much more coverage [of the Cavaliers] on the electronic news as well as the printed news. which means the team gets a much broader brand penetration in China for themselves, for their sponsors, and for any other business activities that they may want to engage in."" The news has already sparked excitement among China's massive basketball fan base. ""It makes me proud that the Chinese will be working with my favorite team,"" said a 14-year-old boy at Beijing's Youth Pro Basketball Training Camp. ""It's an honor."" At the training camp, players practice in the shadow of a giant statue of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal, who last month moved to losing Eastern Conference finalist Cleveland from Phoenix Suns. ""They're crazy for basketball,"" said the camp's founder and former Chinese national basketball player Ma Jian. ""Basketball has probably become the number one most popular sport in China."" Ma says China's fascination with shooting hoops stems partially from NBA efforts to promote the league in the world's most populous nation. A minority ownership of an NBA team will take China and the NBA's love-love relationship to the next level. ""It is a natural extension of what the NBA's efforts have been in China,"" Ganis said in an interview, ""for Chinese investors to look not just at sponsoring the NBA, not just getting athletes as endorsers of their products, but also for them to now move into ownership of NBA franchises,"" The move is also expected to bolster the Cavaliers' marketing opportunities in China, where the franchise's merchandise is already a top seller. Some say that deal may even entice LeBron James, who has claimed he wants to be the first billion-dollar athlete, to re-sign with his hometown team next summer. James, or ""Little Emperor"" as the Chinese call him, is hugely popular in China. It seems the feeling's mutual. Playing for a team with links to China, ""should be fun,"" James told Cleveland newspaper, The Plain Dealer. ""It's a big market; they love the game of basketball .I've been over there the last four or five summers, and I know how much they are inspired about the game."" There's also speculation that if the deal is finalized, the Chinese presence at Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena may increase by one. A move by Yao to the Cavaliers has been at the center of discussion in the Chinese bloggosphere. A Chinese forum post reads: ""I think there is around a 60 percent chance that Yao Ming will go to the Cavaliers because now the team is part-owned by Chinese investors and they will want to sign him."" ""This is all an unknown,"" said Yao in the interview with his hometown Shanghai TV station. Although Yao's recent injury may keep him off the court, it won't keep Chinese fans from watching the NBA -- despite speculation that his broken foot could end his career or, at the very least, keep him out of the next season. ""Despite Yao's injury, many people in China will still be interested in basketball,"" says Mang Hongche, the manager of one of Beijing's NBA Stores. ""Yao Ming's our favorite, but besides Yao there are also other players that we like, like Kobe and LeBron."" With Chinese basketball fans in it for the long-run, the future may see more partnerships between the NBA and China. ""In the next three to five years you will see a lot more sponsorships [with the NBA],"" Ma Jian said. ""The Kenny Huang deal and Yao Ming are just a piece driving this market."" Some analysts say there's a possibility the NBA and China may even tie the knot by creating an NBA-CBA (Chinese Basketball Association) partnership. ""At the end of the day, the NBA is still a league, so at some point they'll want to have a league here on the ground,"" says Michael Sun, managing director of sports giant IMG. ""This is something that I'm sure [NBA China CEO] Ted Chan thinks about every day.""",0.6472726,9879
25,"(CNN) -- Archie Manning: Super Bowl XLIV is Sunday in Miami, Florida. The New Orleans Saints will face the Indianapolis Colts, and it's the first time the Saints have been in the Super Bowl in the team's four-decade history. Archie Manning is in an interesting situation. The quarterback was drafted by the Saints in 1971, and was hands-down the most famous and revered Saint, staying with them for ten years. He still has a home in New Orleans, Louisiana. Now his son, Peyton Manning, quarterback of the Colts, will face his father's old team, the team he grew up rooting for. Archie Manning and his wife, Olivia, raised three football-playing sons. Cooper, an all-state high school wide receiver and now a partner in an investment firm; Eli, who led the New York Giants to their Super Bowl win two years ago; and Peyton, who did the same for the Colts the year before that. Eli and Peyton both won MVP awards. A few weeks ago, Mike Chappell in the Indianapolis Star reported that Archie Manning said he plans to root for the Colts. ""I'm going to pull for my son,"" Archie said. ""(Saints coach) Sean Payton knows that. He's a great friend of mine. (Saints quarterback) Drew Brees knows that. That's just the way it is. Anybody who thinks it's different must not have children."" Indy Star: Saints legend Archie Manning pulling for son, Colts . Robert Park: North Korea said Friday it was releasing the Korean-American missionary detained after reportedly illegally entering the country in December, state-run media reported. Tyong Park, Robert Park's father, said in San Diego, California, that he was ""so excited"" by the news but had no other information about his son's release. Robert Park told relatives before Christmas that he was trying to sneak into the isolated communist state to bring a message of ""Christ's love and forgiveness"" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. After an investigation, North Korean authorities ""decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrong doings into consideration,"" the state-run Korea Central News Agency said. During an interview with North Korean authorities, Park reportedly told investigators that ""he was taken in by the false rumor spread by the West and committed a criminal act in the end."" Park said he heard stories of concentration camps and of mass killings, prompting him to go to North Korea to help, the news agency said. A South Korean Web site in December posted a copy of the letter it said Park was trying to deliver to Kim, urging the North Korean leader to free political prisoners and ""open your borders so that we may bring food, provisions, medicine, necessities, and assistance to those who are struggling to survive."" But according to the North Korean news agency, once Park was in North Korea he said he was treated well and allowed to attend church and pray freely. CNN: N. Korea says it is releasing U.S. citizen . Joe Lombardi: He's the grandson of legendary New York Giants and Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi. The Los Angeles Times reports that Joe Lombardi, 38, never met his famous grandfather; he was born a year after his death in 1970. Lombardi, the quarterbacks coach for the New Orleans Saints, told the newspaper that he had seen a quote from his grandfather saying he wished he had never said ""Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,"" and that he feels Vince was misinterpreted. ""I think his point was that certainly your goal is to win, but it's the process that you take in order to get there, the will to win, the will to prepare -- doing everything in your control in order to put yourself in position to win at anything. And I think that's what his point was, more so than win at all costs, even if you've got to cheat or cut corners,"" Joe Lombardi told the Los Angeles Times. L.A. Times: Saints have a Lombardi, and now they want a trophy . Jenny Sanford: ""Staying True"" by Sanford, who in December filed for divorce from South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, will be available in bookstores Friday. Reporters exposed the governor's affair with an Argentine woman after he disappeared for several days last summer. Staffers said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. Sanford later admitted he was actually in Argentina with his mistress. Rather than standing by their men, wives of morally challenged politicians are now publicly opting to let their husbands clean up their own messes. That is one reason why former investment banker Jenny Sanford wrote her book, publisher Ballantine Books says on its Web site. ""She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told,"" says the synopsis of her book on the site.

Powell has won the $100,000 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award for his book ""Chronic."" Powell teaches at the University of San Francisco and lives in the Bay Area of California. According to the Poetry Foundation, Powell was born in 1963 in Albany, Georgia. When he was teaching at Sonoma State, he noticed that many of his students wrote poems that somehow fit the size of the page they were working on, so he began experimenting with his students. What difference would it make if words were written on a candlestick or a roll of toilet paper? When he wrote the first poem for his book, ""Tea,"" he turned his legal pad sideways and began writing longer lines of poetry. Powell receives his prize this April. Here's an excerpt from his poem, ""Chronic:"" I carry the same baffled heart I have always carried / a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy / for I see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere / by the open air, I swore out my list of pleasures: / sprig of lilac, scent of pine / the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch...""

There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.",0.64553744,8878
26,"(CNN) -- It seems no-one in South Africa can fail to be gripped by World Cup football fever. The running, tackling, shooting, offside-appealing proof comes with a clutch of grannies who have been playing in a fiercely competitive league around the Nkowankowa township, 600 kilometers north of Johannesburg. A squad of 35 nans down domestic duties twice a week to take to the field for their team Vakhegula Vakhegula, and compete against seven other teams in the region. Some of them even credit the beautiful game as having turned their lives around. ""I like to play soccer because it helps,"" said Nari Baloyi, who at 47-years-old, clocks in as one of the youngest players. ""We were sick, but now our temperatures, our blood pressures... have gone down ...even our doctors are amazed when we go for a check-up."" One of the more elderly members, Nora Makhubela, is convinced that football has given her a new lease of life following the setback of suffering six strokes. ""My life has really changed...if I were to run with you I would beat you even though I'm much older,"" she said, throwing down the gauntlet to the likes of Ronaldo, Messi et al. ""My life has improved because of the football. I wish God could bless the person who came up with this great idea."" The women contribute around $1 a month each for footballs, kit, and travel to the bi-annual regional tournament. Dozens of noisy fans cheer on the players, with the distinctive sound of the vuvuzelas -- a South African trumpet -- creating an atmosphere that would be welcome at any European Champions League tie. Makhubela is hoping her new-found love of the game extends long enough for her to be able to watch some of the matches when the World Cup begins in June. ""I pray every day to God to keep me alive until 2010. I would really love to watch the games,"" she said. The team was formed three years ago to offer older women a chance to exercise and come together as a group, says community worker Beka Ntsanwisi. ""Some of them couldn't even walk properly and if they did something in their free time they would be knitting or sewing and sitting all the time...here they run, shout, fight with you...it keeps them young,"" she said. David Maake said his job coaching the team is the best he's ever had. ""With young boys you need more money to achieve many things...here, I may come with my stress...but I will laugh so much until I forget everything,"" he said. The team have even suggested they play a curtain raiser for the main event itself, a brainwave the footballing authorities have said they will give serious thought to. If the women do manage to take part as an hors d'oeuvre to the World Cup proper one thing is for sure, what they lack in skill they will make up for in enthusiasm.",0.6451188,7616
27,"HONOLULU, Hawaii (CNN) -- Battered by the current economic recession, Hawaii's economy could get a strong boost from two key sporting events. The Pro Bowl this year was played at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. It will return there in 2011. The National Football League's Pro Bowl Game will return to Honolulu in 2011 -- an event that is expected to bring millions of dollars in revenue. Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann is also hoping to lure the 31st Summer Olympic Games -- but not to his city. He's actively supporting Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Games. ""How does that play out for Hawaii? Well, obviously if we get the Olympics -- that is (the) USA -- we benefit from a Discover America campaign that we'd like to see with visitors coming prior to Chicago to Hawaii or after, and visiting other parts of our country,"" the mayor said. ""What I really want to do is promote Hawaii as a great place for some of these teams to come and do a little R&R (rest and relaxation) or training before they go on to the Olympics in Chicago."" Hannemann will head to Chicago, Illinois, this weekend to court International Olympics Committee members, who are in the Windy City to evaluate its plan to host the Games. On October 2, the IOC will choose among Chicago; Madrid, Spain; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; or Tokyo, Japan, as the 2016 host city. Hannemann co-chairs the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Olympic Task Force, along with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, which he said aims ""to bring the Olympics to America in 2016."" Hawaii's economy is heavily dependent on tourism, and the economic recession means fewer people are visiting the island state. With three-quarters of the state's population living in Honolulu, Hannemann said, workers are especially hit hard in the capital city. ""The slowdown in tourism has resulted in shorter hours, in some cases even a decrease in their wages, and hopefully a last resort is some of them are being laid off as a result of some of these businesses going out of business,"" he said. ""So our job is just to continue to do what we can to work with private industry to shore up the tourism industry. It is our No. 1 industry, nothing comes close."" Tourism accounts for between $10 billion and $12 billion each year compared to Hawaii's second-largest industry, which is military spending, according to Hannemann. That accounts for between $3 billion and $4 billion annually, the mayor said. Last month, the Hawaii Tourism Authority voted to allow the NFL's Pro Bowl game to return to Hawaii in 2011 and 2012. The game has been held the week after the Super Bowl at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu since 1980, and has sold out every time. Next year, it will take place in Miami, Florida, before the Super Bowl -- raising concerns that it will not be as much of a draw because no Super Bowl players will participate in the game. Hawaii authorities agreed to allow the game to return to the state under the condition that the NFL would consider returning the Pro Bowl to the Sunday after the Super Bowl ""depending on the success, or failure, of the 2010 game in Miami,"" according to the NFL. Hannemann said the tens of thousands of people who attend the game annually have then spent ""at least $30 million"" across the state of Hawaii. Losing the game would not only be an economic loss for the state, but a ""major downer"" for residents, he said. ""People (have) said, 'Oh, my goodness, now we lost the Pro Bowl. We've had it here for over 20 years, it's been a sell-out. What's going on here? ... Everything's going to go out of Hawaii,' "" Hannemann said. ""So I got involved, I went and talked to some of the commissioners there, I changed their votes, and we're able to keep the Pro Bowl here."" But hosting the Pro Bowl will come at a cost. Hawaii will have to pay $4 million each year it hosts the game. In a recent commentary in the East Oahu Sun newspaper, writer Joe Edwards questioned whether the cost of hosting the game would come at the expense of projects more vital to residents -- such as a long-awaited rail transit project. ""Don't get me wrong: I like the Pro Bowl. I've been to several. It's a great show. But our own citizens, and our own football team, should come well before the NFL,"" Edwards wrote. Hannemann insists that despite the recession, he will be able to deliver on his campaign promise of a public rail system in Honolulu, which is scheduled to break ground this year. ""Even under the rubric of a stimulus package, we're going to get some monies there to push this out,"" Hannemann said, noting that Hawaii's senior U.S. senator, Daniel Inouye, is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He also said the measure is supported by President Barack Obama, who was born and grew up in Hawaii. ""These are tough times, but if there's a necessary project -- what I call a need-to-have versus a nice-to-have -- I'm going to make all the justification in the world and then we're going to do it,"" he said.",0.643973,2880
28,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In sport, being the best is not just about the having the greatest players. Here are five teams that have gone from zeroes to heroes, and in the process left their mark on sporting history. 1. The European Ryder Cup team . The 1980 U.S. hockey team's 'Miracle on Ice' against the Soviet Union. Europe's Ryder Cup team has become renowned for upsetting the form book, frequently triumphing against higher ranked American opposition. Since European players were first allowed to join the British and Irish team for the famous golf tournament (to improve the level of competition) in 1979, the U.S. has won six times; Europe seven; and the teams have tied once. The slight edge enjoyed by Europe, however, belies the lowly status of their players in world golf. For the last tournament two years ago in Ireland, for example, the Americans boasted 68.4 world-ranking points and the top three players, including world number one, Tiger Woods. Compare this with just 47.8 ranking points for the Europeans. Even so Europe went on to achieve a record third consecutive win. The key to this success has been the camaraderie and teamwork exhibited by the Europeans. Their players have consistently rallied around their position as underdog, managing to achieve a level of togetherness made all the more surprising since the team is made up of a collection of nationalities that are better known for falling out with each other. 2. The 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team . A famous victory against a seemingly invincible Soviet Union side propelled this team of college players and amateurs to the level of national heroes. Although the U.S. team went on to win the gold medal by defeating Finland at the Winter Olympics, it was the earlier match against the Soviets that captured the popular imagination. Classed as amateurs, the Soviet players were essentially professional, and were provided with different job titles by the communist government to allow them to compete. Many of their players were considered legends of world ice hockey at the time. The U.S. team coached by Herb Brooks was, by contrast, genuinely amateur and came into the tournament in Lake Placid, New York, as rank outsiders. Their youthfulness and tenacity combined with patriotic home support saw them upset predictions, defeating the Soviets 4-3 in a match that became known as the ""Miracle on Ice."" The win over their Cold War enemies seized the imagination of the U.S. public -- it inspired two films and was voted the greatest sporting moment of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated. Dave Ogrean, former executive director of USA Hockey, called the victory ""the most transcending moment in the history of our sport in this country."" 3. The 'Crazy Gang' defeat Liverpool in the FA Cup . Nobody expected lowly Wimbledon Football Club to do anything other than turn up when they played Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Dubbed the 'Crazy Gang' by British media because of the eccentric antics of their players and staff, who included future film actor Vinnie Jones, the team was outclassed on every front. At the time Liverpool were the dominant force in English football, having won the league title that year for the seventh time in a decade. Managed by former player Kenny Dalglish and boasting a host of stars, the team was expected to cruise past Wimbledon, who had little resources and were considered something of a joke. Under the chairmanship of Lebanese businessman Samir ""Sam"" Hammam, Wimbledon earned a reputation for bizarre behaviour, with players setting fire to new signings football kits, and Hammam once offering to buy a camel for the team's striker if he scored 20 goals in a season. The practical jokes helped to foster an extraordinarily strong team spirit, however, which saw them topple Liverpool 1-0, with Wimbledon captain Dave Beasant the hero of the hour after he saved a penalty. 4. Joe's Jets win the Superbowl . When the New York Jets took on the Baltimore Colts in the 1969 Superbowl, it was the team from Baltimore that was strong favorites. The Colts had stormed the National Football League (NFL) championship, considered at the time a much stronger competition than the American Football League (AFL), headed that year by the Jets. This news, however, seemed to have escaped Joe Namath, the Jets' charismatic quarterback, who gave a ""guarantee"" a few days earlier at a news conference in Miami -- where the Superbowl was being staged -- that his team would win. True to his predictions, the Jets came out on top with Namath taking all the plaudits (Sports Illustrated described him as a ""folk hero of the new generation"") after a blistering performance that saw his team triumph 16-7. 5. The Magical Magyars . The legendary Hungarian national football team of the 1950s is still considered one of the greatest teams in the history of sport. Although many of its players -- most notably striker Ferenc Puskas, who eventually moved to Real Madrid -- went on to play in the West, during its heyday the majority of the team was drawn from the Honved club in Budapest. The Magyars remained unbeaten for an unprecedented 33 consecutive matches (a record that still stands today) finally losing out in the 1954 World Cup Final to Germany. This golden age of Hungarian football was brought to an abrupt end in 1956 by the events of the Hungarian Revolution. Puskas and some of his team mates opted to defect to Western Europe, and never played for their country again.",0.63941944,4592
29,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- College football's perennial armchair-quarterback argument over the need for a clear-cut national champion came to Capitol Hill Friday. College football teams play in the BCS for the national championship trophy. The House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection held a hearing to dissect the Bowl Championship Series, asking whether the model needs to be tweaked, overhauled or done away with altogether. Four witnesses testified at the morning hearing, including championship series coordinator John Swofford and Alamo Bowl President Derrick Fox; both of whom defended the current system, though Fox conceded that ""no system is perfect and the Bowl Championship Series is not perfect."" Mountain West Conference Commissioner Craig Thompson and Boise State Athletic Director Gene Bleymaier testified that they would like to see the system revamped. Many critics say they want college football to have a playoff system to ensure that a champion is clearly defined. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, called the Bowl Championship Series format unfair and perhaps took it one step further. ""You should either change your name to BES for Bowl Exhibition System or just drop the C and call it the BS system, because it is not about determining the championship on the field."" Both sides were cordial but opinionated. Fox said he would prefer Washington not get involved. ""Those who don't like the current system will say that's the way of the world, but we don't believe that government should have any role in promoting a demise of the bowl games."" Currently, 11 college conferences and three independents compete in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision -- formerly Division I-A. Six of those 11 conferences are guaranteed spots in the four Bowl Championship Series games. Schools from conferences that critics say are unfairly deemed as low profile are then left to fight their way into those prestige games. They share in significantly less of the series money and have less of an opportunity to challenge for the national title. President Obama is one of the proponents of a college football playoff. In an interview with ESPN in November, Obama said he's had just about enough of the Bowl Championship Series. ""I'm fed up with these computer rankings and this, that and the other. Get eight teams -- the top eight teams right at the end. You got a playoff. Decide on a national champion,"" Obama said. Before heading out early to catch a flight, Barton made it clear that he expects to see college football change its ways or risk having lawmakers introduce legislation to impose change for them. ""I think there is better than a 50 percent chance that if we don't see some action in the next two months on a voluntary switch to a playoff system that you will see this bill move,"" he said.",0.63836735,3525
30,"(CNN) -- The games begin Thursday, and March Madness buzz will soon take over the lunchroom. Everywhere you turn, co-workers will chat about their favorite teams, the upsets, the injuries. Maybe you will watch the games. Maybe you won't. But maybe, irrespective of whether you plan to follow the tournament, you've ponied up to be part of the office pool. And you don't have to worry about explaining how you made your picks while filling out out your bracket. Everyone is hoping to choose that one team that comes from behind to win. So what if you always pick Gonzaga just because you like saying the name? Should it matter if you take Louisville out of the running just because that jerk who once strung you along came from there? You are in the running like everyone else, and, heck, you might surprise yourself and actually win. In these coming weeks, though, you don't want to sound like an idiot. It would be nice, you think to yourself, if you actually appeared to know what you were talking about. CNN reached out to Stewart Mandel, a senior writer at SI.com who covers basketball, as well as sports fans in the CNN.com newsroom to get some tips for how you can bluff your way through the tournament. With their sage advice, we offer this wisdom: . • Be careful not to talk about a ""buzzer beater"" unless it's actually happened. When they do happen, when a player scores at the buzzer (in the last second) to change the game's outcome, throw the term around wildly. It'll be what everyone is reliving, and if you feel especially bold, you can try to give someone a high-five while saying, ""How about that buzzer beater?"" • Discussing injuries in vague terms is always safe, since most every team has suffered some. Ideas: ""They really can't afford any more injuries this season."" Or, ""Didn't they have a big injury this year?"" You don't have to know the answer, but it's an easy way to engage with a sports nut who will gladly tell you more about some stranger's ankle than you ever wanted to know. • Tell people around the water cooler that you really admire a team's ""tenacity."" Mandel says that's ""a good fastball no one can argue with,"" because by virtue of making it to the tournament, a team's got to have some serious tenacity. Other terms you can throw around to describe a team: ""smart,"" ""experienced"" and ""well-coached."" • Something called ""guard play"" is apparently very big this time of year. You might shake your head and mutter, ""I don't know if their guard play is good enough."" Or, conversely, you can say, ""Oh, yeah, I think they have a good chance because they've got good guard play."" • There are some things you might say that could be risky, as they may prompt others to ask you a question in return. For example, if you were to say, ""Gosh, that was a big shot,"" someone might ask, ""Which one?"" This would be a good time to spill your coffee, diverting attention. • In basketball, the word ""press"" (short for pressure) is used when discussing defense. So you might want to express your heartfelt concern about a team ""having trouble with the press."" • There are different conferences that make up the NCAA. The Big East dominated this year. You can talk about how the ""Big East ruled,"" but make sure you don't misspeak and talk about the Big North, because no such thing exists. There is a Big 10, but it's made up of 11 teams. • ""Ball movement"" refers to how a team passes a ball. Any team that's made it to the ""tourney,"" as some insiders like to say, must be strong in this realm. So you can assume you're covered if you say something like, ""Wow, they have great ball movement."" • A strong three-point game can make the difference for an underdog team. So if some folks are saying how a team doesn't have a chance, you could nonchalantly stroll by and say in passing, ""They could pull an upset if they get hot shooting threes."" Another fun phrase to toss out: ""They live or die by the three."" • Casting blame on referees for making ""questionable calls"" is highly popular. ""Man, there were some questionable calls"" is a good gripe to share, but only if the game was close. If it was a ""blowout,"" a win by a large margin, your saying this would make you look foolish. It might be better to say, if people are chatting about an upcoming game, ""Man, I hope the refs just let them play."" • Word is that everyone loves a ""Cinderella,"" the team that comes out of nowhere to make a good run in the tournament. If you want to sound especially savvy, use it in conjunction with the world ""dance,"" another fun slang term for March Madness, as in, ""It's always nice to see Cinderella go deep in the dance."" • If you feel compelled to throw out a player's name, one you're pretending to be excited to watch, the one to know -- and one that's easy to remember -- is John Wall. Rhymes with ball, if that helps. He's a freshman guard at Kentucky and will likely go pro soon, so using his name next year during March Madness would blow your cover. Keep that in mind. • Last, and this is very important, do not -- repeat -- do not walk into work on April 1 and talk about how crestfallen you are that March Madness is over. The tournament goes by this name, but the actual championship is played in April. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Steve Almasy, Todd Leopold and Manav Tanneeru contributed their wisdom to this very important report.",0.6372794,8991
31,"(CNN) -- It's Sunday night during TNT's coverage of the NBA playoffs, and announcer Kenny Smith, aka ""The Jet,"" is doing push-ups. TNT's Kenny Smith tries to connect personally with NBA fans through his Twitter feed. Not on camera, but on Twitter. ""Hawks look hot! CWebb, my boy Fabian and I doing 30- pushups P90X style every commercial.. getting summeer [sic] ready,"" writes Smith to his followers on Twitter, the microblogging site where you can ""tweet"" brief messages of up to 140 characters. Five hours later, Smith (@TheJetOnTNT) tweets a follow-up: ""Man, i think im gonna be sore."" By Monday morning, though, he seems raring to go again: ""Im not sore today! the workout didnt kill me... Im back!!"" Welcome to today's intersection of sports and social networking, where college athletes, professional players and even broadcasters use tools like Facebook and Twitter to share their thoughts and experiences with fans. ""Sports personalities are tweeting now. They are giving fans a reason to tune in to see their comments,"" says Adam Ostrow, managing editor of Mashable, a blog devoted to online social media. Ostrow believes social networking sites like Twitter allow athletes to connect directly with fans without the filter of the traditional media. And while many athletes and teams have blogs and Facebook profiles, Twitter allows for a more personal connection between fan and sports, he says. NBA All-Star Shaquille O'Neal (@THE_REAL_SHAQ) is both a prolific scorer and a prolific twitterer. His more than 700,000 followers get his tweets about everything from his diet to his recent trip to Graceland. Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong (@lancearmstrong) has more than 650,000 Twitter followers for such updates as ""Eating pizza at home w/ the family. Good test today, kids go home tomorrow (sad), and a hellacious week of training coming up."" Hockey players also are getting into the act. Washington Capitals ace Alex Ovechkin (@ovi8) was on Twitter during the NHL All-Star game in January, tweeting about the festivities and responding to fan questions and comments. One athlete, Milwaukee Bucks forward Charlie Villanueva (@CV31), even got into hot water after tweeting during halftime of a game last month. Villanueva's entry read: ""In da locker room, snuck to post my twitt. We're playing the Celtics, tie ball game at da half. Coach wants more toughness. I gotta step up."" He did. Villanueva finished with a team-high 19 points, and the Bucks won. Now sports announcers are using Twitter to talk to fans about everything from game action to what they do when the cameras are off. Fox Sports (@MLBonFox) baseball commentators and reporters are using Twitter to share tidbits from players and behind-the-scenes moments that the normal fan may not even think about. Fox play-by-play announcer Joe Buck, one of the network's wittier twitterers, shared this recent tender moment from the broadcast booth: ""Joe Buck: Cold in the booth in STL. Tim [McCarver] and I are bundled up. And snuggling. Hard to type. I think hypothermia is starting to set in!"" TNT is using the same approach to connect with basketball fans during the current NBA playoffs. Eleven members of the network's broadcast team have joined Twitter to provide insight into games, offer nuggets from players and solicit fan opinions. ""TNT is an interesting experiment if they add analysis they don't give on TV,"" said Ostrow of Mashable. ""More interesting if they give more non-basketball info."" And they are. When Kenny Smith started on Twitter, he wasn't really sure what it was or how it would work. So he just answered the default question on his page: What are you doing? ""I want to have some fun with it,"" Smith told CNN. ""I love scavenger hunts. I might leave tickets to the conference finals somewhere and leave clues on my Twitter."" Twitter gives announcers another way to connect with sports fans, Smith said. ""You can give an attitude [on Twitter],"" he said. ""They can hear you on the air, but [on Twitter, they] get to hear your voice."" Smith hopes to continue revealing ""behind-the-scenes"" details in his tweets, because he wants his more than 1,000 followers to feel like they are there. And he plans to continue twittering beyond the NBA playoffs. Increasingly, sports fans use social networking to talk back. For the Stanley Cup playoffs, the NHL recently organized ""tweetups"" where Twitter users met face-to-face to talk about whatever brought them together. Events were organized in 21 cities in the United States and Canada. Laura Astorian, a self-described hockey blogger who follows the St. Louis Blues and Atlanta Thrashers, helped organize an NHL tweetup in Atlanta, Georgia. She said even though the city's hockey-fan base is relatively small, the fans rely on each other and use social networking sites like Twitter to communicate. ""The people who did come enjoyed the chance to sit down and talk hockey with like-minded people,"" Astorian said. ""We did have fun, and there was mention of using the tweetup strategy for our draft party in July.""",0.63678634,3047
32,"(CNN) -- Henry Olszewski was stoked in 2008 when he, along with millions of Americans, drafted New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to his fantasy football team. Tom Brady's season-ending knee injury last year sparked an idea at Intermarket Insurance. About eight minutes into the season, a 220-pound safety was blocked into Brady's knee, tearing two of the quarterback's ligaments. Brady's season ended, as did Olszewski's. ""That Monday, [Olszewski] came in the office, and he was bummed out,"" said Anthony Giaccone, president of Intermarket Insurance. ""He asked, 'Why can't we buy insurance for fantasy team players?' "" Thus spawned the brainchild for Fantasy Sports Insurance, which guarantees that NFL players won't miss a certain number of games. FSI will reimburse a fantasy player's entry fee if they do. It's one of a blitz of bizarre businesses cropping up in the $800 million industry of turning quarterback stats to greenbacks, said Paul Charchian, president of the Fantasy Sports Trade Association.  See fantasy football's top 10 prospects » . Charchian is familiar with the wellspring of offbeat companies fueled by the fantasy football craze; he owns LeagueSafe, which stores league entry fees in a bank until it issues a payout to the winner at season's end. Other specialty businesses, he said, range from the obvious, such as trophy companies, to the esoteric, such as fantasy dispute resolution. You read the last one correctly. Web sites like fantasydispute.com and sportsjudge.com offer to mitigate fretful fantasy feuds. Think there was collusion in a trade or your league commissioner is playing favorites? Write up your dispute and send it to one of the sites. For $15, a lawyer will settle your quibble. For the uninitiated: Fantasy football players generally ""draft"" NFL quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends and team defenses and use their statistics each week to score points in head-to-head matchups. Countless variations have proliferated, as have magazines and Web sites beholden only to fantasy players. Sort the top picks by position at SI.com . The NFL has introduced the RedZone Channel, which flips between games where a team is on the verge of scoring, CBSsports.com has launched a live Web show called ""Fantasy Football Today,"" and cable's FX is scheduled to air a sitcom based on a fantasy football league this year. The stakes have skyrocketed as well. The World Championship of Football offers a $300,000 top prize. The Fantasy Football Open Championship's is $1 million. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that a group of well-heeled financiers has a 10-team league with a $100,000 entry fee. A June study by the research company Ipsos says three in 20 American men (and one in 20 women) play some fantasy sport. ""It takes the fans of one sports team and makes them interested in every game that's happening,"" said Jason Kint, senior vice president and general manager for CBSsports.com. ""It's a welcome escape, as much of sports is right now."" Not all fans are enamored, however. ESPN's Colin Cowherd explained his aversion on his radio show last month, saying fantasy football was too time-consuming and, in his experience, for ""total nerds and geeks."" ""I'm a gambler, lived in Vegas. My friends are gamblers. We don't play fantasy football,"" he said. ""We're busy. We have jobs. We have careers. We have lives. We don't have time for three-hour draft parties and an hour or two on the computer every week to update our fullback situation."" But more than 22 million Americans and Canadians do, Charchian said, and the economic downturn doesn't seem to be sacking the industry. ""It's hard to get out. It's enmeshed in your social circle,"" he explained. Also, with most leagues costing less than $10 a week and with the average player spending nine hours weekly researching and tweaking his or her roster, ""the dollar-per-entertainment value is really advantageous,"" Charchian said. Fantasy players at CBSsports.com spent an average of 102 minutes per visit on the site, according to Nielsen data from last year. The site has more users willing to pay to play, whereas competitors like NFL.com and Yahoo! host predominantly free games, ""so it's more meaningful to them,"" Kint said. Kint could not divulge specific figures but said ""millions"" play CBSsports.com's free and pay games. Entry fees and related fantasy products make up about 30 percent of the site's non-advertising revenue, he said. Advertisers are getting wise to the ""coveted market,"" comprised largely of young, educated males, Kint said, as evidenced by the site's partnerships with Ford, Snickers, Buffalo Wild Wings and Dave & Buster's. ""When people are down and depressed, they look for escapes. Fantasy football fills that void like booze and anything else that kind of distracts you,"" said Ed Reichow, owner of Titlecraft, which builds custom trophies only for fantasy footballers. Reichow had the idea after a decade of making trophies for his personal fantasy league. He sold 70 trophies in his first year and is on track to sell more than 100 this year. They are handcrafted from materials such as cherry, Carpathian elm and Swarovski crystal and range in price from $129 to $799, he said. ""It's something you can really pass down if you want to,"" he said. ""And the wife isn't going to get upset if you put it on the mantle, because it's nicer than some of the furniture in the room."" But what would the wife think about buying insurance policies on your fantasy football players? Some spouses must be OK with it because, FSI's Giaccone reported, business has been threefold what he expected -- this, despite that it costs considerably more, percentagewise, to insure a fantasy quarterback than it does a real quarterback. Chris Nash, an underwriter with Australia-based Sportscover, which insures athletes, said the average U.S. football player pays up to 4 percent of the sum insured. FSI's products range between 10 percent and 15 percent of the league entry fee. Despite the contrast, Giaccone described fantasy insurance as a must-have for fantasy die-hards. He went so far as to question the sanity of some fantasy players who might ignore his product. ""If you are playing fantasy sports and you have Tom Brady on your team, you'd be crazy not to insure him,"" he said.",0.63619846,7234
33,"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- When baseball slugger Mark McGwire admitted he had used steroids in his record-breaking 1998 season, he recalled refusing to talk about the subject in his 2005 testimony to Congress. ""After all this time, I want to come clean,"" McGwire announced. ""I was not in a position to do that five years ago in my congressional testimony, but now I feel an obligation to discuss this and to answer questions about it. I'll do that, and then I just want to help my team."" McGwire's admission come as the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating the problem of brain injuries to football players, following heated discussions October 28, when the committee aggressively questioned NFL officials to figure out why the league had done so little to curb this well-known problem. Any government inquiry of this kind draws the familiar charge that politicians should stay out of the business of sports -- even though the NFL and NCAA have in fact responded to congressional pressure by instituting rules to protect players from brain damage. Still, Texas Rep. Lamar Smith said, we ""should also avoid the temptation to legislate in this area. Football -- like soccer, rugby and even basketball and baseball -- involves contact that can produce injuries. We cannot legislate the elimination of injuries from the games without eliminating the games themselves."" This is a familiar refrain. Back in 2005, when several committees investigated the use of steroids in baseball, numerous sports officials warned this was not an issue with which Congress should concern itself. Yet insisting on a firewall between sports and politics ignores the long-standing relationship between these two parts of American society. At the state and local level, sports teams depend on government assistance. There have been a large number of public subsidies, ranging from appropriations for stadium construction to the placement of public transportation near stadiums to tax breaks which the sports industry has depended on for growth. At the federal level, sports owners have also benefited from government. In 1922, the Supreme Court exempted baseball from the antitrust laws. As a result of this, baseball owners were allowed to maintain their monopoly, stifling efforts to launch other leagues and using the exemption to collude on limiting the salaries of players. Some legislators introduced bills trying to overturn the decision, but Congress never passed them. When the Senate held hearings about the exemption in 1958, a number of famous players, including Mickey Mantle and Jackie Robinson, showed up to speak about how the ""reserve clause"" undermined the rights of players. Congress refused to take any action. Free agency did not start until the 1980s. It was only in 1998 that Congress finally passed legislation declaring that some rules, such as restrictions on the movement of players from one team to another, were subject to antitrust laws. Football has a political history of its own. According to the sports historian Richard Davies, the National Football League started a team in New Orleans in 1966, right after Rep. Hale Boggs and Sen. Russell Long of Louisiana helped push through legislation that exempted the NFL from antitrust laws so that there could be a merger with the successful American Football League. When New York Rep. Emanuel Celler insisted on long hearings to decide whether this was permissible, Sen. Long, desperate for a team, short-circuited the legislative process by having the Senate pass a bill by acclamation and attaching it to important anti-inflation tax legislation. The House, under pressure, agreed to the bill at the last minute. ""We couldn't have merged if Congress hadn't passed the law,"" said NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. ""And without a merger, we couldn't have had a Super Bowl. If we'd tried to do it on our own, the antitrust people would have challenged us sooner than later."" There is also a long history of congressional investigations into sports. In 1960, the Senate conducted hearings about the influence of organized crime in professional boxing. Americans were shocked when former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta admitted that he had thrown a fight against Billy Fox in November 1947. Members of the mafia threatened to kill LaMotta, but he testified anyway. During similar hearings in 1961, the boxer Rocky Marciano told legislators that ""it seems absolutely essential that a federal czar be named to head the professional sport of boxing."" Many years later, in 2007, Congress looked into the pension and disability plans of the NFL after complaints by injured players that they were being denied coverage. Congress has been willing to legislate. On October 9, 1996, President Clinton signed the Professional Boxing Safety Act into law, which defined minimum health and safety standards for the sport. The legislation aimed to strengthen the patchwork regulations used by states to monitor the sport. But investigations usually don't produce legislation. In 2005, Congress failed to pass the Clean Sports Act or the Drug Free Sports Act in response to revelations of drug use. Even so, investigations do help raise public awareness about problems and create public pressure on the industry to reform. ""When there is not any regulation,"" said former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, ""it can cause someone to lose their dream, their hopes...."" While some issues, such as the recent investigation into the college bowl system, are easy fodder for ridicule, others, such as brain damage to NFL players, show where the government has a legitimate role. After all, sports is big business, and the playing field is a workplace where regulations are needed. Unfortunately, the sports leagues themselves have not taken an aggressive approach to dealing with this problem. In the same way that baseball owners understood that steroids produced more crowd-pleasing home runs, football owners know that the kind of hard-hitting football that creates injuries often brings crowds to their feet. The government must help guide the industry toward better practices. There is a precedent for investigation. And sports has depended too much on government to now claim to be a free agent.

34,"Editor's note: CNN contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says discussion of ballplayer Ted Williams' corpse is a shameful way to remember the superstar. (CNN) -- ""I was scared,"" Ted Williams said. He was talking about his lifelong fear of not being good enough -- of coming up short. ""I was always afraid I might fail,"" he said. ""I was pictured as being so cocky -- I might have been cocky to some people, but not in my heart. All the time, I was just hoping to make whatever league I was in."" I am thinking about a long conversation I had with Williams toward the end of his life. I'm thinking about it because of the unconscionable thing that is being done to him now that he is gone, now that he is without any defenses. You may have heard about a new book that makes some cruel and repugnant allegations about the mistreatment of his remains. What has been done to Williams' good name since his death at age 83 in 2002 is heartbreaking. First there was the very public battle within his family about what to do with his body; when it was entrusted to a facility that specializes in cryonics -- freezing -- there were tasteless gags all over television. Now there is the nauseating voyeurism surrounding these new allegations. They are unspeakable, and I will not repeat them here. He has been made a joke. It is as if there has been a conscious effort to rob him of his humanity. As if he is a punch line, as if he was never a person with thoughts and feelings. No one deserves this, and certainly not Ted Williams. A magnificent 19-year career with the Boston Red Sox; twice the winner of baseball's triple crown; the last ballplayer to hit .400 in a season; two tours of duty in the military in World War II and the Korean War ... This is the man whose right to rest in respectful peace is being stripped from him. It is a crime. And because he can no longer speak for himself, I will share with you his voice from a time when he could. ""I can't believe how well people have treated me, how nicely,"" he told me. He had suffered a series of strokes; he knew there wasn't much time left. I was writing a monthly column for Life magazine, and he had agreed to talk with me. I told him that there was something striking about his voice: He sounded just like John Wayne. ""John Wayne sounded like me,"" he said, not kidding. When he told me about his fear of failure, it was in the context of always being fixated on his own shortcomings. ""The only time I could savor an evening is if I had done something well,"" he said. ""My most disappointing things all my life were always related to baseball. I didn't feel good because I did something successfully; I felt bad if I failed to do something that I was expected to do."" As a young ballplayer, he supposedly said, ""All I want out of life is that when I walk down the street, people will say, 'There goes the greatest hitter who ever lived.' "" It happened. That was what people said about him. Did it satisfy him? ""I would slide down in my seat a little bit when I heard someone say that,"" he told me. ""Because I wanted people to believe it, but I didn't believe it myself. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now. Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron -- they were so good. When I would be at a dinner and someone would say I was the best, I would want to hide out of sight and sink into the floor."" At the height of his talent, he stepped away from baseball to fly Panther fighter jets in Korea. He was a United States Marine pilot; often he would go out on two-plane missions flying side-by-side with a young Marine hotshot by the name of John Glenn. Talk about two Americans you can count on in a pinch.... I asked Glenn about Williams once. ""He was just great,"" Glenn said. ""The same skills that made him the best baseball hitter ever -- the eye, the coordination, the discipline -- are what he used to make himself an excellent combat pilot."" This is the man who is being degraded today. This is the man who is being treated, in death, as if he is in a carnival sideshow. As I spoke with Williams, with his eyesight failing and his body inexorably shutting down, I asked him: If he could change one thing in his life, what would it be? He said that this, more than anything else, is what he wished for: the ability to ""run like a deer."" I thought he was talking about wishing he could have his youth back -- wishing, in his old age, that he could stand up and run again. But that wasn't it. He said he wished that, back when he was a player, he was just a little faster. ""I would run to first,"" he recalled of his years with the Red Sox, ""and there would be that boom-boom."" The sound of being called out at first base, the ball hitting the fielder's glove just before Williams's foot hit the bag. ""If I could have run a little faster ... how many at-bats did I have?"" he asked me. ""Seven thousand?"" I told him it was 7,706. With 2,654 hits. ""If I could have run just a little faster, I bet you I could have had 50 more hits,"" he said. He paused. There was wistfulness in his voice. ""Maybe a hundred,"" he said. A man seeing death just up the road, still dreaming of excellence. That is the man whose dignity we have treated with such awful indifference. Shame on us.

35,"(CNN) -- As the NCAA basketball tournament kicks into gear this week, March Madness once again spreads out of arenas and into the workplace. Diehard and fair-weather fans alike will take part in office pools, games will be streamed online, and smack will be talked around water coolers.

Read Mandel's analysis of the brackets . And, amid all this game monitoring and chatter, some say productivity and earnings may take a hit, but others say the shared experience bolsters business. The first week of the tournament -- when the most games are played during daytime hours -- could cost U.S. employers as much as $1.8 billion, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a global outplacement company in Chicago, Illiniois, that annually predicts the tournament's impact. This blow to employers is based on surveys showing that 45 percent of Americans enter office pools and waste on average about 20 minutes a day focusing on basketball instead of work. Challenger, Gray & Christmas says that translates to more than 58 million employees. Print your bracket (PDF) ""Employers can no longer claim to be caught off guard by the annual event,"" firm CEO John Challenger said in a written statement. ""Some have tried to squash these pools, most simply ignore them and others have found ways to embrace the tournament as a team-building and morale-boosting opportunity."" But this figure on time and money lost seems ""plucked out of thin air,"" said Don Forsyth, a psychologist who studies group dynamics in the workplace in the Jepson School of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond in Virginia. Who is to say how much time and money people waste each day on personal distractions, he asked. And maybe, he added, the employee who generally dreads going to work comes in energized because of the games. Forsyth, who's been studying work dynamics for 30 years, said the shared experience of feeling the madness probably does the workplace good and leads to gains instead of losses. ""It's a powerful social process,"" he said. ""It builds relationships and rituals within the group. Everyone is included,"" from the corner offices to the mailroom.

36,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The only checks Chris Chelios should be concerned about are the ones he's writing for his children's college tuition, but instead he still has the next body check into the hockey boards on his mind. At 48 years old, Chelios is the oldest American and second oldest player ever to play professional hockey. The veteran of 26 seasons in the National Hockey League has won the Stanley Cup three times, once in Montreal, Quebec, and twice in Detroit, Michigan. Now, the Chicago, Illinois, native has been called up from the American Hockey League's Chicago Wolves to the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers.

Teammate Ron Hainsey said the jokes are minimal. ""You probably won't hear too many from these guys because he might start skating circles around guys here."" Hainsey, like most of the Atlanta Thrashers, grew up watching Chelios play. ""He's in as good of shape as anybody here,"" Hainsey said. ""It's just simply incredible for his age."" In his 9th NHL season, Hainsey has played in about 600 professional hockey games compared to Chelios' 1,600 professional games. ""If there's anybody who's seen just about everything, he's got to be the guy who's it,"" Hainsey said. ""We're going to soak up everything we can from him while he's here."" Chelios still plays hard, but he doesn't play as many minutes as he did in his 20s. When he is on the ice, Hainsey said, Chelios seems to always be in the right place at the right time. ""I think I'm a little smarter than the young guys, but they got their speed that makes up for the lack of smarts,"" Chelios said. Thrashers Head Coach John Anderson is just five years older than Chelios. ""He loves the game. He loves to play and it's not about the money anymore. It's about wanting to win and wanting to play,"" Anderson said. ""I was kidding our defense coach [Todd] Nelson,"" Anderson said. ""I said this is probably the last time in your whole career you're going to get to coach somebody older than you."" Chelios is married with four kids who live in the Detroit area. He has two daughters in high school, one son in college and another son heading to college soon. ""It's been a pretty tough adjustment for me not being with them,"" Chelios said. Both of his sons play hockey. ""You know at some point I got to start watching them,"" he said. ""They're sick of watching me."" Chelios is four years away from reaching Gordie Howe's record of playing in the NHL at age 52, but says he won't break that record. ""He can have the record. He's the greatest ever,"" Chelios said. ""The fact that I've made it this far as an American, that says enough and I feel pretty good about that."" While he looks at his time with the Thrashers as being his last shot at the NHL, he won't close the door on the possibility of another season. ""I think depending on what happens now, realistically, this could be it,"" he said. ""Who knows what could happen? We get on a roll, things start going good, maybe I'll get that urge to come back again.""",0.61868095,9408
37,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A Senate subcommittee Tuesday tackled one of the most contentious issues in U.S. sports: the fairness of the Bowl Championship Series that decides the top college football team each season. Tim Tebow, right, of the Florida Gators talks to coaches at the 2009 BCS national championship game January 8. Convened by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the hearing by the Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights subcommittee provided a sounding board for his state's disappointment over the inability of the undefeated University of Utah to qualify for the BCS national championship game last January. The BCS operates under an agreement among the major college football conferences that decides which teams qualify for the biggest bowl games each season, including the national championship game. It also distributes the revenue generated by the bowl games, with the participating members taking part in more of the post-season matches and taking home more money. Every season brings heated debate over the bowl lineup and calls for a playoff system similar to the ones used for every other National Collegiate Athletic Association sport, including small-college football. President Obama has joined many Americans in expressing his preference for a playoff system to decide the nation's top college football team. Hatch complained that the BCS system denies outsiders -- such as Utah of the Mountain West Conference -- a fair chance to compete with major conferences such as the Big 12, Big 10, Pacific 10 and Southeast Conference for a spot in the lucrative bowl games. Last season, he said, Utah went undefeated and gained a BCS berth in the Sugar Bowl against perennial power Alabama, which it defeated 31-17. However, the BCS ranking system prevented Utah from any realistic chance of selection for the national championship game, which pitted two teams that each had one loss on their records, Hatch said. For schools outside what he called the ""privileged conferences,"" the BCS system has ""significant and largely insurmountable obstacles to playing for a national championship,"" Hatch said. University of Utah President Michael Young complained that the BCS system both stifles competition and guarantees the majority of revenue from bowl games to the traditional powers. ""If you can't beat them, eliminate them,"" he said of BCS policy. In response, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Harvey Perlman said the BCS system -- while imperfect -- is the only workable formula that ensures participation by major football powers such as his institution. The BCS recognizes the strength and depth of traditional programs, Perlman said, rejecting Young's argument that Utah has no chance to improve its status. ""There realistically is something Utah could do,"" Perlman said. ""They could play the schedule Nebraska played."" At the same time, Perlman said that uneven odds are part of every university's experience at one time or another. ""It's the same as when Nebraska walks into the NIH [National Institutes of Health] and seeks a federal grant and competes with Harvard,"" he said. ""Theoretically we have the same the chance, but do we really?"" Two anti-trust experts provided conflicting testimony on whether the BCS system violates the Sherman Antitrust Act. Barry Brett of the law firm Troutman Sanders insisted the BCS holds what amounts to an illegal monopoly and ""uses this control to exclude all but its founding members [from] fair access to the competition and control of hundreds of millions of dollars."" In response, William Monts III of Hogan and Hartson noted the BCS members created the national championship game and therefore have the right to determine who participates. He also warned against seeking anti-trust relief in court, saying a ruling against the BCS would end its existence without creating an alternative. ""The peculiar irony of an anti-trust claim is that it is likely to sound the death knell for the playoff system proponents want,"" Monts said.",0.6147995,5036
38,"(CNN) -- Online and on the air, talking about sports has almost always been a guy thing. Former athletes and coaches banter on a more-or-less equal footing with other guys who've never played a down or never hiked a ball but have a head full of stats and an encyclopedic knowledge of the manly arts. Meshall Shuman zooms in on Hattie Lemon at a recent taping of ""Ladies in the Locker Room"" It's almost insulting to say the obvious, but there are plenty of women who know their sports, too. And they have their own sports show, one that offers an alternative to the ""testosterone ceiling"" of the guys' club. It's called ""Ladies in the Locker Room,"" and TV subscribers in the Atlanta, Georgia, area have been tuning in to its unique brand of sports commentary, analysis and trivia since 2004.  Watch the 'Ladies in the Locker Room' » . The show is the brainchild of Hattie Lemon, a prolific writer, director, producer and actor whose independent crime series ""Atlanta Homicide"" is featured on the CoLours TV network. ""Ladies in the locker room are not women who think they know everything about sports; they just know the men who do,"" Lemon said. It's one of the catchphrases she uses to describe the show that immediately disarms most critics who otherwise wouldn't respect an all-female sports show. ""It's all women, all sports, all sexy,"" Lemon said. ""It's a combination of my love of sports and my love of media."" Each year for the past five years, Lemon has recruited a new group of personalities and production crew members to punch out about a half-dozen shows. The show is captured live at sports clubs and restaurants across the Atlanta metro area, with additional time in the studio to create produced segments to add to the mix.  Photo gallery: Making 'Ladies in the Locker Room' » . And for the second time in the show's history, Lemon is traveling to the Super Bowl with a handful of her ladies and a production crew to create a version of the show featuring interviews with the celebrities and stars flocking to football's big game. Soma Balber, a self-professed superfan of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team and one of the show's commentators for the 2008-09 season, first got to know Lemon when she began playing a recurring role in ""Atlanta Homicide."" They got to talking about sports, and Balber was asked to be a part of the show. ""It's kind of nice to show the audience that women can have fun watching sports,"" Balber said. ""And we want to educate women about sports as well."" Lemon, who describes herself as a huge fan of professional football, says she hopes her show will lead more men to understand that women love sports, too. ""When women talk about sports, sometimes men look at us as groupies,"" Lemon said. ""Men don't think women understand sports."" As for men who have never played sports but still know all the stats? They get the ""man pass."" It's not fair, she says, but ""it is what it is. I just hope we get more women talking about sports.""",0.6138718,2874
39,"(CNN) -- Retired basketball icon Michael Jordan bought a majority share of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats, officials said Saturday. Jordan, who was already a minority owner of the team, headed a group that bought a majority share of the team from businessman Robert Johnson, Johnson said in a statement. Johnson said he has signed a ""definitive agreement"" to sell majority interest of Bobcats Sports and Entertainment to Michael Jordan and MJ Basketball Holdings, LLC. The deal is subject to NBA approval. Details on the purchase price were not available. Jordan has overseen the team's basketball operations in recent years. He won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. Johnson, who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001, announced that he had been looking for someone to buy earlier this year. His fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce, but in a 2009 interview with CNN, Johnson estimated his net worth was still $1.1 billion. Johnson's resume is full of firsts: BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE. He was the first African-American billionaire in the United States. And, in 2002, he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise.",0.6130047,9608
40,"(CNN) -- Barack Obama has talked of ripping out the White House bowling alley and replacing it with a basketball court. The former reserve player for Punahou High School's 1979 state championship team brings an enthusiasm for pickup basketball games to a place where golf, baseball and football have been the most-discussed sports. Reggie Miller says he'd pick Barack Obama for his squad because he likes the president-elect's team approach. And if he puts hoops in the White House, Reggie Miller, the retired basketball star and sports broadcaster, wants in. ""I would love to be the first to go there and play,"" said Miller, whose record-breaking 2,560 three-pointers with the Indiana Pacers electrified basketball fans. Today Miller, 43, is an NBA analyst for TNT, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, parent company of CNN. Miller and others have said Obama's playing style yields clues to the type of president he will be. Miller, who said he backed Obama in the election, spoke Monday to CNN.com. iReport.com: What would you like to ask Obama? CNN: Do you know Barack Obama? Reggie Miller: I have never met him personally, but from afar, obviously I admire the man and the courage and the strength, the wisdom. I respect how much of a family man he is. CNN: Where does basketball fit in your view of Barack Obama? Miller: It seems like he has a regular pickup game, which I like because as a ballplayer, you like to do the same routine. ... He plays with the same guys, he likes to get a good sweat in. ... When you get a good workout in, you feel good for the rest of the day. It helps clear the mind. CNN: He's a left-hander; he likes to fake right and go to the left? Miller: I've seen clips of his Punahou [high school] days, when he played in Hawaii, and I saw that HBO special with Bryant Gumbel when they had that informal game. ... He is a point guard, and most point guards are right-handed, so it would be definitely be difficult to guard a point guard that was left-handed. And in that [HBO] clip, I loved his decision-making, because it looked like he tried to get everyone involved, until it was game point and it was tied up. Obviously, the commander in chief decides the game [Obama made the winning shot], and I like it. I think that trickles down into, you let your colonels, your generals do all the little work, but when it's time to make the big decision and win the game -- then it's the commander in chief, top dog, numero uno. But I will say this, if I was playing against him in a pickup game, I would definitely force him right because it looks like he loves to go left. CNN: Does he remind you of anyone you played against? Miller: Well, it's funny because you don't play against a lot of left-handed point guards. Greg Anthony of the Knicks, a left-handed point guard from UNLV. ... [Nate] ""Tiny"" Archibald, I believe he was left-handed as well. CNN: From what you've seen, how good a player is Obama? Miller: I would not mind picking him up on my squad; if there were 10 guys and we had to pick, he could definitely be in my squad. Because he knows what his strength is -- making sure that everyone gets involved, and that's the kind of point guard I want. Those are guys like Magic Johnson, Mark Jackson, John Stockton, it's not all about them; it's about let's make sure our team is good. He's going to get the ball to everyone. CNN: Speaking of being commander in chief, what are the lessons that you take away from Obama's basketball that you think would be useful? Miller: If you look at his demeanor, he's very cool; you have to be cool under pressure. You can't make hasty decisions. You've got to look at the full picture as a whole and then you assess it. And I think from a strategic and a political standpoint, I think that very much sums up Mr. Obama. You look at him during the debate and during the campaign, he pretty much never got too high and never got too low; he just kind of stayed right in the middle. When you're making the decisions that he's going to be making, for our economy, for Iraq, Afghanistan, you want someone who's levelheaded who's going to look at the big picture, who's going to rely on his Cabinet, which would be the other players. You want them to all be on same page, which you want your starting five to be, and then you go out there and execute it. CNN: You think he's going to have an impact on the sport of basketball by example? Miller: It's not just basketball, I think sports in general. You know he's already said yes, ""I think we should have a BCS"" [playoff system for deciding the nation's college football championship], and I think everyone agrees with him. I think his love of basketball is only going to help the high school, collegiate and professional ranks. ... For sports in general, it's good to have a person in the White House who's physically fit, who loves sports but also understands and knows how to run a country. CNN: In that order? Miller: I don't know about that order. I think I would probably start with running the country first. I think what we do is more entertainment and letting people escape. I think running the country is a little more important than worrying about the BCS title game. I think getting jobs is probably first and foremost and getting our economy straight and getting our troops home, I think those are the most important things for the president-elect. But if he does find time to get a BCS playoff, that would be nice.",0.6115004,2642
41,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was among three people killed in a crash in Fullerton, California, early Thursday, according to the team and a hospital spokesman. Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was killed Thursday, hours after his fourth MLB start. Adenhart, 22, of Silver Spring, Maryland, died at UC Irvine Medical Center, according to spokesman John Murray. ""The Angels family has suffered a tremendous loss today,"" Tony Reagins, the team's general manager, said in a written statement. ""We are deeply saddened and shocked by this tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Nick's family, friends, loved ones and fans."" One person was arrested in connection with the three-vehicle accident, which occurred about 12:23 a.m. Thursday in Fullerton, south of Los Angeles. Witnesses say a red minivan ran a red light and struck two vehicles at an intersection, police Lt. Craig Brower said. One of the vehicles, a gray Mitsubishi, slammed into a power pole, Brower said. Two of its passengers were declared dead at the scene, he said. The other two were transported to UC Irvine Medical Center. Murray said Adenhart underwent surgery and died at the hospital but did not know whether he died during or after the procedure. Brower said the remaining passenger was in critical condition. The Angels said the two dead at the scene were the female driver of the Mitsubishi and another male. No other members of the Angels organization were involved, the team said. Adenhart reportedly was ""in bad condition at the scene,"" team spokesman Tim Mead said, and there wasn't much that could be done for him at the hospital. He died ""mid- to late morning,"" Mead said. A passenger in the minivan was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Brower said. The third vehicle sustained minor damage, and its driver was unhurt, he said. Police did not identify any of the dead. The minivan's driver fled the scene and was later arrested, Brower said. Andrew Thomas Gallo, 22, of Riverside will face charges of manslaughter, felony driving under the influence and hit-and-run, he said. Footage from the scene showed the minivan with a smashed front end and the Mitsubishi, which was heavily damaged. Debris littered the intersection where the crash took place, and it was cordoned off with yellow police tape. The Angels' game Thursday night with the Oakland A's was postponed at the direction of Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. No information was released as to when the game would be played. ""Major League Baseball is in mourning today upon the news of this tragedy that has taken Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others,"" Selig said in a statement. ""Nick was just 22 years of age, with a wonderful life and career ahead of him. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my sincere sympathy to the families and friends of all three victims and to the entire Angels' organization. I send my deepest condolences to Nick's parents, Jim and Janet. The hearts of everyone in baseball are with them at this most difficult time."" The Angels quoted Adenhart's family in the team statement, saying they express ""sincere gratitude for all the help the Angels have provided."" ""He lived his dream and was blessed to be part of an organization comprised of such warm, caring and compassionate people,"" Adenhart's parents said. ""The Angels were his extended family. Thanks to all of Nick's loyal supporters and fans throughout his career. He will always be in everyone's hearts forever."" Funeral and memorial arrangements were pending, the team said. Adenhart pitched in a game against the Oakland A's on Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, making a ""brilliant effort"" despite the Angels' 6-4 loss, according to MLB.com. In his fourth major league start, Adenhart pitched a scoreless six innings, with seven hits, three walks and five strikeouts. ""I thought he pitched a terrific game,"" manager Mike Scioscia told MLB.com after the game. ""He gave us a chance to win. He has better tools out there now. He pitched ahead a lot and was able to get back in counts and put guys away."" ""It felt good to work out of some jams early,"" Adenhart told MLB.com. ""My curveball was really working for me, and then my change came on later when I felt I needed it."" Jim Adenhart had flown out from Baltimore, Maryland, and was at Wednesday night's game to watch his son's start, his first of the season, Mead said. He remained in California on Thursday, and Janet Adenhart was expected to fly out later in the day. The Angels drafted Adenhart in the 14th round of the June 2004 draft, according to the team statement. He was in his fifth professional season and made the Angels' Opening Day roster for the first time. ""Adenhart earned his spot in the Angels rotation via a spring training in which he recorded a 3-0 record and a 3.12 ERA over the course of six starts,"" the team statement said. ""During that span, he struck out 18 while allowing only five base on balls."" Adenhart made his major league debut May 1 against Oakland, the team said. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the majors. Adenhart was a 2004 graduate of Williamsport High School in Williamsport, Maryland. His baseball coach there, Rod Steiner, told CNN affiliate WHAG, ""After watching last night, as well as he pitched ... things seemed to be going so smooth. This is the last thing that you ever imagine."" He remembered Adenhart as a hard worker who knew he wanted to be a major-league pitcher while still in high school and worked hard to achieve that goal, despite a setback when he had to undergo shoulder surgery. He said area residents who didn't even know Adenhart followed his career and cheered him on. ""He touched a lot of lives.""

42,"(CNN) -- North Carolina State University women's basketball coach Kay Yow, who won more than 700 games in nearly four decades of coaching, died Saturday after a long struggle with breast cancer, the university said. North Carolina State University's Kay Yow, in 1996, was one of only six coaches to amass 700 wins. She was 66. Yow, who was in her 38th season as a coach, had amassed numerous awards, including inductions into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. In her 34 years on the sidelines for the Wolfpack, her teams won four Atlantic Coast Conference titles, averaged 20 wins a season, appeared in 20 of 27 NCAA tournaments and reached the Final Four in 1998. She was one of only six coaches in the women's game to win at least 700 games, the university said. She also coached the 1988 women's Olympic basketball team to a gold medal in Seoul, South Korea. Yow was beloved by her players, colleagues and fans, and in 2007, N.C. State christened the court in Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum in her name. Since being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987, Yow had been active in efforts to raise awareness and money to battle the disease, which forced her to miss two games during the 2004-05 season and another 16 in the 2006-07 season, the university said. She helped establish the Kay Yow/WBCA Cancer Fund, which raised money for the cause. About three weeks ago, Yow announced that she was stepping away from coaching duties for the remainder of the 2008-09 season, after missing four straight games because of an extremely low energy level. ""Stepping away from coaching is one of the hardest decisions I have had to make,"" Yow said January 6, according to N.C. State. ""Even though I don't feel well enough to coach, I'm hopeful to feel well enough to attend some ACC games and show my support for the team as well as N.C. State University,"" she added. Yow was born in 1942 in Gibsonville, North Carolina, about 16 miles outside Greensboro. She began coaching at local high schools in 1964 before Elon University hired her. N.C. State hired her in 1975. ""It has been an honor and a privilege to work with Coach Yow for the last 15 seasons. I suddenly find myself grasping to retain everything she has ever said and ever taught me,"" interim head coach Stephanie Glance said, according to the university. The team's game against Wake Forest University, which was scheduled for Monday, has been postponed until February 10 in Winston-Salem, the university said.",0.6076093,3601
43,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ready for your Super Bowl party? Sure, you have drinks, hot wings, maybe even a favorite jersey. But do you have an M-16, a Kevlar helmet and body armor? Pittsburgh Steelers fan Sheresa Coleman will watch the Super Bowl from the USS Mahan in the Gulf of Aden. Not everybody is watching the game from the comfort of the family den. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops will be deployed in remote war zones, on lonely oceans and at overseas bases -- all far away from an NBC affiliate. So the military is going out of its way to make sure that many soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors can watch Super Bowl XLIII live. ""Super Bowl day has really become a holiday, military-wise, over the last couple years,"" said Petty Officer 1st Class Grant Shannon. Shannon is from a town about an hour north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but is on board the USS Mahan, a destroyer deployed to stop pirates working off the coast of Somalia. When they finish their duties, sailors like Shannon can head to the ship's mess to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals. The same is true for soldiers, Marines and airmen in combat zones. ""We can broadcast to every forward operating base in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" said Andreas Friedrich, the deputy director of Armed Forces Radio and Television Services, which has been sending the Super Bowl to troops overseas since the first Super Bowl, broadcasting it live since 1981.  Watch how troops will be able to watch big game » . All told, about 1 million American military personnel and civilians overseas will be able to watch the big game. Some of those watching will be benefiting from the same technology that makes Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle missions possible. A global broadcast system will beam the game to ships and submarines far out in the Pacific Ocean. GBS is how pilots in the United States can watch and fly an unmanned vehicle over a battlefield halfway around the world, and then feed what they see to the battlefield commanders on the ground below. Raytheon, the company that runs the system, will use one of its video channels to feed the game to several U.S. Navy submarines and ships in the Pacific. Tens of thousands of sailors will be able to see the game via GBS, which first broadcast a Super Bowl in 2003, according to Guy DuBois of Raytheon. ""It's a pretty amazing feeling, when you get to do that, to watch it on the ship and knowing that everybody else is back home having a good time, just like we will be,"" said Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Wright, a Cardinals fan from Arizona. Wright is on board the USS San Antonio, an amphibious transport dock that is part of the anti-piracy task force. A Steelers fan on board the USS Mahan agrees. ""It would be nice to be home and watch the game in my hometown,"" said Seaman Sheresa Coleman of Pittsburgh. ""But it's a great honor to support and defend the Constitution of the United States."" One thing Wright and the other overseas Super Bowl viewers will miss is the legendary Super Bowl commercials. Friedrich said the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services would have had to pay high fees for the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl commercials to an international audience. Instead, the multimillion-dollar ads that some people consider the best part of the game will be pre-empted in favor of Department of Defense-produced ads and public service messages. Still, even without seeing football-playing Clydesdales or movie-shilling monsters, those in uniform appreciate being part of America's unofficial midwinter holiday. ""We have lots of sailors and Marines on board who have followed the season,"" said Cmdr. Eric Cash, the commander of the USS San Antonio. ""Any time we can enjoy some traditional American sports like the Super Bowl, it's always a great time for us, a good mental break and also a good time for people to get together and socialize."" Just like home. But you have to wonder -- does the ship's galley have nachos or pigs in a blanket?",0.6044253,1653
44,"Editor's note: For 85 years, Yankee Stadium has hosted some of the greatest  moments in sports. On Sunday, the Yankees will play their last game before the stadium is torn down. Former Yankee pitcher Jim Bouton played on the 1963 American League All-Star team and in two World Series. He wrote the classic baseball book, ""Ball Four,"" named as one of the ""Books of the Century"" by the New  York Public Library, and has been a sportscaster and actor. For Bouton's web site, click here . Jim Bouton was photographed as a rookie in 1962 at Yankee Stadium, before the renovation of the ballpark. EGREMONT, Massachusetts (CNN) -- I'll never forget my first day in The House that Ruth Built:  April 9, 1962, the day before opening day. I made the team that spring as a non-roster player, having pitched in the Texas League (AA) the year before. And I had just turned 23. The Yankees had scheduled an afternoon workout, but I was so excited that I couldn't sleep and I drove in from my parents' house in New Jersey at 7 in the morning. After introducing myself to a skeptical guard, he led me down two flights of stairs and through a hallway, where I was greeted by the clubhouse man Pete Sheehy (who died in 1985 and for whom the room is now named). The Yankee clubhouse in 1962 was like a large subterranean living room. A wall-to-wall grayish green carpet muffled all sound, and the overhead lighting was subdued. Three walls of walk-in wood lockers faced a wall of large frosted windows that cast shafts of light from the street above. Everything was painted a muted gray green to match the carpet, including the exposed ductwork in the ceiling above. A cleat-dented wooden stool sat in front of each locker. And hanging in the lockers, with military precision, were the classic Yankee uniforms. ""Your locker is right here by the door,"" said Pete. I couldn't help smiling when I saw Whitey Ford's nameplate just one locker away. I asked Pete if this was the same room that Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and all those guys used. He pointed to a locker across the room where he used to bring ""a bi-carb and coffee"" each day to the Babe. Pete returned to his duties and I touched my uniform reverently. With no one around, I decided to try it on. Perfect fit. I adjusted my hat in a mirror. That looked good, too. iReport.com: Share your memories of Yankee Stadium . Then I grabbed my glove and went out to the field -- you know, just to get oriented. After sitting in the dugout a few minutes, I trotted out to the mound. Looking up at the three tiers of stands was like being in the Roman Coliseum. Of course, I had to toe the rubber and look in for the sign. Fortunately, at that hour of the morning, it was just me and the pigeons. What would it be like to pitch there when the stands were filled with people? My big chance came on May 7, 1962, in the second game of a double-header against the Washington Senators, in front of a real crowd that included my Mom and Dad, my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from New Jersey. I was thrilled and scared at the same time -- maybe a little more on the scared side. I walked the bases loaded with nobody out. Then I fell behind 3 and 1 on the fourth hitter. My next pitch was a little bit high and manager Ralph Houk stepped out of the dugout - either to calm me down or remove me from the premises. But the umpire, bless him, called it a strike and Houk stepped back into the dugout. The inning seemed to last forever, but I finally got out of it and ended up pitching a complete game shutout. Maybe the worst shutout in history - 7 walks and 7 hits. After the game Houk said to me, ""any more shutouts like that and we're going to need a new bullpen."" The best part was when I walked into the clubhouse after the game. I arrived a few minutes late because I'd done a TV interview in the dugout. And when I opened the door, there was a path of white towels leading to my locker -- and Mickey Mantle was laying down the last towel. This is my favorite memory of Yankee Stadium. Unless it was Mantle's 9th inning walk-off home run in '64 World Series that beat the Cardinals 2-1, which also happened to be my first World Series win. After that it was all down hill. In 1968 a sore arm got me traded to the Seattle Pilots for a bag of batting practice balls. That's the year I kept a diary that became Ball Four -- a book that also mentioned Mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium for 28 years. My eventual return to Yankee Stadium came after my son Michael wrote a letter to the New York Times, saying the Yankees should let bygones be bygones and invite me back. It was such a beautiful letter the Yankees were embarrassed into inviting me. After 28 years, Yankee Stadium was a different place -- a strange and garish place. A makeover in 1973-75, under the new owner George Steinbrenner, added cantilevered stands that destroyed the elegant upper façade, and exterior elevators which spoiled the view of the of the lower facade. Inside, the grayish green carpet was now bright blue and featured a giant Yankee logo. The honest ceiling with its exposed pipes was now a dropped ceiling with stark white tiles. Everything was painted blue and white -- the Yankee colors, get it? Now, instead of restoring the stadium, they're going to tear it down. Raze the clubhouse where Pete Sheehy made coffee for Ruth. Destroy the dugout where Stengel slept. Bulldoze the field where Mantle roamed and level the mound where Larsen pitched the only perfect World Series game. And they're going to build an underground parking garage on the site! This will no doubt be ""The Garage that Ruth Built"" -- which could produce a reverse ""Curse of the Bambino."" If you check the current standings, you'll see this may already be happening. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.",0.6037023,1548
45,"(CNN) -- Chris Nowinski's professional wrestling career didn't end with a pink slip or a celebratory sendoff, but with a swift kick to his chin. Chris Nowinski was a WWE wrestler when he suffered a concussion, but didn't realize how badly he was hurt. Nowinski played college football at Harvard -- a defensive tackle. He was a promising newcomer to World Wrestling Entertainment. At the time he suffered the injury -- the hit that would cut his career short -- he was performing in a summer 2003 tag-team match as his WWE character, Chris Harvard, a blonde, blue-eyed symbol of Ivy League elitism. Nowinski didn't know he had suffered a concussion. He didn't know that he shouldn't have been wrestling immediately afterward, and he didn't know that this was probably the sixth concussion of his athletic career. There was a lot Nowinski didn't know about concussions. Hard hits were nothing new to Nowinski, 28, a tree of a man who had played sports since childhood. Blows to the head punctuated many of the games and matches in his career, he said. Sometimes he blacked out. ""The sky would change colors, or I would see stars, and get really dizzy, and I would just collect myself on the field or in the ring, and continue going, because that's what I thought I was supposed to do,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I didn't realize that it was a serious brain injury."" Nowinski continued to wrestle, which aggravated the injury, he said. He developed post-concussion syndrome, a condition characterized by prolonged concussion symptoms. ""After my last concussion ... I was stuck with four years of headaches and immediate memory problems and depression and sleep-walking,"" Nowinski said. He said he still endures migraines and memory loss. ""My head just feels differently all the time,"" he said. Concussions are common, particularly among athletes in heavy contact sports. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 300,000 sports-related concussions occur annually in the United States. Nowinski waited a year and a half for his head to clear so he could return to the ring -- a day that never came. So, the fallen wrestler decided to change what he considers the sports world's biggest liability. He's now on a mission to eliminate the ""damage"" from head injuries in athletics. His task is two-fold: To educate coaches, parents and athletes about identifying and treating concussions and to help facilitate research to pin down the injury's long-term effects. ""I knew I had the information that could prevent suffering for a lot of people, a lot of people that I cared about,"" said Nowinski. ""It wouldn't have been right for me to just go on with my life, make money, do whatever, while that information just sat in my head."" He wrote ""Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis from the NFL to Youth Leagues,"" published in 2006. He's been speaking before youth leagues, sports conferences and other public events for more than three years. And he and a group of top neurologists have recently formed The Sports Legacy Institute. Part of that organization's purpose will be to study the effects of multiple head injuries, investigating cases of a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, Nowinski said. CTE is a dementia-like condition caused by repetitive blows to the head over an extended period of time, according to the National Institute of Health. Hoping to prove to the rest of the world that multiple concussions have permanent, sometimes ruinous consequences, Nowinski began to work with a University of Pittsburgh neuropathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, who found the condition in the brains of two deceased former National Football League players, Terry Long and Mike Webster. With Nowinski's help in obtaining the brain tissue, Omalu diagnosed the condition in two other former players who died, Andre Waters and Justin Strzelczyk. Both Long and Waters committed suicide. In the case of Waters, Omalu said, ""Major depression was the cause of his suicide ... And the underlying causation here was trauma."" But aside from the research and studies that garner headlines and national attention, a large part of Nowinski's task lies in his clear-spoken testimony. In smaller groups, in schools and other events, often away from the stare of the cameras, Nowinski tells people what he knows. Despite the repeated occurrence of concussions amid practice, games or matches, Nowinski says many coaches and players -- from youth leagues to professionals - still don't know how to properly treat concussions or even how to identify them. And what's worse, he said, just like in his case, athletes often try to play while they are still injured. A second concussion suffered while a player is recovering from the first could result in death, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Furthermore, some studies show that there are cumulative long-term effects from multiple concussions. Nowinksi says he's had mixed reactions to his message. Some, like Carmen Roda, president of the Westport, Connecticut-based PAL football program, say Nowinski's lecture is imperative for coaches. ""Bottom line, if they care about kids, they should listen to this lecture,"" Roda said. Others have shown more resistance. ""I['ll] go to schools to speak, and the football coach will refuse to show up to the talk,"" Nowinski said. But the former wrestler says the biggest hurdle to better practice and treatment of concussions are the professional sports leagues. He is particularly critical of the NFL. ""They need their best players on the field to sell tickets,"" Nowinski said. ""And a lot of these problems from playing through concussions don't show up until these guys are retired. So their incentive to protect them while they're players is not where it should be."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league puts its players' interests as first priority and the individual teams ""do an excellent job in the care and management of concussions that affect NFL players."" Dr. Joseph Maroon, the neurosurgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers and a member of the league's committee on mild-traumatic brain injury, applauds the NFL's efforts to protect its players. Asked about studies that suggest long-term damage from concussions, Maroon said there are other factors that could affect the ability of a person's brain to function normally. ""It's extremely difficult and quite impossible to ascribe problems that develop 20 or 30 years after someone played to a concussion that's experienced 20 or 30 years before,"" he said. Nowinski said players still do not understand the seriousness of concussions. They need to be educated, he said, and the ""tough-it-out"" culture inherent to football and other sports needs to change. ""If within a few years, everybody doesn't know that playing through concussions is a terrible idea, then I'll be surprised and disappointed,"" he said. ""The idea is we make the change that needs to be made as quickly as possible,"" Nowinski said. ""And then I can do something else."" E-mail to a friend .",0.6034175,2566
46,"Washington (CNN) -- When President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals' season opener on Monday, he kicked off not only a new baseball season but also a new round of fundraisers at Nationals Park. Though Obama wasn't raising any cash himself on game day, his appearance was the backdrop for at least one ballpark fundraiser Monday, the first of what Nationals President Stan Kasten hopes will be many political events held at the stadium this season. Since Nationals Park first opened in March 2008, Kasten has actively encouraged political operatives of all ideological stripes to hold their fundraisers and receptions at the ballpark, as opposed to more conventional venues such as restaurants or hotel ballrooms. ""I am absolutely bipartisan when it comes to business, or even multi-partisan,"" said Kasten in an interview with CNN. ""We welcome all, and we've had all come to the ballpark. Republicans, Democrats, and I'm sure other parties as well."" Kasten helped bring major-league baseball back to Washington in 2005 after a 34-year absence. Since then, federal candidates, major political parties, and political action committees have spent at least $432,000 on fundraising events either at Nationals games or at their facility, according to campaign finance documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. Although campaigns did spend money on Nationals-related fundraising events when the team played at RFK Stadium, the records show that spending skyrocketed once the gates opened at Nationals Park. Campaign disbursements to the Nationals for fundraising expenses averaged $11,000 per year from 2005 to 2007, but that increased by twelvefold, to about $131,000, in 2008, the year the park opened. That amount doubled to $264,000 in 2009. The total dollar amount spent on all fundraisers at Nationals Park is likely to be much higher than FEC records indicate, since lax federal disclosure rules allow campaigns to pay corporations directly for use of their luxury suites at the ballpark, without having to specify how the money was spent. However, regulations do require that campaigns pay full price for all expenses, such as tickets, suite rentals and concessions. Much of the Nationals' success in wooing the campaign crowd can be attributed to a relative lack of variety available on the Washington fundraising circuit. One Democratic fundraiser who has held two events at the ballpark told CNN that both candidates and donors enjoy the change of scenery. ""It's different. It's a good time to interact with people but also have fun while doing something non-politically related,"" she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""There is a little bit of monotony in fundraisers in D.C. There's a formula to it, so this is a little out of the ordinary."" Kasten could not agree more. ""The key to fundraisers is to get people to come,"" he said. ""We have the added element of holding an event at our ballpark and having a fun evening going on alongside the fundraiser with lots of other things to do."" ""It's just so much more appealing to potential contributors than just coming to some hotel ballroom,"" he added. The ballpark hosted over 40 fundraisers in 2009, and Kasten expects that number to increase this year with the midterm elections looming. The team advertises its facilities to individual campaign committees, congressional offices, and to national party organizations, including both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. Special outreach is made to the members and candidates representing whichever visiting team happens to be in town. Although holding fundraisers at baseball games is not new, the Nationals have capitalized on being uniquely positioned in a city with a year-round political industry unrivaled by other baseball towns. Records show that several teams with national fan bases have not received nearly as much in campaign expenditures as the $432,000 the Nationals have garnered so far. Since 2003, the Boston Red Sox have received about $207,000, the New York Yankees have received about $157,000, and the Chicago Cubs have brought in just over $36,000. The Baltimore Orioles, which had been Washington's venue of choice for baseball-themed political fundraisers prior to the arrival of the Nationals, received $134,000 during the same time period. But not everyone is sold on Nationals Park as a fundraising venue, at least as long as the team continues to perform poorly on the field. ""The allure of doing events at their games has worn off, since the home team isn't good. We usually struggle to sell tickets for Nationals games,"" said one Republican fundraiser, who asked not to be identified. ""We generally advise our clients to have other types of fundraising events that are cheaper and more successful. [Washington Capitals hockey] games sell very well right now."" On that point, Kasten, who has also headed up professional hockey and basketball franchises, says that baseball is the most conducive sport for political fundraisers. ""The pace is a little slower,"" he said. ""It gives people more of a chance to sit and think and talk typically than there is at a basketball or hockey game."" Despite his efforts to lure partisan fundraisers to his ballpark, the Nationals' top executive sees baseball as an inherently nonpartisan activity. According to Kasten, ""A ballpark is a controversy-free zone, a politics-free zone, where everyone can unify behind the idea of just having fun.""",0.59504473,9746
47,"(CNN) -- Sports stars seem to have it all -- from seven-figure salaries to big endorsement deals. But lately, what some don't have is a good reputation. The NBA's Dwyane Wade started a foundation to help inspire kids in at-risk situations. With the steroids controversy in baseball and drug allegations against the world's greatest swimmer, many adoring fans may wonder, ""Where are the good guys in sports?"" Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat is one of those good guys. He stays out of the controversy and insists that his fame should be used to help others. CNN's Nicole Lapin talked to the NBA star about the foundation he started and his partnership with National Recess Week. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Nicole Lapin: It feels like you're getting paid for recess now. You're 27 years old. Do you look at your paycheck sometimes and are like, ""I get paid for this?  Watch more of Nicole Lapin's interview with Dwyane Wade » . Dwyane Wade: First of all, to do something that you love, and to get compensated for something that you love at a very, very great rate, is unbelievable. And it's something that a lot of kids dream of. They've just got to have somebody who believes in them. And that's something I'm trying to do with being the spokesman for this Recess Week. Y'all need to get back out there. We need to get back out there with the kids and help them believe in themselves. Lapin: Some people see you as the role model. Who was your role model growing up? Wade: You know, I had different role models growing up. Of course, I'm from Chicago, so when it comes to sports and when it comes to basketball, Michael Jordan. No question about it. But, you know, on a personal level, I always looked at people that were close to me that were doing things. My sister was always a role model to me, just because of the way that she always helped kids. And even though we didn't have much, she always helped the ones that were less fortunate than us. And it's something that just stuck with me. And it's something that I'm trying to do now. Lapin: So, as a role model, to take little kids wearing your jerseys and playing video games of you, do you take that seriously? Wade: It's still, you know, crazy to me when I see people wearing my jersey. I mean, just on a regular day. Not a game day. Just on a regular day walking down the street, see somebody with your name on their back. It's like, wow. Or when you see yourself on video games. All that to me is still, you know, mind-blowing. And the main thing, the only thing you can do is try to go out and talk to kids. You try and tell them the importance of being you. You try and tell them the importance of being a certain way. You try and give them the message that a lot of people gave you. Lapin: In 2003, you started Wade's World to help those kids, to talk to those kids. Because you were never talked to when you were growing up. Wade: Yes, yes. I never was. It may have helped me out; helped my drive out. But unfortunately, I've never had anyone come to the community I grew up in and give out that helping hand. And to give us hope, in our community, that we can do something special. I always heard that we couldn't or you know, it's one in a million or something like that. Well, our job and my job at the Wade's World foundation is to go out and let these kids know that we believe in them. And there's more than what you see out your front window or your front door that's in life. And you can do anything you want. Lapin: You said on your bio that you want to leave the world a better place. You think you've done that? Wade: I think I've got a lot more ""doing"" to do. Lapin: What do you want to do? Wade: I think the main thing you think of is to know you can change the whole world, but you can touch many people on the way. And my main thing is like, when I go out and talk to kids or I do different events through my foundation, I just want to change one person's thought in that room. They had a negative thought or belief coming in, I want to make them believe. And if I can change one kid's mind, he can change someone else's mind, and it can be a chain effect that can continue to keep going.",0.59315556,4766
48,"(CNN) -- Basketball is often viewed as a game of opposing sides. But one man is using the game to bring young Catholic and Protestant men together on the same team in Belfast, Northern Ireland. After graduating college, Michael Evans coached basketball at two high schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Former college basketball player, Michael Evans, 26, in partnership with another basketball player, Dave Cullen, created the organization Full Court Peace to help forge friendships between between schools in the divided communities. He spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about how Full Court Peace works. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Lapin: So you wanted to use basketball as a bridge but you started Full Court Peace almost to dupe these youngsters into working together? Evans: Yea that's one way to put it. I think what I did was I just coached basketball separately in two high schools. And, uh, on the opposite sides of these walls I've been talking about. And I got roughly five on each side to latch on to me. These 16-year-old boys. You know, they came from broken homes and I showed them loyalty. That's what coaches do, is show their players loyalty and the kids latched on to me, so much that I was able to sell the idea of making an integrated team out of their enemies and it was a complete success.  Watch more on Michael Evan's organization » . Lapin: They didn't think that they were going to work with the other side. Like Robert, for example, one of your players who is Protestant. What did he think when he was going to work with a Catholic team? Evans:That was a pretty discouraging moment throughout the whole process of forming that team. I told Robert the news and he shunned me. He couldn't believe that the time I'd spent with him alone was really just basically me trying to convince him to join this team. I thought I might have lost him. Lapin:  Now he's also friends with the other side to this day. There was a little bit of hesitation at first, I know they did speak, but are they still friends? Evans:They are still friends. I recently went back to Belfast and had dinner with a lot of them all together. And the ones that couldn't meet for the integrated dinner asked about their team mates. The neighborhoods are too divided for them to visit each other so they communicate a lot online through bebo.com which is a social networking site over there. And they keep up with each other. They're not bashful about having pictures of each other, arm-in-arm on their social networking sites, and they communicate through me about each other because I'm in touch with all of them. Lapin: So that's amazing, Michael. How do you think you do this? How does sports diplomacy, which is really what this is, succeed where world leaders, prime ministers and presidents have failed? Evans: I mean just because a politician, two politicians come together and say they agree on something, it doesn't mean that the people on the ground are going to be agreeing on it. And most importantly the youth that are growing up in these environments, that doesn't mean that they agree with what's going on. So that's sort of just a face to the whole solution. I think what sport does, namely basketball, is that you put kids in a small, very small group together and they're forced to communicate in order to succeed; in order to win. And then the coaches role is very unique in that the kids all bond over having one voice and one person telling them what to do and guiding them along and helping them with success.",0.5845494,1839

50,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is not often that football players are actively encouraged to play dirty -- unless of course they are taking part in a unique variant of the game called ""Swamp Soccer"" when it is virtually unavoidable. The competition is fierce in the 2009 Swamp Soccer World Championship held in Scotland . Originating from the bogs of Finland, the game was started by cross-country skiers who used the football matches in knee-deep mud to strengthen their leg muscles.  The first tournament took place in 1997 with 13 teams, but now annual events take place in Sweden, Iceland, Russia and Brazil which can often feature over 200 teams.  What do you think of Swamp Soccer? Do you prefer Beach Football of another form of the game? Let us know your thoughts on the 'Sound off' box below. Glasgow Rangers fan Stewart Miller imported the concept to the United Kingdom after a chance meeting with founder Jyrki Vaananen while on a business trip to Iceland. Miller launched the first UK tournament in 2005 and now teams travel from all over the globe to the Scottish village of Strachur to try and become the annual Swamp Soccer World Champions.  Watch the action from the bog ». ""We had teams coming from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand to take part in the tournament this year so there is an international flavor to the event,"" Miller told CNN. ""There is a huge appetite to try out new things and I think that's why Swamp Soccer is able to capture the imagination of people. ""The basic rules of football also apply to Swamp Soccer with the exception that matches are played in thick mud with six players on an oversized five-a-side pitch. ""It's probably one of the only sports in the world where the worse the conditions are the better the sporting spectacle!"" There is no offside in Swamp Soccer while kick-offs, throw-ins, corner kicks, free kicks and penalties are taken by using the hands to drop the ball onto a chosen foot. Teams are also allowed to make unlimited substitutions although no shoe changing is allowed for the match duration. Miller believes that the oft-used quote that the state of a pitch can bridge the gap between two unevenly match teams is even more applicable with Swamp Soccer. ""You could put the Brazilian national side up against an amateur team and you wouldn't know who would come out on top -- the pitch really does prove to be a leveler in this instance,"" he said. ""Although professional footballers are precious commodities these days -- I'm not sure we'll see any stars getting caked in mud too soon, most of them are far to pampered for that. ""Nobody's ever been injured seriously playing in the swamp, sometimes somebody's got a cut or two but nothing big -- so maybe when they retire from the game they might be prepared to give it a go."" The imaginatively titled Real Mudrid, Mudchesthair United and Cowdungbeath were unable to make it past the group stages in the 44-team event which was won by FC Full Gunge from Poole in England who retained their title with a 1-0 victory over The Chocolate Men. This year's Swamp Soccer tournament was held in a village in the Scottish countryside but Miller revealed that he intends to bring the mud game to metropolitan areas. He added: ""The future for Swamp Soccer is in the city and of course I'm certain we'll bring all the mud with us. It will certainly make a great spectacle if set up a swamp in the middle of Glasgow or Edinburgh, so watch this space.""

53,"New York (CNN) -- To the delight of fans back home in Tokyo, Hideki Matsui drove in six of the New York Yankees' seven runs in their World Series-winning victory Wednesday and became the first Japanese-born player to win a series Most Valuable Player award. For much of his career, Matsui was a star player for the Tokyo Giants. Matsui's key role in the series highlights the close ties between American and Japanese baseball. Playing in the Yankees' new stadium, the successor to the ""House that Ruth Built,"" Matsui's performance brought to mind the key role that Babe Ruth played in the development of professional baseball in Japan, according to Robert Fitts, author of several books on Japanese baseball. Fitts became a student of Japanese baseball in 1993, when his wife, an attorney, was transferred to Japan. Fitts, then working on his Ph.D. in archaeology from Brown University, was looking for something to get him immersed in Japanese culture. He wrote to 30 of the greatest Japanese ballplayers and was surprised to hear back from nearly all of them, with some sending gifts. He's the author of ""Remembering Japanese Baseball: An Oral History of the Game"" and of ""Wally Yonamine,"" a biography of the first Japanese-American to play professional football and the first American to play professional baseball in Japan. ""He was called the Jackie Robinson of Japan,"" Fitts said. Yonamine led the Japanese league in batting twice and won the MVP award as a center fielder for the Tokyo Giants. CNN spoke with Fitts, who is based in New York, on Thursday. CNN: What are your thoughts on Matsui's key role in the Yankees' victory? Fitts: It's wonderful for Japanese baseball, of course. I would say that five years ago, maybe seven years ago, it would have been incredible, because people in America and in Japan weren't sure about the status of Japanese professional baseball. Many Americans and some in Japan thought that Japanese baseball wasn't as good as American baseball. ... Since then, Ichiro [Suzuki] came over, and he set numerous Major League Baseball records. ... And then Japan won both of the World Baseball Classics. So Japan's baseball has already proven itself to be of high caliber. Most Americans, even if they don't know the history of Japanese baseball, recognize now that they play a very good game. CNN: In Japan, how significant is baseball? Fitts: It's the Japanese national sport. It's been so since the 1890s. Japan had no native team sports. In the 1870s. American and British teachers introduced team sports to Japan. Cricket was introduced, along with rugby and baseball. Baseball is the one that became the most popular. In the 1890s, a Japanese high school team beat a team of American adults from the Yokohama Country Club. They beat them in three straight games. It took on national importance. Japan, of course, was opened up to Westerners in the 1850s by Commodore Perry. The Western nations were far more advanced in technology, and Japan did a rapid modernization. By 1890, Japan felt it was ready to join modern nations as an equal, but the Western powers weren't ready to accept Japan. CNN: How did the game develop after that? Fitts: The biggest change came with two tours. The first was in 1931, an American all-star team whose big star was Lou Gehrig, and the bigger tour came in 1934. Both of these tours were sponsored by the Yomiuri newspaper. In 1934, they brought over what at the time was considered the greatest baseball team ever. It included Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Charlie Gehringer, Earl Averill, Lefty Gomez, Connie Mack was the manager, and we can't forget Mo Berg, the future spy [for the United States in World War II]. The '34 tour was significant for two reasons: The first is that relations between Japan and the U.S. were really rocky at that point. There was a very significant treaty, the naval treaty, which limited the size of the major powers' navies. For every five warships the U.S. and Britain could have, Japan was only allowed three. Japan found this quite insulting, even though they had agreed to it in the 1920s. When the all-star team went over there, the Japanese people went crazy. Half a million people turned out on November 2 for a welcoming parade in Tokyo for the American baseball team. The tour really did create a great deal of goodwill. However, that ended quickly. Within a month of the tour ending, Japan announced that it would not renew the naval treaty. Several months later, in February 1935, an ultranationalist group tried to assassinate the president of the Yomiuri newspaper because he brought over the American team. He was wounded very seriously but survived. CNN: What was the importance of the tour for Japanese baseball? Fitts: The Yomiuri newspaper used the enthusiasm generated by the tour to start their own professional league. The first team they created -- to play the American visitors -- was a Japanese all-star team called All-Nippon. After the tour, the All-Nippon team transformed into the Yomiuri [Tokyo] Giants. CNN: What was Babe Ruth's role? Fitts: Babe Ruth was credited as the man who helped start Japanese [professional] baseball. He was just Babe Ruth. He sold out every game. He had just been released by the Yankees prior to the tour. He hit over .300; he led the Americans and Japanese for most home runs. CNN: How did Hideki Matsui become a baseball star in Japan? Fitts: He was signed right after high school. He was the hero of the annual high school tournament. His rookie year was 1993 with the Yomiuri Giants. He spent much of '93 in the minors. By 1994, he became a true star, and he was the face of the team from '94 till he came over to the Yankees in 2003. CNN: How did people feel about Matsui coming to the Yankees? Fitts: The vast majority of people were very happy for him. There was no sense of betrayal except for the true Giants fans. This was very exciting news. I was there when it happened. This was a chance for Japan's most popular player to prove himself in the major leagues. The Yankees are a special team in Japan just like they are in the U.S. They're probably the most popular American team in Japan. When [Hideo] Nomo first came over in 1995, I found my Japanese friends only cared about how the Japanese players did. They were a fan of the Dodgers one day when Nomo pitched; they were a fan of the Angels when [Shigetoshi] Hasegawa pitched, but over time the Japanese fans became fans of different major league teams as they watched more major league baseball on TV. CNN: What have been the differences between the American and Japanese games? Fitts: There were real substantial differences from the 1940s even through the early 1990s. ... The Japanese would sacrifice bunt far more than the Americans (they still do but less than they used to). Players didn't go first to third on singles often. They would play line drives on hops rather than trying to make a shoestring catch and risk giving up more bases. It was a very conservative brand of baseball. Since the ties have become closer, Japan's baseball has become more aggressive, more exciting, in my opinion. There are still differences. The Japanese really focus on practice and perfection of the technique. That's something American players can learn from, and I think it helps explain the success of Hideki Matsui and Ichiro. They're both dedicated players who practice many, many hours. If you watch Matsui at the plate, he's a very disciplined hitter. His swing is very compact, very practiced, almost perfect. He rarely makes mental mistakes when he's playing the field or running the bases. CNN: How do you think people view the fact that he's going to be a free agent and might not stay with the Yankees? Fitts: I think the Japanese people would be very disappointed if he doesn't remain a Yankee ... and I think most New Yorkers would be very disappointed, too. He's an extremely classy player and a classy individual. CNN: Were you rooting for the Yankees? Fitts: I'm a Phillies fan. I grew up in Philadelphia. I'm in mourning this morning, but at least it was Matsui who did the damage.",0.57709277,8808
54,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An English football club is being forced to close a stand at its 25,000-seat stadium to cut costs, in what could be the first of many similar moves at other clubs, a sports business expert predicts. Darlington Arena, home of English club side Darlington F.C., where a stand will be closed to cut costs. The affected club, Darlington F.C., is currently in seventh place in League Two, however, it slumped into administration last week following problems attracting crowds to the home matches. The average home crowd at the stadium is currently below 3000 people. Ticket prices are £16 ($22) per adult. The move to close the west stand at its ground, Darlington Arena, is an attempt to improve the atmosphere and cut costs at the club, the side's commercial director, Christine Balford, said on the club's Web site. Balford said the move was forced by administrators. ""This is an attempt to improve the atmosphere at home games, whilst saving costs. ""All season ticket holders will be temporarily relocated and will be able to use the facilities of the south stand,"" Balford said. Darlington F.C. has also increased the cover price of match day programs and has cut the number of complimentary tickets given away for home matches. Professor Simon Chadwick, director of the Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, UK, told CNN that many football clubs may soon find themselves in the position of having to make a similar move. ""This is the economic reality of having to strip costs. ""Generally, League One and League Two and even some Premier League clubs may be affected. What you will start to see is other clubs having to follow suit."" Chadwick said Darlington's case was a particularly bad one as they had a stadium which was far too big for the club's size. However, the issue of crowds not filling stadiums was a wider concern for many clubs. ""This is their life-blood. A lot of their revenue comes from selling tickets ...if they're not filling stadiums then it is a big issue for them,"" he said. Chadwick said closing stands could help cut match-day costs and was often a more palatable option for fans, rather than selling players.",0.5719579,3405
55,"(CNN) -- She's petite, she's middle-aged, she's bookish, and if she gets a chance, she'll knock you on your keister. Beth Hollis, second from left, is a librarian who's become a MegaBeth, a roller derby dynamo. By day, she's Beth Hollis, a 53-year-old reference librarian in Akron, Ohio. By night, she's MegaBeth, an ageless dynamo on the roller derby rink. ""All my life, when I tell people I'm a librarian, they say, 'You don't look like a librarian,' "" Hollis said. ""And now that I'm a roller derby girl, they say, 'You don't look like a roller derby girl, either.' So I don't know where I fit in."" Hollis has been fitting in at the Akron-Summit County Library for 27 years. ""She's my hero,"" said Diane Barton, 48, who has worked with Hollis at the library for 18 years. ""I just think it's so cool she's doing something so different and so active and so aggressive. You know how we are. We're librarians, so we tend to have that meek and mild stereotype.""  Watch her in action as Beth and MegaBeth » . Before discovering roller derby, Hollis had been casting about for a hobby. ""I tried knitting and literally got kicked out of the knitting class for just not being able to get the hang of it,"" she chortled. ""I guess it was just too soon for me to try knitting. I needed something that maybe was a little bit more physical for a hobby."" Boy howdy. She visited a Rubber City Rollergirls practice last winter after telling her husband, Warren, a retired high school math teacher, that she was going to an audition. ""At that point, I just said, 'I don't care that I have an AARP card in my wallet; I'm going to go for this,' "" she said. Roller derby is a real sport, having ditched the campy, WWE-like spectacle seen on TV in the early 1970s. The Rubber City squad practices six hours a week and competes against teams in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. A roller derby match, called a bout, consists of two 30-minute halves. Each team has four blockers and one player called a jammer, whose job is to get past the other team's blockers on a 235-foot oval flat track and lap them to score points. Both teams are on offense and defense simultaneously, and the action is fast and rough. ""I think she's awesome,"" coach Brian ""Coachise"" Phillips said. ""She is 53, so she is our oldest girl on the team, but she works every bit as hard as every other girl on the team, and she is in as good a shape if not better than every other girl on the team."" And she's an inspiration to the other players. ""It makes me actually excited to think that I could play ... for another 30 years, and that's awesome for me, because this is like my favorite thing to do,"" said Barb ""Barbonic Plague"" Brown, who at 21 is the youngest player on the team. Hollis has earned the respect of her team captain, too. ""She's so tiny -- she's probably like 5 feet 4 and maybe 110 pounds or so -- but when she's out there, she's MegaBeth,"" said Tracy ""Eighty-SixHer"" Soulsby, 40. ""I wouldn't say she's a very hard hitter, but she's a good blocker. Her strength is getting in people's way and then keeping them behind her, not letting them get around her."" The MegaBeth legend grew during a June bout with the Glass City Roller Girls, a team from Toledo, Ohio. Hollis found herself contending with a 6-foot-1, 220-pound foe who goes by the name Pamazon. ""Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her just take out this one girl, and I remember, the crowd just went wild. It was fantastic!"" Brown recalled. ""I think that might be the highlight of her season,"" Phillips said. For her part, Pamazon -- aka Pamela Keppler -- said she's never been knocked down in a bout. ""To be completely honest, I don't remember MegaBeth that well from the bout,"" she said. ""I do remember talking with her at the after-party. We were all pretty surprised by her age, and I remember her saying that I knocked the snot out of her."" The team draws capacity crowds of 500 to 600 at its bouts, where admission costs $8.50 to $12.50 and concessions are sold. ""It really makes it exciting when you've got all those people cheering,"" Hollis said. ""And as we progress through the season, it's obvious that we've gotten better ... and the fan support has just gotten louder."" But the glory comes at a cost. Two Rubber City Rollergirls have suffered broken legs -- in practice! -- and one is about to return after breaking her shoulder and nose in a bout. ""It's inevitable that you're going to get scrapes; you get rink rash and bruises,"" said Hollis, who wears number 796.21 -- the Dewey Decimal library index number for skating. ""I took a pretty tough fall to my hip that had me a little concerned. As I said to my teammates, at my age when you break a hip, it's the beginning of the end."" Asked whether she has hurt anyone else, the mother of two college graduates replied furtively: ""I hope so."" Librarian Hollis isn't the only player smashing stereotypes. Among her teammates are teachers, a Starbucks manager, an accountant, a nurse practitioner, a barmaid and a couple of waitresses, most of whom are on the small side, Soulsby said. ""It's not just rough-and-tough, big, burly gals out on parole,"" Hollis said. Perhaps just to keep it real, the team does include one former repo driver (Valcano) and a heavy-equipment operator (BulldozeHer Bo). Barton, her fellow librarian, says there's something different about Hollis since she laced up her skates. ""It may just be my imagination, but she seems more confident in a way,"" Barton said. ""It has to empower you somehow."" Hollis says it's good for people to test themselves with change. ""I encourage people to pursue things -- something like this -- that they think might be fun, and not to let stereotypes get in the way of whether or not they think they're going to fit in,"" she said. ""Because you never know.""",0.565876,7293
56,"(CNN) -- Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick is expected to plead guilty to federal conspiracy charges involving an illegal dogfighting operation, according to one of his attorneys. Leah Perry, who sent this photo of son Bobby and dog Rosie, thinks Vick should not be allowed back on the field. The plea deal may include prison time, but the NFL has not yet decided what football sanctions, if any, it should impose on Vick, a spokesman said. We asked CNN.com readers whether they thought Vick would -- or should -- play professional football again as well as their opinions on the case.  Below is a selection of those responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Stephanie King of Arlington, Washington Michael Vick is a disgrace. For anyone thinking he should be let off easy for admitting his guilt -- think again. The only reason he did that was because he knew the evidence against him was so great. Remember only shortly ago he was stating vehemently that he ""only owned"" the property and had no idea what was going on there. It wasn't until the eyewitness accounts were brought to light that he ""apologized."" One cannot be ""sorry"" for torturing and killing animals. As you know it's been proven that those with the ability to do so also have a stronger chance of being abusive to humans. How can we allow someone like that to be a role model for children? If we do we're degrading our society and shame on us. Patricia Reese of Paola, Kansas Yes, I think Mr. Vick should be allowed to play football again. He is a talented individual and it would be a shame to waste that talent. I also believe he should be able to rebuild his life. However, as part of his restitution to society, I believe he should contribute at least 40% of his salary for what could have potentially been his maximum jail sentence to the Humane Society to help abused and abandoned animals. Debbie Clayton of Greensboro, North Carolina He should never be allowed to play [in the] NFL or earn a dime associated with the NFL. He should be made to work so many hours per week, every week, at minimum wage at an Animal Shelter. Jeff Wise of Atlanta, Georgia Why not give him a chance to play again? Seriously how many chances has the NFL given to Ricky Williams? Smoking pot is against the law, but he's been given a number of chances, and STILL isn't banned from the NFL! Jeremy Montgomery of Mount Laurel, New Jersey I think that Vick should not be allowed to step on the field again and any endorsement deals revoked. What he did was reprehensible. He is in a spotlight where he should be held at a higher standard for a role model. Josh Hebert of Loganville, Georgia He should take whatever punishment our government gives him, but when he has done his time (if he does do time) he should be able to continue playing football. The charges against him are not football related in any way. Angela Ziegler of Cleveland, Ohio The NFL needs to ""step up to the plate"" and be the man that Michael Vick is not. Allowing him in their league gives a signal that animal abuse is OK with them. Remember Jeffrey Dahmer started as an animal abuser! Want him as your role model or a spokesman? Kelly Koch of Holland, Michigan The NFL and all sponsors should refrain from any future contact with Michael Vick. I, for one, will boycott those with future dealings with him. John Robinson of Redmond, Washington Pro athletes are constantly getting in trouble with the law. Unless we make a policy that all players who are convicted of a felony are banned from the league, then Vick should be allowed to play after a suspension. Randy Jonson of Stamford, Connecticut Until I know the depth of the gambling angle it's hard to be certain. Dog fighting is brutal but if it's only dog fighting/killing, he should get whatever the feds give him and be able to return to football once his debt is paid. Bill Saray of Derby, Connecticut Vick should never play again. He wasn't the best QB to begin with. Anyone with such a blatant disregard for life -- animal or human -- is not worthy of the position in life he was given. Playing in the NFL is not a right. As such, the league should ban him permanently, while society should shun him publicly. If only scarlet letters were still around. Todd Morrison of Howell, Michigan Mr. Vick should be judged of his crime. Not by his fame, nor his race. He should be prosecuted as a person. I believe Mr. Vick's NFL playing days should be determined by the NFL commissioner with consideration of the NFL's personal conduct policy. This is how everyone should be treated in America. Everyone is equal regardless of popularity, fame, and race. Lance G. of Dearborn Heights, Michigan First off, I am an African-American ... this is NOT a race issue. I wish the ignorant people here in the U.S. would get off that tip. This is not an issue to raise the ""race"" card. Even his so-called homies (who were all black) turned on him. Vick ... committed a felony and now he has to pay for it. He should have chosen a better hobby in life than dog fighting. As for playing football ... he should be banned from the league for at least 2 to 3 years, including his jail time. Leah Perry of Chelmsford, Massachusetts I don't think Vick should be allowed to play football, nor should he get off easy. After he serves his sentence, I think he should work at the MSPCA [to] make him see what cruelty to animals really looks like in all aspects. Steven Todd of Fort Wayne, Indiana I think Michael Vick will play football again, though at what level is anybody's guess. I do not think he should be banned for life. He may have gambled, but not on the game as Pete Rose did. A suspension is in order and I think a year would be fair, but a prison term and suspension would put him out of football for up to three years, and who knows what kind of QB he will be after this ordeal and so long an absence? Jennifer Runyan of Fayetteville, North Carolina I think the whole Michael Vick case is disgusting. The NFL needs to ban him permanently. He shouldn't be able to use the obscene amount of money he makes to torture innocent animals. Kids looked up to him and how many of them will think that abuse is OK now? I don't think he deserves to play ever again. I applaud the people sending Michael Vick jerseys into the Atlanta Humane Society to use cleaning the kennels, now that's appropriate! Watch what a dog thinks of his Vick jersey . Debbie Connor of Whitesville, Kentucky No, he should not be granted the right to play pro football again! He was given the ""Golden"" key to a life of fame and riches and he blew it away. He should be working for the road department, picking up ""Road Kill"" off the streets! Julio Hernandez of Kalamazoo, Michigan He needs to be banned from the NFL forever. These ""men"" are role models for the youth of this country. What kind of message would we be sending to them if we were to let him play in the NFL again? Not a good one, I can tell you that much. He's through. And if he's not, I certainly won't be watching any Falcons games, or for that matter any team he may eventually play for. Nichelle Williams of Woodbridge, Virginia If Imus is going to return back to the air ... then Vick should return to the field. You violate some people or beings; you apologize, let the air clear and go on with business as usual! John Brandon of Old Hickory, Tennessee To make a long story short -- my family will never watch a game with Michael Vick in attendance. E-mail to a friend .",0.5580569,329
57,"(CNN) -- Spongy red balls wait in a queue, separating two teams wired to smack their opponent. Within seconds, the players dip and dive like dolphins until one player stands alone, relishing in victory. An adult plays in a dodge ball league organized by the . City of Sparks Parks and Recreation in Nevada. It's the classic game of dodge ball, but these aren't fifth-graders during PE class in Sparks, Nevada. The childhood sport of dodge ball made a comeback four years ago in this bedroom community among adults in their 20s and 30s -- and even a few players who reached retirement. Now, hundreds of working professionals, doctors, lawyers and teachers congregate at the local recreation center for a dose of dodge ball on Sunday nights. ""I think a lot of it goes back to trying to stay young,"" said Tony Pehle, recreation supervisor in Sparks, who started the dodge ball program after being inspired by the 2004 Ben Stiller movie ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."" ""They might be adults, but they still like to play and have fun."" Has Peter Pan syndrome come to stay? From playing dodge ball to jumping double Dutch and competing in rock-paper-scissors, adult men and women, from urban nests to rural towns, are reveling in games and activities once thought to be child's play. The 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest in Orlando, Florida, this weekend (August 13)  is all grown up, attracting more than 150 adult competitors, who can showcase dizzying tricks with the flick of a finger. Later in the month, hundreds of adults outfitted in pirate and animal costumes will race their homebuilt vehicles for Oregon's annual Portland Adult Soapbox Derby, a crafty activity that began for youths in the 1930s. ""Once a year, I get to build something for the kid in me,"" says Jason Hogue, a 41-year-old carpenter, who has participated in the race for eight years. Last year, he constructed a car shaped like a hammerhead shark. ""We get to use our creativity and get excited with our friends."" Whether they're done to seek refuge from the daily grind or to provide nostalgia for youthful days -- or they're a product of what some experts say is a generation that can't grow up -- these juvenile pastimes are getting more popular. For example, adult viewership of the Nickelodeon show ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" swelled by 51 percent from 1999 to 2009, officials say. The World Adult Kickball Association, one of the largest kickball organizations, has spread its tentacles to 33 states as well a soldier division in Iraq. WAKA Kickball began as a casual game between a few young single friends in their 20s in Washington, D.C. Now, the games appeal to tens of thousands of adults, many of them yuppies wanting a quick escape from the stresses of their first 401(k), mortgage and job. ""I played soccer growing up, and I like competition,"" says avid kickball player Marlon LeWinter, 28, of New York City. LeWinter, a public relations executive, usually plays the position of center with a bunch of producers, writers and analysts in their late 20s. They named their team Chipwich Nation after they scarfed down the cookies-and-ice cream treat at a bar after a game one night. ""Sometimes when it's [the score] two to one in a kickball came, I get the jitters,"" he says. The economic bind also creates a favorable environment for adults to latch onto simple children's games and sports. With players who are trapped in a world of layoffs and job freezes, these adult leagues, contests and tournaments are the equivalent of sandbox time for children. They can make new friends and go for a beer after the game. These activities are also budget-friendly, costing less than $100 to join for several months of play -- much less than a golf club membership. Since the recession, Duncan Toys, one of the biggest yo-yo manufacturers in the United States, has seen sales spike. A company official noticed many of the adults who purchased yo-yos tried to get the same models they owned as kids. ""Nowadays, everything is taken so seriously that people revert to something like playing with a yo-yo,"" says Mike McBride, a 34-year-old multimedia designer who picked up the activity shortly after college. McBride, who will compete in the Orlando World Yo-Yo contest, says the activity helps him relieve stress. ""There's no pressure."" In 2006, Christopher Noxon, in his book ""Rejuvenile,"" explored why adults fancy childhood pursuits like kickball, cartoons and cupcakes. Beginning with Generation X adults in the 1990s, the group began to shift from the norms of the hierarchal corporate ladder, and the age of marriage began to steadily climb. Soon, juvenile activities that had been regarded as silly became hip. Quirky became cool, and more organized teams, groups and competitions for playground sports and childlike hobbies emerged. ""Our whole idea of adulthood has changed,"" says Noxon. ""We value flexibility and creativity, and these are things kids are good at. It's brought us back to what we had as children."" But it isn't just the younger generations that clutch leftovers from their youth or become interested in child-like activities. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s still collect roomfuls of model train sets, romanticizing the days when the only way to travel was by choo-choo. Women in their 40s acquire American Girl dolls that stir fond memories of reading the novels during childhood. Psychology experts say it shouldn't be a surprise that the affinity for childhood hobbies and activities extends across generations. After all, Americans have long had an obsession with youth. To be young is associated with being fun, vibrant and active. In the Internet age, finding one's inner child has never been easier, with the proliferation of social networks such as Facebook or Web sites like Meetup.com, where users can create groups and meeting times for activities. On the site, groups of adults organize scavenger hunts in Atlanta, Georgia, and action figure discussions in New York City. ""This is a generation of people who are far less homogenous and more niche-oriented,"" says Judith Sills, a clinical psychologist who works with young adults. ""They can bond around their quirky differences. Ten years ago, you couldn't have easily found another kickball player, even if you wanted to play.""",0.5574903,5952

60,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Graeme Le Saux played more than 400 matches for Blackburn, Chelsea and Southampton, winning a Premier League title and 36 international caps. CNN's Don Riddell talks to the former England star about homophobia and racism in the game. Graeme Le Saux, pictured here playing for Chelsea, endured homophobic abuse throughout his career due to false rumors he was gay. Don Riddell: Graeme, you're happily married with two children but during your football career everyone thought you were gay and the experience was pretty miserable. Graeme Le Saux: The culture of football back in the 80s was very different, something I found very hard to relate to and subsequently I found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people. That eventually led to rumors being spread that I was gay. In the context of modern life that's not defamatory but in terms of the dressing room culture that existed then -- and to an extent now -- it was very difficult for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career. I think that the joke very quickly got out of hand. And I think where I was at fault was that I was probably a little sensitive about it, because I could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control. And it did. We played in a game at West Ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and I remember being, you know, really, really shocked that it got to that level so quickly. DR: And that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving Robbie Fowler. Tell me about that? GS: It all culminated in a game that we played at Stamford Bridge against Liverpool and Robbie Fowler, he stood in front of 40,000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him... That's the politest way I can put it! That really was the point at which it couldn't get any worse. It wasn't just people singing on the terrace, it was a colleague -- an international colleague -- humiliating you in front of all those people, an international audience. He will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point. If you look at anything like this, whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever, as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue. I'm all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you can't hide behind that as an excuse. DR: It's thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay. That was the Englishman Justin Fashanu and he committed suicide a decade ago. John Amaechi became the first gay player to be associated with the NBA last year, but such declarations are extremely rare. In many cases homosexuality remains pro sport's last taboo. GS: It's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport. If you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics, across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still isn't and I find that disappointing. There may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment. DR: Football's obviously made great strides, certainly in Britain, in the last 10 years with regards to racism, but how much prejudice is there generally in the game? Do you think we'll ever be free of it? GS: I think there's always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice. But ultimately I think it's important for any business really to be responsible, inclusive and representative of its employees. And football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example. And so I hope that, you know, the people in authority really make some serious attempts, I suppose to create parity between all walks of life. DR: We've come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse aren't really racist, they are just trying to put us off our game. How much do you buy into that approach? GS: Well, I can't speak for individual black players! But sometimes I think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual. It used to baffle me when I first started playing that you'd have Chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the Chelsea's team. And if you spoke to them or confronted them about it, they would be like, ""Oh yeah, but we know them... they are, you know, they are fine."" And it's like, well how do you pick the bones out of that? Because there is just no logic. But then you know prejudice is built on ignorance. You know it really is. I think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say, ""Well, would I like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse?""",0.5501766,719
61,"(CNN) -- The City of Brotherly Love isn't exactly embracing the news that one-time quarterback phenom and convicted dogfighter Michael Vick is joining their Philadelphia Eagles. Former Atlanta Falcon Michael Vick, right, was known more for his elusiveness than his throwing prowess. Vick's agent announced Thursday that the former Atlanta Falcon signed a two-year deal with the Eagles, which reportedly could be worth more than $6 million. He won't be able to play a regular season game until week six in October, and then, only if the National Football League fully reinstates him. ""Too bad they don't have him for the whole year,"" Eagles fan Charles James told CNN affiliate philly.com. The NFL indefinitely suspended Vick in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation in Virginia. Vick, 29, left a Kansas prison in May to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. Some Eagles fans don't think Vick's punishment was sufficient and were trying to unload their game and season tickets on craigslist.com, making it clear they were less than eager to see Vick in Philly green. iReport.com: What do you think of Vick's return? A post from one irked fan looking to peddle two lower-level season tickets said: ""The last thing my son and I want to see is Michael Vick in an Eagles jersey. We made up our mind to sell the tickets ... $3000 cash gets the tickets. Any info feel free to ask, serious buyers only, I want the deal done fast."" Lower-level season tickets were selling on an unrelated auction site for as much as $10,000 a pair. Bob Jenkins of northeast Philadelphia predicted most Eagles fans -- known to be some of the nation's most demanding -- won't be badmouthing the decision. ""The only people who won't be quiet are the people who don't like the Eagles,"" Jenkins told philly.com. ""Of course, they're going to be talking because he's going to be throwing some touchdowns."" Despite Jenkins' assumption, it's unclear what role Vick will play on the team. A gifted athlete known more for his dazzling runs than his pinpoint throws, Vick's last season in 2006 was a bit of a disappointment to Atlanta fans. The Falcons finished 7-9, and Vick had a completion percentage of 52.6. He also threw for 2,474 yards, more than 1,000 fewer yards than the Patriots' Tom Brady, who completed 62 percent of his passes, and almost 2,000 yards behind the Colts' Peyton Manning, who completed 65 percent of his tosses. However, Vick also ran for 1,039 yards, the most ever by a quarterback. Mike Giunta of Tabernacle, New Jersey, told CNN affiliate WPVI-TV in Philadelphia that signing Vick would spawn ""dissension"" among the Eagles, who made it to their conference championship last season, losing to the Arizona Cardinals. Giunta  predicted the move would create consternation between Vick and five-time Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb. ""McNabb's going to be looking over his shoulder constantly now,"" Giunta said. McNabb said in a Thursday news conference that he welcomed the addition of Vick and he ""pretty much lobbied to get him here because everybody deserves a second chance."" Several Eagles fans concur. One of them, Leroy Emerson of north Philadelphia, told philly.com, ""That was the best move the Eagles ever made, one of the best."" Some fans, however, were licking their wounds and pointing to the most severe dogfighting allegations leveled against Vick: that he hanged dogs from trees, electrocuted and drowned them. The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have both skewered Vick. The latter alluded to Vick being a ""psychopath"" earlier this year and released a statement Friday saying, ""Millions of decent football fans around the world are disappointed"" in the Eagles. ""PETA certainly hopes that Vick has learned his lesson and feels truly remorseful for his crimes -- but since he's given no public indication that that's the case, only time will tell,"" the statement said. Upon being conditionally reinstated to the NFL last month, Vick acknowledged making ""terrible mistakes"" and said he had used the past two years to re-evaluate his life. The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick also offered to work with the organization on its anti-dogfighting campaign. To some Eagles fans, though, the nature of Vick's crimes is too much to forgive. ""I'm just a little upset with it because I'm such an animal lover,"" Susan Wilson of Pitman, New Jersey, told WPVI. Kelley Williams of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, told the station that she, too, had trouble accepting Vick's signing. ""I think he should be out of the NFL altogether,"" she said. Sports talk shows already are predicting that Vick can redeem himself only by making big plays, and at least some of the Philadelphia faithful concur he can shut up his critics on the field. ""If they keep him,"" fan James told philly.com, ""he'll be the man.""",0.5444709,5688
62,"NHA TRANG, Vietnam  -- Editor's note: Football fans Daniel and Clinton Rowling were in Vietnam late December when the country won a major tournament for the first time. The event sparked wild celebrations in the South East Asian nation but joy soon turned to carnage as five people died and dozens were injured in the celebrations. They share their story. Celebration time: Five people were killed on Vietnamese roads as football joy got out of control. After spending a month in Vietnam we can safely say that the Vietnamese are passionate about three things: Ho Chi Minh, or Uncle Ho as the locals call him; football; and the tourist dollar. Everywhere you look you see football. The locals proudly sport imitation merchandise of their favorite European team anywhere and everywhere they can. Other than on your person, the next best place to show your allegiance is on your motorbike through stickers. Some local football teams even play in the strips of their favorite club. While we were in Vietnam the ASEAN cup was contested. It is the premier football contest in South East Asia. Every second year the countries of the region do battle for the crown. Up until 2008, the only winners of the cup had been Singapore and Thailand with three titles each (Indonesia has been the bridesmaid three times). After pool play, the best of two finals series was played out between Thailand and Vietnam. Thanks to the close proximity, and some historical conflict, there is a strong rivalry between these two countries. The Thais played host to the Vietnamese in the first leg, where the visiting underdogs were winners, stunning the home crowd by winning the match 2-1. The reverse leg was played in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. After unexpectedly winning the first final, local interest was even higher than normal. We watched the game in the coastal city of Nha Trang. The locals flocked to their TV sets and the beer flowed freely. Each TV was like a magnet for thirsty football fans. Do you have a great football tale to tell? Send us your story and you could be featured on Football Fanzone! We quickly realized there was a pecking order and that the most hardcore fans had the best seats, whilst the ""fair weather supporters"" were relegated to the back benches. As foreigners we were at the very bottom of the pecking order. We were resigned to watching the match from the street kerb on small plastic seats half in the rain which refused to dampen the crowds' spirits. Predictably Thailand took the lead and were up 1-0 (making it 2-2 on aggregate) and time was ticking away. Vietnam's tactic of playing breakaway ""Kung fu"" style football was looking largely ineffective against the more structured, controlled and dominant Thai approach. Still, the Vietnamese were doing enough to create the odd opportunity to gives the locals hope. Still tied up on aggregate, and with the end of regular time looming, the Vietnamese were awarded a free kick. The unexpected happened. The kick came in and a Vietnamese player managed to find it with the crown of his head sending the ball to the back of the net and the locals through the roof. Everyone jumped to their feet, there were hugs, high fives and toasts. As outsiders we sat stunned and could only watch the spectacle unfolding. With the game effectively over, the victors were overcome with emotion whilst the fans were overcome with energy. The locals were eager to include us in celebrations, with the nominated English speaker communicating with us in his limited vocabulary. We replied with our full Vietnamese vocabulary of smiles, nods and numerous thumbs up. The older men who had been doing the majority of the drinking were content  sitting and enjoying each other's company, while the younger and more boisterous sections of the crowd had their own form of celebration and they swiftly brought the streets alive with a massive motorcycle posse. Led by the rider with the biggest Vietnamese flag, they proceeded to lap the town honking their horns and generally getting excited. With the roads slick from a weeks worth of rain and the drivers impaired from a cocktail of excitement and alcohol, we wisely watched from the sidelines. After finding out that dozens of people were injured and there were even a few deaths -- it seems we made a good choice to keep out of it. But while we did watch on, we were left wondering: How do the passengers stay on the bikes when they jump up and down? How can anyone see where they are going with all the flags? And, where were the traffic police? We're offering a reward to anyone that can tell us what the Vietnamese supported before cable television brought top flight football to the masses. Whatever it was, we suspect it died a very quick death.",0.5421727,3401
63,"(CNN) -- An overcompetitive parent gets into an argument with a stubborn coach because he thinks his child isn't getting enough playing time -- it's a familiar scene on youth sports fields across America. One critic of the Rhode Island plan said giving parents a outlet for petty complaints ""opens up a can of worms."" Now, a Rhode Island senator wants the state to step in and create a formal outlet for the ""concerns and objections"" some parents have. Democratic Sen. John Tassoni Jr. introduced a bill that would create a youth sports oversight council on the state level. The council would act as mediator in disputes between parents of youth athletes and sports officials. In answer to critics, Tassoni said Friday that the notion the bill would mean ""big brother"" could begin to oversee youth sports is a misconception. The bill cites the need for a third party to step in at times, stating that ""parents lack a proper outlet to share concerns and objections about youth sports."" But the parents are the biggest problem, said Matt Rodrigues, general manager and owner of Teamworks youth sports program in Warwick, Rhode Island. ""They are crazy, especially in Rhode Island. The kids on the court are scared because the parents are yelling and screaming,"" Rodrigues said. But the answer, he said, is not to create a council that ""makes decisions we can deal with ourselves."" A similar council exists in Waterford, Connecticut -- run by the town, not the state. ""It kind of surprises me that [Rhode Island would] do it on such a large level like that,"" said Bruce Miller, president of the Waterford Youth Sports Council. Waterford's council is made up of representatives from the town's 11 sports leagues. Tassoni's bill states that at least four of the members of the state council would be regional youth sports representatives. He said the council is needed because right now there is no place to go to resolve disputes. ""There's no place right now to bring a case forward and have a third party take a look at it,"" he said. Under the bill, Republican Gov. Donald Carcieri would appoint seven volunteers -- approved by the state Senate and House -- to sit on a panel called the Rhode Island Youth Sports Oversight Council. Tassoni said the seven-member council wouldn't be made up of politicians, but  ex-coaches, ex-officials and ex-athletic directors. Some adults involved in youth sports aren't happy about it. One blogger posted concerns on the Web site of a Rhode Island newspaper, the Providence Journal. ""Hey Tassoni: What do you do, [lie] in bed and think to yourself -- 'what haven't me and my cronies either screwed up, bankrupted or embarrassed yet? Hmmmm ... haven't touched Little League yet.' Do me a favor -- and I ask this as a coach and a parent -- stay the hell away from my field!!!!"" wrote the blogger. Others think the government should ""concentrate on the state."" Rodrigues of the Teamworks program said giving parents a place to do petty complaining only ""opens up a can of worms."" He said the council just ""sounds like another way to take power away from our programs -- they have enough [power]."" The governor has not taken a position on the legislation and will not until he reviews the bill, press secretary Amy Kempe said Friday. She added, however, that ""there appears to be some vague language and constitutional issues."" The bill states that the volunteers on the council would be expected to ""provide oversight and mediation"" to youth sports programs in the state, as well as develop and adopt a process to review and address complaints. In addition, the council would have the authority to establish and collect fines. But the bill does not go into detail about how to implement the reviewing and fining processes. The bill, with some revisions, is scheduled to be heard by the state Senate on Wednesday. Tassoni hopes to have the council in place by June or July.",0.54183865,3568
64,"(CNN) -- Abe Pollin, the longtime owner of the Washington Wizards professional basketball franchise, has died, the Wizards said Tuesday. He was 85. No further details were immediately available. The Wizards said information would be released as it became available. The Pollin family asked that their privacy be respected, the basketball team said. Pollin and his wife, Irene, have owned the NBA franchise, previously known as the Washington Bullets and before that the Baltimore Bullets, for 45 years. As the majority owners of Washington Sports & Entertainment Limited Partnership, the Pollins oversaw the Washington Wizards, Washington/Baltimore Ticketmaster and in-house promoter Musicentre Productions, as well as the management of the Verizon Center and George Mason University's Patriot Center, according to the Verizon Center's Web site. Pollin at one time also owned the Washington Capitals hockey team and the Washington Mystics WNBA team. Pollin moved from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the Washington area when he was 8, according to the Verizon Center's biography of him. He attended George Washington University and worked for his family's construction company for more than a decade, it says. He and Irene, a St. Louis, Missouri, native, launched their own construction company in 1957 and built several large apartment houses and office buildings. They have two sons and two granddaughters, according to the Web site.",0.5405165,8525
65,"(CNN) -- The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves. Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship. Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves. In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later. When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, ""It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either."" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body. And from the steroids, he said. Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers. Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: ""Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster."" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview . Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. ""Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,"" McMahon said. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business. His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- ""Raw"" and ""Friday Night Smackdown"" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. ""If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,"" he said. He also said there isn't ""any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free.""  Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong » . The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons. David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning. But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. ""It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,"" he said. ""And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart."" Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life. Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a ""baseline"" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for ""nonmedical"" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared. ""It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,"" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years.  Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being ""straight edge"" » .

66,"(CNN) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins have won the Stanley Cup for a third time after a pair of second-period goals by Max Talbot gave them a narrow 2-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings in the deciding game of the best-of-seven series. The Penguins celebrate with the Stanley Cup after claiming a narrow game seven victory at Detroit. Talbot opened the scoring early in the second period and added a second on a two-on-one break midway through the session to help the Penguins to avenge their defeat to the Red Wings in last year's finals. Jonathan Ericsson pulled a goal back for the home side with just over six minutes remaining in the game but Detroit were unable to prevent Pittsburgh from becoming the first team in 38 years to claim the Stanley Cup with a game seven victory on the road. The Penguins, who last won the title in 1992, were depriving the Red Wings of becoming the first team since Detriot themselves (in 1998) to retain the Stanley Cup. ""We're going to enjoy this one. We're going to sit back and relish the moment. We're going to get our names on the Cup, and we'll get our day with it,"" Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma told their official Web site. The result proved a difficult pill to swallow for Red Wings winger Marian Hossa. Last summer, the Slovakian turned down a lucrative long-term contract with the Penguins, thought to be worth in the region of $50 million, to sign a one-year $7.5m deal with Detroit -- thinking they had a better chance of hoisting the Stanley Cup.

67,"(CNN) -- Nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia, Michael Vick was reinstated to the National Football League on a conditional basis, according to an NFL statement Monday. Michael Vick will be considered for full reinstatement based on his progress by the sixth week. Vick ""will be considered for full reinstatement and to play in regular-season games by Week 6 based on the progress he makes in his transition plan,"" the statement said. Week 6 of the NFL season is in October. Vick may participate in practices, workouts and meetings and may play in his club's final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement, the league said. Vick, in a statement, thanked the league's commissioner and former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy, who has served as his mentor. ""I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Commissioner [Roger] Goodell for allowing me to be readmitted to the National Football League,"" Vick said in a statement. ""I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege, not a right, and I am truly thankful for the opportunity I have been given."" Vick, 29, was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20 and returned to his home to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. Vick also said in his statement that he is re-evaluating his life after the ""terrible mistakes"" he made. ""As you can imagine, the last two years have given me time to re-evaluate my life, mature as an individual and fully understand the terrible mistakes I made in the past and what type of life I must lead moving forward,"" Vick said in the statement. ""Again, I would like to thank the commissioner for the chance to return to the game I love and the opportunity to become an example of positive change."" The former Atlanta Falcons player is a free agent and has not been signed by any team. Goodell said he was not involved in any negotiations between Vick and a team. Dungy has agreed to continue working with Vick as an adviser and mentor, the NFL statement said. Goodell said Vick underwent tests after requests from animal rights groups, including a psychiatric evaluation. ""We worked with animal rights activist groups, and we are clear,"" he said. ""We worked with their medical professionals about the aspects of our evaluations. Michael fully cooperated with all of those tests. Those tests did not indicate there was any reason he couldn't make a transition forward."" In a letter to Vick, Goodell wrote that his decision regarding full reinstatement ""will be based on reports from outside professionals, your probation officer and others charged with supervising your activities, the quality of your work outside football"" as well as factors such as the absence of any further law enforcement issues. iReport.com: Should Vick get a second chance? ""This step-by-step approach is not meant to be a further punishment and should not be viewed as such,"" Goodell wrote, according to the NFL. ""Instead, it is intended to maximize the prospect that you can successfully resume your career and your life. I believe that a transitional approach with a strong network of support will give you the best opportunity to manage effectively the various issues and pressures that you will inevitably face in the coming weeks and months and earn your full reinstatement.""  Watch Goodell talk about his decision » . The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after his guilty plea. Although he was released from federal custody July 20, he must serve three years of probation, the league said. In reviewing Vick's status, Goodell considered court records, submissions from Vick and others, reports from outside professionals and conversations with current and former players, among other items. At a hearing July 22, Goodell spoke to Vick along with his representatives and others, including NFL Players' Association officials. ""As I emphasized to you when we met ... it is actions that count,"" Goodell wrote to Vick. ""I accept that you are sincere when you say that you want to, and will, turn your life around and that you intend to be a positive role model for others. I am prepared to offer you that opportunity. Whether you succeed is entirely in your hands."" Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At a hearing in that case, he told the judge that he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison. ""We take this as a very serious matter,"" Goodell said. ""We're dealing with a young man's life."" He said Vick admitted lying to him about his involvement in dogfighting and apologized. Goodell said he accepts Vick's apology. He acknowledged that he does not like being lied to but said he intends to move forward. The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick has offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns. Wayne Pacelle, the organization's president, has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist young people who have been involved. In testimony before the bankruptcy judge, Vick acknowledged committing a ""heinous"" act and said he should have acted more maturely. ""Your margin of error is extremely limited,"" Goodell wrote to Vick. ""I urge you to take full advantage of the resources available to support you and to dedicate yourself to rebuilding your life and your career. If you do this, the NFL will support you.""",0.5202993,6298
68,"(CNN) -- Terrell Owens, a former San Francisco 49er and a former Philadelphia Eagle, is now a former Dallas Cowboy. The Cowboys released Owens late Wednesday, according to published reports. The Dallas Cowboys have decided to part ways with wide receiver Terrell Owens, according to published reports. Questions surrounding the future of the controversial wide receiver have swirled since the Cowboys' season ended with a 44-6 loss at Philadelphia that kept Dallas out of the playoffs. Owner Jerry Jones had said in recent weeks that he had not decided whether to keep or release Owens. In early February, Jones struck down an ESPN report that Jones' son, Stephen, who is the team's vice president, was lobbying his father to cut the wide receiver. Owens signed a three-year, $25 million contract with Dallas in March 2006.  He signed a new four-year, $34 million deal that included a $12 million signing bonus, in June 2008. Owens finished the 2008 season 69 receptions for 1,052 yards and 10 touchdowns. In Owens' three seasons with the team, the Cowboys went 31-17, but 0-2 in the playoffs. While Owens has produced solid numbers on the field, his career has been plagued with controversy. After Owens left the San Francisco 49ers in 2003, he insinuated in an interview with Playboy magazine that his then-quarterback, Jeff Garcia, was homosexual. As a Philadelphia Eagle, Owens made headlines for coming back to play in Super Bowl XXX after suffering a severely sprained ankle and a fractured fibula weeks earlier. The following season, he voiced his displeasure with QB Donovan McNabb and Eagles management, which led to a four-game suspension without pay and his eventual deactivitation from the team. In September 2006, police responded to Owens' home after his publicist found the wide receiver unresponsive with an empty bottle of painkillers. Owens refuted reports that it was a suicide attempt and claimed a combination of painkillers and supplements made him groggy. This past season, Owens was reportedly jealous of Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo's relationship with tight end Jason Witten. According to published reports, Owens believed Romo and Witten held private meetings and created plays without including him. Published reports also said Owens had issues with Cowboys offensive coordinator Jason Garrett's play-calling. -- CNN.com's Kamal Wallace contributed to this report.",0.51713926,3642
69,"PHOENIX, Arizona  -- New England's failure to protect star quarterback Tom Brady proved the decisive factor as the Patriots flunked their chance of a perfect 19-0 season and Super Bowl glory. Brady is sacked by defensive end Michael Strahan in the third guarter of the Super Bowl. Brady has weaved his magic behind an all but impregnable offensive line all season but not on Sunday as he was sacked five times in the 17-14 defeat to the New York Giants. ""They have some great pressure schemes, obviously some great pass rushers,"" Brady said. ""Once we kind of got the idea of what we were doing, I thought we handled it much better, but we didn't get the ball in the end zone enough."" Coming in, Brady had been sacked a career-low 24 times this season playing behind a line that produced three Pro Bowlers in Koppen, left tackle Matt Light and left guard Logan Mankins. Throw in right guard Stephen Neal and right tackle Nick Kaczur, and Brady played most of his record-breaking season not having to worry much about getting hit by bloodthirsty defenders. ""I like when I don't get touched,"" Brady said earlier in the week. Then, disaster struck -- in the form of an all-out, pressure-packed swarming defensive attack by the Giants -- in the worst possible setting. It was the first time Brady had been sacked as many as five times since the New York Jets did it on Sept. 21, 2003. New England had no answer for the Giants' bulldozing defense. ""If I could tell you, we'd have it fixed,"" running back Kevin Faulk said. ""At the same time, they outplayed us."" They sure did, and left Brady wondering what hit him. Brady simply had no time to find Randy Moss and his other targets on a regular basis against the Giants. With 19 seconds left in the game and the Patriots facing a do-or-die scenario, Brady was sacked for the final time when Jay Alford pulled him down at New England's 16-yard line. Brady was left with nothing to do but try two straight desperation heaves to Moss to no avail. ""I think their intensity from the beginning snap to the end of the game was really higher than ours,"" Moss said. ""We just couldn't meet that intensity."" With help from their linemen, the Patriots set NFL records for points scored and total touchdowns, while Brady broke the league mark for TD passes and Moss set the record for scoring receptions. That high-powered offense was held to a season-low 14 points in the Super Bowl -- mostly because it couldn't get time. ""They played well defensively,"" coach Bill Belichick said. ""They've been able to rush. They led the league in sacks, they rushed all year. They are a good defensive football team. They played well."" ""We all could've done things better tonight,"" Brady said. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2008 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

71,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's time this debate was settled once and for all. Football or soccer? What do you think the round-ball game should be called? While it may be a basic discussion; arguing whether the beautiful game should be called ""football"" or ""soccer"" is one of the most fundamental debates of the code. On the face it, the answer should be simple. The world body -- FIFA -- has the word ""football"" in its title. End of story? Not quite. The term soccer was coined as slang for ""association,"" in England in the 1880s. The Oxford University Association Football Club's Web site explains that former England captain Charles Wreford-Brown is commonly credited with its origin. Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football (""rugger"") and ""association"" football. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, the word soccer is a British term, not an American one. Soccer is more commonly used in countries that play other forms of football, i.e. Americans also play gridiron football and Australians who play ""Aussie Rules"" football -- a completely different sport entirely. Soccer was initially referred to as football in the United States. In 1913 the United States of America Football Association was formed. In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation. Meanwhile they now have the Football Federation of Australia, it's hard to imagine a change to the national side's ""Socceroos"" nickname anytime soon. The ""Footyroos"" doesn't quite have the same sound to it. Now, you may be sitting back in Britain reading this and wondering why there should be any debate at all about the name of football? If you are thinking that, just remember one of the most popular shows in Britain is called ""Soccer Saturday"", so it's not as clear cut as you may think! Even the sport's governing body seems to be open to both options. At next year's FIFA World Cup in South Africa, the area where fans will gather during the tournament is to be called ""Soccer City"". Maybe the word ""football"" just doesn't work? We'd like you to tell us whether the game should be called football or soccer and why. Let us know in the SoundOff box below. You can also vote in the quick vote on the Football Fanzone homepage. Or, if you really want to make your case -- why not post us a video or photos at the Football Fanzone page on iReport.com.

72,"(CNN) -- Some people might call 17-year-old Joshua Hanson one the luckiest people on the planet. Others might call him crazy. I-Reporter Joshua Hanson offered a look at the Mark IV helmet from his ""Legendary Limited Edition Halo 3."" Hanson waited more than eight hours outside a Woodbury, Minnesota, video game store on Monday evening to be the first in his town to buy one of the most anticipated video games in history -- ""Halo 3.""  Watch Hanson buying the game amid cheers » . The final chapter in Microsoft's acclaimed video game series hit shelves at the stroke of midnight Monday in similar stores across the nation. The Xbox 360 game is expected to shatter entertainment sales records within its first 24 hours of release. Hanson is not alone in his loyalty to the game, and his belief in ""Halo's"" power to entertain and inspire. We asked other CNN.com readers for their take on ""Halo 3."" Some offered comparisons to ""Star Wars"" and ""Harry Potter,"" while others discussed compelling new graphics and features. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Curt Otto of Springfield, Virginia I waited in line for two-and-half hours to get this game at midnight. I purchased the Legendary Edition of this game at a hefty $130! Totally worth it! Although I haven't slept since yesterday and I'm currently at work and very tired, I would do it all over again for ""Halo."" This is the GREATEST game ever crafted by the hand of man. If you own a 360, buy this game. If you don't own a 360, buy one and go buy this game! The single player is incredible and the online multiplayer is MIND BLOWING! Totally worth $130!!! Tony Nash of Buffalo, New York  I've been playing ""Halo"" since the very first game came out in 2001. After getting the brand new Box with a copy of ""Halo"" and throwing myself into the game, I quickly realized this wasn't a standard gaming experience. It was something much, much more. The game had a great attitude and unique art style. Along with great audio and environments that brought the worlds to life. It also had the most addictive, natural, and fun game play I've ever experienced. It also contained a well written, downright intriguing story. Getting together with friends to play the multiplayer portion of the game only cemented this title's epic status. Then came November 2004, when, of course, a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of ""Halo 2."" It is no joke; ""Halo"" is more than just a game. Now, I plan on ""finishing the fight"" as soon as I leave work. I had ""Halo 3"" pre-ordered for about a month before it came out. Hey, after all, it's good to keep the kid inside you alive and well! Cody Chmelik of Clearwater, Florida  ""Halo 3"" is the most anticipated event since the trial of O.J., but the only difference is that ""Halo"" isn't disappointing. ""Halo 3"" was the best game I have ever played. The levels are choreographed perfectly, the players look real and the game play is phenomenal. I recommend this game to players of all ages. Wayne S. of Colorado Springs, Colorado  ""Halo"" is not just a game, it's a lifestyle, a booming culture of millions of Xbox fans who eat, sleep and live ""Halo."" ""Halo"" has jumped started the major league gaming industry and will continue to do so with ""Halo 3."" I will be getting my copy of ""Halo 3"" at midnight and plan on playing it for days straight. I have played the beta and let me tell you: This is the best video game of the year by far and will be played by the masses for years to come just like ""Halo 2."" Brian Baker of Beatrice, Nebraska I am 30 years old, and for my 30th birthday my wife pre-ordered ""Halo 3"" for me as a birthday present. The 6 month wait for the present/game didn't bother me one bit. The story that is ""Halo"" is something that people can easily identify with. The late '70s to late '90s had Luke Skywalker and the alpha-male heroes of ""Star Wars."" The Generation X, Y and Z now have an alpha-male hero of their own in the Master Chief that they can relate to, or use to associate different attitudes and help instill values of patriotism. In this case, patriotism is not for just a country, but an entire planet and species. I am a very patriotic person, a veteran and a father and see the values that may hide below the surface in this Trilogy, which is why I'm a ""Halo"" fan. Jarrod Leda of Tarentum, Pennsylvania  Despite the hype, I am very excited for this [new game]. Some question why ""Halo"" got so big, as there are other good shooters very similar to it. I think, like ""Star Wars"" before it, it just got things right. And now, it's become iconic: the characters, the universe, it's something everyone who loves games can talk about and share. The game allows things that most other games would not; the physics and mechanics of the engine are great. And it plays flawlessly on X-box live. I can't wait. Vivek Patel of Albany, New York  ""Halo"" can be compared to ""Harry Potter"" in that when you start reading or playing you have to finish. The third installment gamers will wait in line for hours; even bleed to finally finish the fight that was started years ago. To me ""Halo 3"" isn't even advertised that much, and they will achieve their records by sheer popularity. Alessandro Miglio of Walnut Creek, California  The ""Halo"" franchise is like a budding ""Star Trek"" phenomenon. There are a lot of hardcore fans, like myself, who are not just really into the games, but read all the books and comics that expand the universe. We even write tons of theories and fan fictions with all the potential created by the ""Haloverse."" I consider myself a ""Trekkie"" of ""Halo,"" loud and proud. E-mail to a friend .",0.4084319,460
73,"(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix ""Mc"" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. ""We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,"" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. ""We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's."" The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. ""We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,"" Suppiah said. ""We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food."" The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix ""Mc"" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the ""Mc"" in McCurry stands for ""Malaysian Chicken Curry."" A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. ""We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,"" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: ""Tasty and so Gooood.""",0.3997389,6132
