0,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In 1994, universal health care was a key policy plan for then-President Bill Clinton. It eventually failed. In 1993, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary  Clinton listen to a man's story about health care problems. Now, 15 years later, another Democratic president is taking on the challenge, but facing an uphill battle from not only from Republicans, but from members of his own party. Will failing to reform health care have the same consequences for Obama's administration as it did for Clinton's? Like Obama, Clinton came into office with reforming the nation's health care system as one of his top priorities. Then-first lady Hillary Clinton, who headed the administration's task force on reforming the system, delivered a 1,000-page plan that was dubbed ""Hillary Care,"" which required Americans and permanent resident aliens to enroll in a health plan. Other provisions included Americans below a certain income level paying nothing for care. Republicans decried the plan as overcomplicated and used it to tag the administration as big government-loving, tax-and-spend liberals. The plan's failure emboldened Republicans and led to huge Democratic losses in the 1994 midterm elections, allowing the GOP to take control of Congress and stymie other Clinton initiatives. Now, 15 years later, Obama potentially faces a similar fate. Obama seeks the overhaul to ensure that health insurance is available to the 46 million Americans currently without coverage while preventing costs to both the government and individuals from continuing to climb.  Watch more on the health care debate » . The president had set a deadline for passage of a bill before the August congressional recess, but in an interview Monday with PBS's Jim Lehrer, the president said that if Congress tells him it's ""going to spill over by a few days or a week,"" that's fine. iReport.com: Weigh in on the health care debate . A senior White House official adds that while there is a ""long way to go"" in coming up with legislation, there is a true effort being made to devise a bipartisan plan.  See how the plans compare » . ""[The Senate] is working in a bipartisan way and despite all of the cacophony of attacks you've heard from some Republicans, I think you've got to give some credit to the Republicans on the finance committee who are making right now a good faith effort, despite pressure, probably from their own party, to work with Democrats to try to come up with something that people can get behind,"" said White House Communications Director Anita Dunn on Wednesday. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, says in order for health care reform to get passed, it will take a well-coordinated bipartisan effort. ""I think the president is right. He really does want a bipartisan effort. And that's what it's going to take for it to be for the American people. But the approach to it is kind of like a doctor practicing bad medicine where you fix only symptoms and don't treat the disease. ... the disease is only going to get worse."" But the battle over health care reform is weighed down by complex problems, competing interests, a $1 trillion price tag, conservative Democrats in sticker shock and Republicans sensing an opportunity to regain some of the power they lost in the 2006 congressional elections. Conservative Bill Kristol wrote in his blog that there is an opportunity to inflict political damage to the president and that opponents shouldn't compromise: . ""My advice, for what it's worth: Resist the temptation,"" Kristol wrote. ""This is no time to pull punches. Go for the kill."" The White House has so far resisted another idea for raising revenue -- creating a tax on the medical benefits provided by employers. Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said he likes the idea, but Obama said it could be too disruptive to a system in which 180 million Americans have health coverage provided by their employers. But while Obama has remained mostly popular in national polls so far, support for his health care plan has begun to wane. A CNN Poll of Polls released Wednesday indicates that less than half the country approves of how he's handling the issue. Forty-seven percent in the poll approve of how the president is dealing with health care reform, with 44 percent disapproving. The poll averaged the three most recent national surveys that asked about Obama's performance on health care: USA Today/Gallup (July 17-19); ABC/Washington Post (July 15-18) and CBS News (July 9-12). Meanwhile, Coburn -- a fierce opponent of the current plans being worked up in Congress -- says that Congress needs to slow down. ""Getting this right is better than meeting a political deadline ... I want him to back off the timeline,"" he said. ""Let's start over ... let's fix it all and do it in a way that the American people won't charge it to their grandkids."" CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who has worked under several administrations, including Clinton's, says there's is concern that Obama may be trying to ram health care legislation through Congress as he did with the economic stimulus plan. ""And they [Americans] don't have a lot of confidence in the past effort in the stimulus plan to put together something comprehensive and -- 'here we go again' ... something that looks like it's being thrown together to many people in the public. So they're not confident that they want it. And Coburn's argument -- along with nearly all congressional Republicans' -- could pose a risk to Obama's political capital with Americans. Gergen agrees. ""I think he's got two other problems: One is that he doesn't have a firm plan to sell. ... Second thing is, from his point of view, there are many in the public that'd like to hear from him and also like to see just how he's negotiating the plan,"" he said. ""What they look for is a leadership that says, 'Here's where we're going to go,' not a leadership that says, 'I'm urging Congress to make more progress' "" Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who Obama had tapped to be Health and Human Services director and the point person on health care reform before tax problems derailed his nomination, said getting health care reform passed now will be a major factor in defining Obama's presidency. ""Because he's made it such an issue, and because he has invested so much personal time and effort, this will, more than stimulus and more than anything he has done so far, be a measure of his clout and of his success early on,"" Daschle was quoted in the New York Times. ""And because it is early on, it will define his subsequent years."" CNN's Dana Bash, Paul Steinhauser and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",0.90673304,7751
2,"Washington (CNN) -- The push to overhaul health care received a major boost Thursday as the American Medical Association and AARP endorsed legislation drafted by top House Democrats. The AARP, the nation's largest organization of older Americans, is a nonpartisan group that advocates for people 50 and older. The AMA, historically an opponent of health care reform, is considered one the nation's most influential doctors' advocacy groups. ""I want to thank both organizations again for their support, and I urge Congress to listen to AARP, listen to the AMA and pass this reform for hundreds of millions of Americans who will benefit from it,"" President Obama said at the White House. The backing of those two groups comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, oversees final changes to the $1.1 trillion health care bill. The measure likely will come to a final vote Saturday. Read the House health care bill (PDF) A 42-page manager's amendment on the health care legislation posted Tuesday night made mostly technical changes in the nearly 2,000-page bill compiled from three Democratic proposals passed by three House committees. By making the changes public Tuesday, House Democratic leaders could open floor debate on the bill Friday, while fulfilling their pledge to allow 72 hours of review before bringing the measure to the full chamber. Pelosi insisted Thursday she will have the 218 votes necessary to pass the bill. Meanwhile, President Obama is set to huddle Saturday with congressional Democrats on Capitol Hill to review the legislation. Check out the key parts of the bill . In a statement, AARP CEO Barry Rand said, ""We started this debate more than two years ago with the twin goals of making coverage affordable to our younger members and protecting Medicare for seniors. ""We can say with confidence that [the House bill] meets those goals with improved benefits for people in Medicare and needed health insurance market reforms to help ensure every American can purchase affordable health coverage."" The AMA's president, Dr. J. James Rohack, told reporters Thursday that the legislation is ""not a perfect representation of our views"" but is close enough to warrant his group's support and keep the reform process moving forward. Rohack said the bill needs to be accompanied by legislation reversing scheduled Medicare reimbursement payment reductions to physicians. Responding to the AMA endorsement, Obama said the doctors' group is ""supporting reform because [its members have] seen firsthand what's broken about our health care system,"" Obama said. ""They would not be supporting it if they really believed that it would lead to government bureaucrats making decisions that are best left to doctors."" Watch Obama say health care reform is moving forward . Meanwhile, House Republicans on Thursday continued to signal their opposition to the measure. GOP leaders held a rally on Capitol Hill along with ""Tea Party"" movement protesters and other activists to warn that the House legislation would translate into a full-blown government takeover of the health care system. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Thursday that Democrats had forgotten the lessons of August's town hall meetings when angry conservatives criticized health care legislation. ""I think what we're going to see is the town hall coming to Washington, D.C., just to remind members of Congress [that] we're the ones we would like you to pay attention to, not lobbyists. And we don't want the government to own our health care,"" Bachmann said. Speaking at Thursday's opposition rally, actor John Ratzenberger, who played Cliff on the sitcom ""Cheers,"" slammed the Democratic bill as a form of socialism. ""These are Woodstock Democrats,"" Ratzenberger said. ""We have to remember where their philosophy comes. It doesn't come from America. It comes from overseas. It comes from socialism. And socialism is a philosophy of failure."" House Democrats have rejected an alternative $60 billion Republican plan as inadequate for meeting the goals of expanding health coverage to most of the nation's 46 million uninsured while bringing down costs and ending controversial industry practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Pelosi's bill would extend insurance coverage to 36 million uncovered Americans and guarantee that 96 percent of Americans have coverage, according to the Democratic leadership. The claim is based on an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Among other things, the bill would subsidize insurance for poorer Americans and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to purchase coverage. It also would cap annual out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Pelosi's office has said the bill would cut the federal deficit by roughly $30 billion over the next decade. The measure is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and spending constraints in Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, individuals with annual incomes more than $500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge. Growth in Medicare expenditures would be cut by 1.3 percent annually. The House bill also includes a government-run public option. Under the House plan, health care providers would be allowed to negotiate reimbursement rates with the federal government. Pelosi and other liberal Democrats had argued for a more ""robust"" public option that would tie reimbursement rates for providers and hospitals to Medicare rates plus a 5 percent increase. Several Democrats representing rural areas, however, killed the proposal after complaining that doctors and hospitals in their districts would be shortchanged under such a formula. One thorny issue yet to be resolved among House Democrats is the bill's final language on abortion. Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, has been pushing leaders to add stronger language prohibiting the use of federal money to pay for abortions under the health care overhaul. Stupak has vowed that if he isn't allowed a vote on the issue, a group of 40 anti-abortion Democrats will work to block the bill from getting to the House floor. The House bill differs from legislation the Senate is considering in a number of critical ways. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also favors a public option but would allow individual states to opt out of the plan. An $829 billion bill recently passed by the Senate Finance Committee does not include a tax surcharge on the wealthy but would impose a new tax on high-end health care policies, which critics have dubbed ""Cadillac"" plans. A large number of House Democrats are opposed to taxing those policies, arguing that such a move would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous benefits. Individuals under the $829 billion Finance Committee plan would be required to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $750. The House bill imposes a more stringent fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. The Finance Committee bill would require large companies to contribute to the health care costs of lower income workers if those workers received a government subsidy for insurance. The House legislation would require larger companies to provide employee insurance for everyone or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of total revenue. Democratic leaders in both chambers agree on establishing nonprofit health care cooperatives and stripping insurance companies of an anti-trust exemption that has been in place since the end of World War II. Reid refused earlier this week to predict when the chamber would pass a health care bill, possibly signaling difficulty in generating support from his entire Democratic caucus.

3,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A woman asked Rep. Allen Boyd at a town hall meeting the other day if health care reform proposals would force people to let the government access their bank accounts. False rumors about health care have been aired at town hall meetings, like this one in Maryland last week. ""That's not true,"" the Florida Democrat responded. ""When someone sends you something on the Internet that sounds crazy, how about just checking it a little bit?"" The CNN Truth Squad, which fact-checks political claims, has debunked the bank-access rumor as false. Yet that claim, and others that have been disproved, keep coming up in the national debate on health care reform, inflaming an already emotional issue. Heated protests have disrupted town hall meetings nationwide, with people shouting at legislators and venting anger at President Obama. While the anger is genuine, some of it is based on misunderstandings of the actual proposals, said Kenneth Thorpe, a health policy expert at Emory University. ""People are freaked out because there's a lot of bad information and misinformation being ... put out there by opponents of health care reform,"" Thorpe told CNN. Obama and the Democrats say misleading information sows fear and anger, particularly among senior citizens who are worried about how changes in health care could affect Medicare. The White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have set up Web campaigns to refute what they describe as provably false information. ""It is now evident that an ugly campaign is under way not merely to misrepresent the health insurance reform legislation, but to disrupt public meetings and prevent members of Congress and constituents from conducting a civil dialogue,"" Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote in a recent commentary. Republican opponents respond that the emotional reaction is due to Democratic efforts to rush through legislation that amounts to a government takeover of the health care system. They say the proposals eventually will lead to a system that rations treatment based on an individual's ability to contribute to society. ""We've actually started a national debate about exactly what is at stake here,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Wednesday. Speaking on MSNBC, Steele said the town hall meetings across the country are reflecting that debate. However, when asked directly about one of the most controversial statements by some Republicans -- that a House bill would create ""death panels"" to decide who gets treatment -- Steele refused to acknowledge that such language was misinformation. The CNN Truth Squad determined the ""death panel"" claim was false, along with others spread by conservative commentators and activist groups who say Democratic proposals would promote euthanizing elderly Americans and mandate free health insurance for illegal immigrants. One of the most disputed provisions, contained in a House health care proposal, would pay doctors for consultations with patients on end-of-life issues, such as living wills. The proposal is similar to one originally written by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia. Opponents have implied or said outright that consultations would be required -- even though the proposal says they would be voluntary. Some Republicans and Democrats have rejected the ""death panel"" language, but the issue keeps coming up. At a town hall meeting Tuesday night in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, powerful House Democrat Rep. Barney Frank called the notion that health care legislation required killing elderly people ""the single stupidest thing I've heard."" Obama says the misinformation confuses people over an already complex issue that requires public understanding. ""The notion that somehow I ran for public office or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma ... when you start making arguments like that, it's simply dishonest,"" the president recently said. Wendell Potter, a former insurance company communications executive, told CNN that the insurance industry deliberately spreads false information with the goal of disrupting the debate. The insurance industry hires public relations firms that create front groups to try to ""destroy health care reform by using terms like 'government takeover of the health care system' or we are heading down a 'slippery slope toward socialism' or 'we're going to kill your grandpa' because of these health care regulations,"" said Potter, now a senior fellow at the Center for Media and Democracy, which calls itself a nonpartisan watchdog group on public relations spin. Asked to respond to Potter's accusation, the director of strategic communications at America's Health Insurance Plans, Robert Zirkelbach, acknowledged in an e-mail Wednesday that the group opposes some aspects of Democratic health care proposals. ""We have been very clear and up front since day one about our opposition to a government-run insurance plan that would dismantle employer coverage, bankrupt hospitals, and increase the federal deficit,"" Zirkelbach's e-mail said. He denied that employees of his group, which is the national association of health insurers, were ""responsible for disruptive and inappropriate tactics at health care town hall meetings."" However, some of the language cited by Potter is used by politicians, including Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who told the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that ""the Democrats want a government plan, where the government will take over health care."" Democratic proposals call for creating a government-funded health insurance plan for people who otherwise lack coverage. That is the so-called public option, which they say would compete with private insurers. Hatch and other Republicans argue the public option would create a subsidized competitor that would drive private insurers out of business, leading to the government taking over the health care system. Though Democrats deny that Republican assertion, it touches on broader fears among conservatives. Many conservatives consider the proposed health care overhaul an irresponsible and dangerous expansion of the federal government. They liken it to socialist-style control over private issues, at a cost of nearly $1 trillion over 10 years. At the same time, Americans facing an economic recession and costly government responses -- such as the $787 billion economic stimulus package and billions more paid to bail out the financial services and auto industries -- are fearful of further change and additional federal debt. Such concerns come up repeatedly at the town hall meetings held by Democrats and Republicans. The deficit recently topped $1 trillion for the first time; Obama has said he hopes to cut it in half by the end of his first term. ""When the economy is hurting, people are more inclined, I think, to be skeptical, nervous,"" Frank said. The misinformation, while refuted, has brought changes in the debate. Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh exulted Monday when Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said that Senate negotiators dropped the end-of-life consultation provision from their proposal because Grassley said he worried it ""could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly."" Limbaugh said on his radio show that no matter what the health care proposals say, they will result in less money available for health care. ""It will forever transform the relationship between Americans,"" he said. ""We will instantly become rivals. We're going to become competitors vying against each other for precious health care dollars."" Grassley, who is one of three Republicans negotiating a possible bipartisan health care agreement, has used controversial language himself. He told a town hall meeting last week he couldn't support a provision that would ""pull the plug on grandma."" Former Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle called such comments part of the problem. ""It's hyperbolic, it's fear-mongering, it's actually politics at its worst,"" Daschle said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""That's the kind of thing that generates the kind of anger and fear and anxiety that people have today.""",0.8997439,6586
4,"(CNN) -- Health care reform should mean all Americans can get coverage while allowing doctors to heal patients instead of being bureaucrats, President Obama told the American Medical Association on Monday. The AMA agrees with Obama on the need for health care reform but not how to go about it. In a speech to the 158th annual meeting of the doctors' advocacy organization, Obama called an overhaul of the ailing health care system the most important issue for the nation's long-term economic stability. He acknowledged the concerns of doctors that reforms could bring a government-heavy system that would dictate how patients get treated and how much physicians get paid. But he called such thinking wrong. Obama urged all players -- doctors, patients, insurance companies, drug companies and the government -- to contribute to a workable system that would provide coverage for the 46 million uninsured Americans while reducing costs and increasing efficiency. ""You did not enter this profession to be bean-counters and paper-pushers,"" Obama said to a standing ovation at the conference in Chicago, Illinois. ""You entered this profession to be healers, and that's what our health care system should let you be."" Obama has made health care reform a top priority of his young administration, and Congress will consider at least three proposals in coming weeks to address an issue that deeply divides Democrats and Republicans.  Watch Sen. John McCain discuss health care reform » . The AMA represents a powerful constituency of U.S. physicians, and its support is considered important in getting a bill through Congress. Dr. J. James Rohack, president-elect of the AMA, welcomed Obama's speech for acknowledging the challenges facing doctors, including excessive bureaucracy, the threat of malpractice lawsuits and medical students' debt burdens. The president's 50-minute speech detailed the problems of the U.S. health care system and presented his plans for confronting them. He blamed some of the spiraling costs on a reimbursement system that he said pays for the number of tests and services provided, regardless of what is needed. ""It is a model that rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care; that pushes you, the doctor, to see more and more patients even if you can't spend much time with each; and gives you every incentive to order that extra MRI or EKG, even if it's not truly necessary,"" Obama said. ""It is a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession -- a calling -- to a business."" He also cited unnecessary tests and procedures as part of a ""defensive"" medicine culture created in part by the risk of medical malpractice lawsuits. To loud applause, he said ending unnecessary procedures could require restrictions on malpractice liability to protect doctors. ""I'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards, which I personally believe can be unfair to people who've been wrongfully harmed, but I do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first, how to let doctors focus on practicing medicine, how to encourage broader use of evidence-based guidelines,"" Obama said.  Watch the Health and Human Services chief talk about the administration's plan » . Rohack called for a ""safe harbor"" for doctors to determine treatment, warning that ""unless we have protection in a courtroom for not ordering a test, we're going to order that additional test."" Obama's speech advocated an end to health care insurance providers denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, with an emotional reference to his mother's battle against cancer amid concerns of whether her treatment would be covered. ""Changing the current approach to pre-existing conditions is the least we can do -- for my mother and every other mother, father, son and daughter who has suffered under this practice, who've been paying premiums and don't get care,"" he said to another ovation. Any health care bill must include measures to modernize record-keeping with an electronic system that reduces paperwork and increases efficiency, and to emphasize preventive treatment to reduce overall illness and chronic conditions that sap the health care system, Obama said. He defended his call for a government-funded health insurance option for people who are uninsured or cannot afford full coverage. Obama repeated a promise that reforms will not require anyone to change from existing coverage but said an overhaul should include mandates for individuals to obtain coverage or employers to provide it. A proposal from Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, a longtime health care reform proponent, includes a public option as one choice for consumers. Republican leaders adamantly oppose any public option, complaining it would lead to an eventual government takeover of health care similar to the cradle-to-grave coverage in Canada and England. Kennedy's health-care bill would cost $1 trillion over a decade and reduce the number of uninsured by about 16 million, according to a preliminary analysis released Monday on the the unfinished bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which examined the unfinished bill with the the help of the Joint Committee on Taxation, said that the health-care bill would cost about $1 trillion over fiscal years 2010 to 2019. The AMA acknowledges the need for reforms but opposes any public option plan that forces physicians to participate, expands the fiscally challenged Medicare program for senior citizens or pays Medicare rates. Obama outlined a series of steps to lower current costs and raise taxes to pay for an overhaul of the health care system. His actions would realize almost $1 billion over the next 10 years in cost reductions, new revenue and other funding, which is roughly the amount that health care reforms would cost, the president said. His plan includes reducing tax deductions for high-income Americans. Another funding idea under consideration is taxing the medical benefits of employer-provided health coverage, which the Obama administration opposes but has not ruled out entirely.  Watch more about who pays for health care » . A national survey released last week by Diageo/Hotline found that 68 percent of those questioned opposed taxing health insurance benefits to provide funding for the enormous cost of expanding health care coverage to all Americans. Possible alternatives to a public health insurance option include private cooperatives, like electricity cooperatives, owned and paid for by communities that would compete with existing insurance programs. Supporters say such a program would require initial government support, but eventually would provide the kind of competition Obama seeks without creating a new government bureaucracy.  Watch Rep. Ron Paul weigh in on health care reform » . Obama said Monday that the nation is ready to overhaul the health care system after decades of debate with no substantive action. ""What makes this moment different is that this time -- for the first time -- key stakeholders are aligning not against, but in favor of reform,"" he said. ""They are coming together out of a recognition that while reform will take everyone in our health care community doing their part, ultimately, everyone will benefit."" As Obama spoke to doctors in Chicago, Senate Republican leaders in Washington intensified their attacks on the proposals, with one predicting ""momentum will inevitably slow"" as Americans learn the details of the complicated overhaul. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, also said it's ""fairly unlikely"" Republicans will back a Finance Committee bill that has been seen as the most likely measure in Congress to gain bipartisan support. In speeches and press events on Capitol Hill, Republican leaders highlighted controversial aspects of the proposals that have drawn criticism from key doctor and hospital groups. ""Over the weekend, the administration proposed making cuts to Medicare as a way of deferring costs of a new government plan. That is exactly the wrong approach,"" Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said in speech on the Senate floor. ""America's seniors expect Congress to stabilize Medicare so it continues to serve their needs, not drain its resources to pay for another even bigger government plan."" Kyl said Obama's proposals would lead to higher taxes, rationing of health care and too much government control of a sector that needs vibrant private sector involvement to thrive. Kyl and McConnell introduced a bill Monday that would prevent the government from using comparative medical analysis to ration health care. The stepped-up criticism came days before two Senate committees begin the process of formally passing their bills. While GOP support for the Obama reforms has never been strong, Democrats have been negotiating with Republicans for months in hopes of bringing some on board.

5,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A key Senate negotiator said Sunday that President Obama should drop his push for a government-funded public health insurance option because the Senate will never pass it. President Obama at a town hall meeting earlier this week pushing his health care reform plan. Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota said it was futile to continue to ""chase that rabbit"" due to the lack of 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster. ""The fact of the matter is there are not the votes in the United States Senate for a public option. There never have been,"" Conrad said on ""Fox News Sunday."" His comment signaled a shift in the health care debate, with Obama and senior advisers softening their support for a public option by saying final form of the legislation is less important than the principle of affordable coverage available to all. At a town hall meeting Saturday in Colorado, Obama said the public option is just one of many issues critical to successfully overhauling the ailing health care system. ""All I'm saying is ... that the public option, whether we have it or we don't have it, is not the entirety of health care reform. This is just one sliver of it,"" the president said. Asked Sunday if Obama would accept a bill lacking a public option, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president insists on more competition in the health insurance marketplace to offer consumers better choices. ""The bottom line ... is: Do individuals looking for health insurance in the private market have choice and competition?"" Gibbs said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""If we have that, the president will be satisfied."" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius echoed Gibbs, telling CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that a final health care bill will include competitive choices for consumers in one form or another. ""There will be a competitor to private insurers,"" she said. ""You don't turn over the whole new marketplace to private insurance companies and trust them to do the right thing. We need some choices and we need some competition."" Opponents of overhauling the health care system argue the Democratic proposals under consideration by Congress go too far and will lead to a government takeover of the health care system. ""We have the best health care system in the world,"" Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We need to expand it. We do not need to destroy it."" At issue is how to provide coverage for an estimated 46 million uninsured people while reversing a climb in health care costs. Democratic proposals passed so far by House and Senate committees include a public insurance option, mandates for people to be insured and employers to provide coverage, and an end to insurance companies refusing to cover pre-existing conditions. Most Republicans oppose the public option and requirements for employers to provide coverage. They also call for limits on medical malpractice lawsuits -- something Democrats generally don't favor. However, the two parties generally agree on a number of provisions contained in the Democratic bills, including increased efficiency in Medicare and Medicaid and focusing on preventive health programs. Conrad is one of six Senate Finance Committee members -- three Democrats and three Republicans -- who are negotiating a compromise health care bill that would be the only bipartisan proposal so far. Instead of a public option, the negotiators are considering a plan proposed by Conrad to create nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that could negotiate coverage as a collective for their members. Conrad said such cooperatives would provide the competition sought by Obama and Democratic leaders to force private insurers to hold down costs and improve practices. The government would put up initial funding to provide required reserves but would have no other role, he said. ""It's not a public plan at all in terms of government running it,"" Conrad said. Shelby called the cooperative idea a ""step in the right direction"" and ""a far cry"" from other proposals, adding that Obama and Democratic leaders have ""read the tea leaves"" from town hall meetings around the country. However, Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas told CNN it would be ""very, very difficult"" to support a bill that lacked a public health insurance option. ""Without the public option, we'll have the same number of people uninsured,"" Johnson said in a ""State of the Union"" interview. ""If the insurance companies wanted to insure these people now, they'd be insured."" She added that ""an option that would give the private insurance companies a little competition"" is ""the only way"" to be sure that insurance is available to low-income people and people without employer-provided coverage. Meanwhile, leaders of organizations representing America's doctors and senior citizens defended the proposed health care overhaul that their groups had opposed in past years. Dr. J. James Rohack, president of the American Medical Association, and John Rother of AARP -- formerly the American Association of Retired Persons -- told ""Fox News Sunday"" a comprehensive overhaul sought by Democrats was necessary. ""There are some moving parts that if you just do one and don't do the other, you're going to have unintended consequences,"" said Rohack, head of the nation's largest doctors' advocacy group. Rother, executive vice president of policy and strategy for the largest senior citizens' advocacy group, said properly addressing excessive health care costs and waste requires addressing both health insurance coverage and how health care treatment is delivered. Both men rejected accusations that a health care overhaul would bring rationing of health treatment based on bureaucratic measures such as cost and economic productivity of patients. ""There's a myth that rationing doesn't occur right now,"" Rohack said, noting that some companies currently deny coverage for pregnancy as a pre-existing condition. ""That's why this bill is so important,"" Rohack said. ""It gets rid of rationing happening right now"" and leaves decisions to patients and doctors. Rohack also condemned claims by some Republicans that a provision in one House bill would lead to so-called ""death panels"" encouraging euthanasia of senior citizens. ""That's absolutely wrong, it's a falsehood,"" he said, adding that the provision was intended to provide government support for consultations between patients and their doctors. Spreading of the ""death panel"" rumor by some conservative commentators and some Republican politicians prompted emotional opposition at town hall meetings across the country. Senate negotiators on a compromise bill say they have dropped the provision from their proposal due to potential misinterpretation of the intent.",0.8910427,7261
6,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The struggle over health care reform intensified Thursday as President Obama sought to build on what administration officials hoped was new momentum generated by his prime-time address to Congress. In his address to Congress on Wednesday, President Obama pushed for the government to help the uninsured. Republican leaders ripped the president's Wednesday night speech, arguing that he had botched a unique opportunity to build bipartisan consensus and offer specifics on his long-awaited plan. ""Now is the time to act,"" Obama told an audience near the White House. ""We have talked this issue to death. ... The time for talk is winding down. The time for bickering is past."" The president was joined by representatives of the American Nurses Association, which has strongly endorsed the passage of a healthcare bill incorporating the president's ideas. Obama repeated several reform principles outlined in his Wednesday night address, including the need for all Americans to have access to coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions. He again insisted that his plan will provide ""more security and stability to those who have insurance,"" extend it to those who don't and slow the rate of growth in health care costs. He reiterated his call to cap out-of-pocket costs and create a health insurance exchange in which individuals and small businesses can pool resources to help bargain for lower coverage costs. iReport.com: ""Obama's speech lacked courage"" Obama has also pushed for the federal government to provide greater financial assistance to those who can't afford insurance. The president's latest call for reform came as the Census Bureau released new data showing that the number of people without health insurance rose from 45.7 million in 2007 to 46.3 million in 2008. All Americans would be required by law to have health insurance under Obama's proposal, which the administration has projected to cost $900 billion over 10 years. The requirement, Obama noted Wednesday night, would be similar to mandatory auto insurance in most states. Businesses would also be required to either offer health care coverage to workers or contribute to covering their costs of obtaining coverage.  CNN's political analysts respond to Obama's speech » . Top congressional Republicans declared Thursday that they remain staunchly opposed to Obama's plan. They also accused the president of delivering an intensely partisan speech to Congress that unfairly maligned opponents and distorted basic facts. ""I thought the speech was partisan, uninformative, disingenuous and not likely to encourage those who have honest disagreements with him to be able to work toward some kind of common solution,"" said Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Arizona. Kyl complained that Obama had made it tougher to reach common ground by constantly referring to opponents' ""unyielding ideological"" arguments and ""bogus claims."" ""Nobody can have a disagreement with him based upon a valid difference of opinion,"" Kyl said. ""It's always the other -- the motive of the other individual is a bogus motive."" Among other things, Kyl disputed Obama's claims that the Democratic plan won't add to the federal deficit. ""He wasn't referring to either the House or Senate bill that have gone through committee, because [the Congressional Budget Office] has projected that both of them have a deficit,"" he said. ""So somehow there's going to be a different bill, which is going to solve that deficit problem, I gather, but we didn't hear any detail about that."" Health care legislation has cleared three committees in the House of Representatives, as well as the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. It is currently under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee. Kyl also took issue with Obama's claim that people will have the option of keeping their current coverage if they like it. ""It's not true under the bills. Even if you like your insurance, there's a good chance you won't be able to keep it,"" Kyl claimed. Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided over the question of whether to allow for a government-run public health insurance option. The president continued to stress his preference for such an option Thursday, saying it would force private insurers to lower costs. But he has repeatedly referred to the provision as only one alternative for increasing competition for health insurance and signaled his openness to ideas. Republicans are unanimous in opposing a public option, calling it an unfair competitor that would drive private insurers from the market and lead to a government takeover of health insurance. Obama has rejected that claim as a false allegation intended to scare people. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong supporter of the public option, insisted Thursday that such a provision would save ""tens of billions of dollars"" in health-care expenses. But the speaker, who has insisted that a health care bill cannot pass the House without a public option, also indicated that she doesn't consider the provision ""non-negotiable."" At a separate news conference, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, argued that if a nonprofit health care cooperative successfully expands competition and ""makes the insurance companies honest ... that would fill the bill."" The speaker nevertheless skewered the Republican opposition for failing to provide what she claimed was a reasonable alternative. Opponent of reform ""hit us with their best shot"" during the August congressional recess, she said, and their attacks amounted to little more than ""distortion"" and ""misrepresentation."" Pelosi also criticized Rep. Joe Wilson, the South Carolina Republican who heckled Obama on Wednesday night by shouting ""You lie!"" when the president denied that health care legislation would provide free coverage for illegal immigrants. The ""episode was unfortunate,"" and Wilson's remarks were ""stunning to hear,"" Pelosi said. But given Wilson's subsequent apology, she said, ""it's time to move on."" Both Democrats and Republicans have criticized Wilson for what they called a show of disrespect toward the president. Shortly after the speech ended, Wilson issued a statement that apologized for his ""inappropriate and regrettable"" comments. Obama said Thursday that he accepted Wilson's apology. ""I'm a big believer that we all make mistakes,"" the president noted during a Cabinet meeting. But it's important to have a debate ""without vitriol. ... Our goals are generally the same whether we're Democrats or Republicans."" Wilson insisted that his outburst was ""spontaneous"" and agreed with the White House that the health care debate merits ""a civil discussion."" One top Republican, however, also opined that Wilson's outburst reflected the strong passion being generated by the health care debate. ""We ought to have civil discourse in America, but don't underestimate the amount of emotion that people are feeling,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner said.",0.8887625,6135
7,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama called Thursday for high-level talks with Republicans to work out a compromise on health care legislation, then putting the resulting bill to a vote in Congress. ""If Congress decides we're not going to do it, even after all the facts are laid out, after all the options are clear, then the American people can make a judgment as to whether this Congress has done the right thing for them or not,"" Obama said. ""That's how democracy works."" Obama's comments were the first clear signal from the White House or Democrats in Congress on how they would proceed on a top legislative priority after losing their 60-seat super-majority in the Senate. Republican Scott Brown was sworn in as the new U.S. senator from Massachusetts earlier Thursday, leaving the Democrats one vote shy of being able to overcome GOP filibusters of health care reform and other major initiatives. Asked at a party fund-raising event about the Democratic strategy for health care reform going forward, Obama said Democratic leaders in the House and Senate were working out differences in the separate health care bills passed by each chamber last year. Once that was finished, Obama said, the next step would be ""to call on our Republican friends to present their ideas."" ""What I'd like to do is to have a meeting whereby I'm sitting with the Republicans, sitting with the Democrats, sitting with health care experts, and let's just go through these bills -- their ideas, our ideas -- and walk through them and in a methodical way so that the American people can see and compare,"" Obama said. ""And then I think we've got to go ahead and move forward on a vote,"" he added. ""We've got to move forward on a vote."" A White House official acknowledged later Thursday that this was new language from Obama to offer a possible scenario for health care talks to move forward. However, the official stressed it was ""not a new strategy"" for the White House to coalesce behind, and aides were still mulling various options to complete action on health care legislation. Democrat leaders in Congress have struggled to come up with a consensus strategy since the party lost its super-majority in the Senate. Republicans have unanimously opposed the health care bills so far, meaning Democrats would be unable to pass a bill through the Senate because of a certain GOP filibuster. Brown, now the 41st Republican senator to give the GOP its unstoppable filibuster ability, said Thursday after his swearing-in that Congress should start over on the health care issue instead of continuing to work on existing proposals. Republicans complain the comprehensive Democratic health care bills would lead to a government takeover of health care. They call for smaller steps focused on individual issues, such as limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. Democrats, however, say that spiraling health care costs that threaten the nation's future economic stability can only be addressed through comprehensive reform. Obama said Thursday the Democratic bill that will emerge from the House-Senate talks on joining their two proposals would expand coverage to at least 30 million Americans who lack health insurance while reducing long-term health care costs. The measure would include an insurance exchange to allow people and small business owners to pool together to purchase coverage, Obama said, but he made no mention of a government-run public health insurance option that Republicans have rallied against. Obama said the Democratic bill would include reforms that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions or capping lifetime benefits. ""And by the way, all of it is paid for,"" Obama said. ""Not only is it deficit-neutral, but the Congressional Budget Office, which is the bipartisan office that is the scorekeeper for much things cost in Congress, says it is going to reduce the costs by $1 trillion."" Obama called health care reform the ""single best way to bring down our deficits,"" adding ""nobody has disputed that."" ""Nobody can dispute the fact that if we don't tackle surging health care costs, then we can't control our budget,"" he said. While Democrats from both chambers have been working together to merge their two bills, alternative strategies also have been discussed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week that the chamber would vote next week on one provision of its health care bill, which would drop the current anti-trust exemption for the insurance industry that allows practices such as market allocation. The Senate bill would maintain the anti-trust exemption, so it was unclear whether the House's limited first step would win approval there. However, Democratic aides have said that House Democrats want to keep momentum on health care going in coming weeks. CNN's Ed Henry contributed to this story.",0.88150454,9886
8,"BELGRADE, Montana (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday took his push for a health care overhaul to traditionally conservative Montana, saying a bill to extend coverage to the uninsured while helping those already with coverage will pass this year. President Obama discusses his health care plans Friday at a meeting in Belgrade, Montana. However, an influential Democratic representative said the House would only pass a health care bill in January or later, signaling continuing rifts within Obama's party on his domestic priority for 2009. ""We're taking some time to make sure it's done right,"" said Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania. ""I don't know that we'll get something done before January, and even then we may not get it done. We're going to do it right when it's finally done."" Obama told a largely supportive Montana audience at his second of three town hall meetings this week that fixing the health care system requires improving health insurance practices and reducing the costs of treatment. He sought questions from skeptics of his proposed health care overhaul, seeking to confront some misconceptions fueled by opponents Democrats say are undermining the debate. One man who identified himself as a proud National Rifle Association supporter and believer in the Constitution asked how the government would pay to expand health insurance coverage to 46 million uninsured people. ""You can't tell us how you're going to pay for this,"" said the questioner, Randy Rathie, a welder from Ekalaka, Montana. ""The only way you're going to get the money is to raise our taxes. That's the only way you can do that."" Obama responded with his oft-repeated explanation that two-thirds of the cost of overhauling health care -- estimated at about $900 billion over 10 years -- would come from eliminating waste and improving efficiency in the current system, which includes the government-run Medicare and Medicaid programs for the elderly and impoverished. The rest would have to come from new revenue, he agreed with the questioner, and he called for reducing the amount of deductions that people making more than $250,000 a year can make on their income taxes. ""If we did that alone, just that change alone ... that would raise enough to pay for health care reform,"" Obama said, noting that would meet his election campaign pledge to avoid any tax increase on people earning less than $250,000 a year. However, Obama said some taxes would have to be raised, and the crowd applauded when he said he believes people with more money, like himself, ought to pay a heavier burden. ""We've got to get over this notion that we can have something for nothing,"" Obama said. ""That's how we got into this deficit and this debt in the first place."" In reference to emotional and heated debate at some other town hall meetings across the country in recent weeks, Obama told Rathie, ""I appreciate your question, the respectful way you asked it, and by the way, I also believe in the Constitution."" Afterward, Rathie said he was impressed by Obama's performance but remained skeptical. ""I don't think he knows where that money's going to come from,"" he said. ""If he does, he's not saying."" Obama noted there is more work to be done, with Congress seeking to merge at least four bills, along with a possible compromise agreement being negotiated by Democratic Sen. Max Baucus and five other members of his Senate Finance Committee, into a single bill in September. Another questioner chosen when Obama asked for a skeptic identified himself as an insurance provider who wanted to know why Obama and Democrats are vilifying the insurance industry in the health care debate. Earlier in the meeting, Obama described what he called discriminatory practices by insurance companies that dropped coverage of people who became sick or refused to cover those with pre-existing medical conditions. Obama noted some insurance companies are contributing to the reform debate, but said others are spending millions of dollars to try to defeat any health care legislation. For a health care overhaul to work for everyone, he said, it has to ensure all Americans are covered so that insurance companies have incentive to participate. They won't be able to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions or ""cherry pick"" healthy people while refusing coverage for sick people, Obama said, so increasing the total numbers covered will be the enticement. On Saturday, Obama will hold another town hall meeting in Grand Junction, Colorado, before vacationing in some national parks with his family next week. In addition, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama will hold ""some events not yet announced"" in coming days. While Obama has said consensus can be reached on health care reform, contentious town hall meetings held by lawmakers around the country have created a different impression. The White House, and many Democrats in Congress, hope that by building support in the West, the president can start to turn the tide. Though the region is largely Republican, Obama made some inroads in the latest election. He won in Colorado and lost by just a slim margin in Montana. However, Murtha's comments in Bentleyville, Pennsylvania, to CNN affiliate WJPA signaled continuing divisions among House Democrats over the scope and pace of health care legislation. ""We said to the speaker [House Speaker Nancy Pelosi], the leadership, let's not rush this thing,"" Murtha said. ""Let's do it right, so we'll have a uniquely American plan, if the thing passes."" Obama's town hall events are just part of a larger Democratic strategy for winning support in the region. The Democratic National Committee began a TV ad this week promoting the president's health care plan. A committee spokesman said the ad will run on national cable as well as on local cable in New Hampshire, Montana, Colorado and the District of Columbia. The group Families USA, which supports the president's plan, also launched a campaign Thursday that includes an ad running in a dozen states -- among them Montana and Colorado. But groups opposed to the president's plan have their own campaigns. One voter in Livingston, Montana, not far from where the president spoke in Belgrade, summarized the kinds of concerns that she and many others in the region have. ""I believe that there is a health care crisis, I really do,"" Sonja McDonald, who voted for Obama in 2008, told CNN's Ed Henry on Thursday. ""Do I believe that the government needs to be more involved? No!"" Henry met McDonald at a clinic that gets half its funding from taxpayers. ""The government being involved is fine,"" McDonald said. ""It's just ... when they try and overstep, when they try to say, 'No, this is what needs to be done.' """,0.8813609,6338
9,"(CNN) -- President Obama on Monday strongly praised a decision by the nation's pharmaceutical industry to agree to a deal cutting drug costs for elderly Americans, calling it an example of the kind of compromise required for successful national health care reform. President Obama says the pharmaceutical industry announcement ""marks a major step forward."" The agreement discounts medications for Medicare beneficiaries facing high out-of-pocket expenses when their benefits reach a gap in coverage. ""This is a significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform, one that will make the difference in the lives of many older Americans,"" Obama said at the White House. ""Today marks a major step forward, but it will only be meaningful if we complete the journey. ... I have to repeat and revive an old saying we had from the campaign: Yes, we can. We are going to get this done."" The nation's top drug manufacturers agreed over the weekend to at least a 50 percent discount for most beneficiaries for brand-name medicines purchased in the so-called ""doughnut hole"" gap in coverage, Obama noted. The gap involves medication costs of senior citizens between roughly $2,700 and $6,100 a year that are not covered by the Medicare part D plan. The deal will be part of an $80 billion reduction in Medicare drug costs for senior citizens over the next 10 years, according to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Montana, who helped negotiate the agreement. Part of that $80 billion will go to closing the Medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole."" Congressional staffers did not have precise estimates, but Finance Committee spokesman Erin Shields said they expect the $80 billion commitment to both cover the Medicare drug gap and leave additional money for other, still unannounced, programs. The American Association of Retired People, the nation's largest organization of senior citizens, has praised the pharmaceutical industry agreement as a step toward health care reform. Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs noted Monday that AARP was opposed to health care reform during the first term of former President Bill Clinton in the early 1990s. ""You've got the pharmaceutical industry and the largest group representing seniors in this country, who 16 years ago weren't at the table but were on the other side of the political debate,"" Gibbs said of groups expressing support Monday for health care reform. ""I think that represents progress and important steps towards real reform."" Overhauling health care is a top priority of Obama's administration, but the initial proposals to reach Congress last week received a rocky reception. The Congressional Budget Office determined that either of two similar bills written by Senate Democrats would cost more than $1 trillion, which was higher than expected. Republican opponents immediately slammed the measures, and the Senate Finance Committee delayed scheduled hearings on one of the bills. Hearings by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on the other measure began amid intense partisan bickering, with hundreds of amendments proposed by Republican opponents. At least two more bills are expected from the House of Representatives, and a bipartisan group led by former Senate majority leaders Tom Daschle, Howard Baker and Bob Dole also has offered guidelines for a proposal. At issue is how best to reduce the cost and increase the reach of the current health care system, which officials say is increasingly draining personal, corporate and government budgets while leaving 46 million Americans without health insurance. Obama has warned that a failure to act soon will bring far worse economic difficulties than the costs of plans under discussion. Both parties in Congress agree on the need to slow the increase in health care costs while ensuring that all Americans can get health insurance, but they differ sharply on how to proceed. Democrats generally favor a government-funded ""public option"" to compete with private insurers. Republicans have said such a step would lead to a government takeover of health care, which they oppose. Republicans also accuse Obama and Democrats of trying to rush through what they say is flawed legislation in 2009 before the politics of midterm elections in 2010 and the 2012 presidential race. The parties do appear to agree on several broad principles, however, including an emphasis on preventive care, cost-cutting measures in the existing Medicare and Medicaid programs, and a halt to denials of coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions.

10,"(CNN) -- President Obama is expected to sign the final health care legislation into law this week, but while the action wraps up on Capitol Hill, the heated debate over reform shows no sign of cooling down. With lawmakers back in their districts for the spring work period, the conversation just moves to a different platform. For Democrats, the two-week recess is an opportunity to highlight the immediate benefits of a law the public is not yet sold on. Democrats say the health care law provides all Americans with the opportunity to receive health care and prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to those who need it most. For Republicans, it's a chance to rally support behind their efforts to repeal what they decry as a ""takeover"" of the health care system that will saddle future generations of Americans with debt. What's the one thing you want to ask your representatives? Republicans have made ""repeal and replace"" their battle cry, and Obama has said he welcomes the fight. At an event in Iowa City, Iowa, last week, the president scoffed at the Republicans' strategy, saying, ""My attitude is -- Go for it."" Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann last week introduced a bill to repeal the health care legislation, as did other Republican lawmakers. ""We need to work together, whether we're Republicans, independents, Democrats, we all have to work together for whatever is in the best interest of the American people. And repeal most certainly is in the best interest of the people because this bill will lead to economic harm if it's left in place,"" Bachmann told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" But Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he doesn't think efforts to knock down the legislation stand much chance. ""They may want to push forward on a repeal of health care, to tell small businesses you're not going to get tax credits to pay for insurance, to tell families you now can't keep children on your policy until [they]'re 26, to tell folks that you're now subject to these abuses of the insurance industry. I think they'd be unwise to do it. I think the American public will reject it,"" he told CBS. Despite the opposing messages, both sides say the public supports them. Republicans say the public opposes the president's plan, but Democrats insist that people will eventually accept the plan now that it is finalized. And so far, both sides have a point. Most Americans disapprove of the health care reform law, but that does not translate into majority support for the ""repeal and replace"" strategy, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Monday. CNN Poll: Americans divided over repealing health care law . Meanwhile, polls from both CBS and Quinnipiac University suggest that there has been a slight uptick in approval of the legislation following the vote. Another survey, a ABC/Washington Post poll released Sunday, indicated that the public's overall view of the health care plan has held steady, with 46 percent supporting it and 50 percent opposed. The percentage of people who said they strongly support the health care legislation, however, increased by 10 points since February, while the percentage who strongly opposed it stayed about the same. ""We'll find out in November who won or lost this battle,"" Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, told CBS. ""What I do next is, I'm trying to replace those who voted for this bill. I want to repeal it. And I want to replace it with some real reform that puts patients in charge of their health care again,"" he said. Echoing DeMint, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was looking forward to an election in November ""about whether this health care bill is a real fix or a phony political document trying to grow the government."" Calling the legislation a ""giant Ponzi scheme,"" the Republican senator vowed that the fight ""won't wind up just being in Washington."" Following a week of over-the-top rhetoric stemming from the health care vote, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland, cautioned that if lawmakers don't watch their own words, they'll hurt their credibility. ""If we don't take ourselves seriously and act in a serious way, we're not going to be taken seriously by the American people,"" Mikulski said. ""I have a suggestion. Let's go back to the three R's: respect, rules of engagement that promote decorum, and, No. 3 -- stop the rewards system that enables you to raise a lot of money after using outrageous and bizarre behavior,"" she added.",0.8761048,9477
11,"Washington (CNN) -- Health care reform backers won a key victory Saturday night as the Senate voted to move ahead with a floor debate on a sweeping $848 billion bill. The 60-39 vote to prevent a Republican filibuster against the start of debate on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's legislation broke down along strict party lines. All 58 Senate Democrats -- along with independent Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- supported bringing the measure to the floor. Thirty-nine of the 40 Senate Republicans opposed the motion. Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, didn't vote. ""Tonight's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses, reining in spiraling health care costs, providing stability and security to those with health insurance and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement. The polarized vote set the table for a holiday season now virtually certain to be marked by acrimonious deliberations on President Obama's top domestic priority. Top Senate Democrats, who are trying to pass a bill before the end of the year, spent much of the day tarring their Republican colleagues as defenders of a broken status quo benefitting rich insurance companies at the expense of ordinary American families. Republicans, in turn, slammed Democrats for pushing a bill that conservatives insist will force millions of Americans to drop insurance plans they like while boosting premiums, raising taxes and leading to government rationing of care. Read the health care bill (PDF) ""Today we [decide] whether to even discuss one of the greatest issues of our generation,"" Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said shortly before the vote. ""Whether this nation will finally guarantee its people the right to live free from fear of illness and death, which can be prevented by decent health care for all."" The Republicans ""are frightening people,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ""Now is not the time to go wobbly in the knees. Now is the time to stand strong ... and move this country forward."" ""This bill... is a massive monument to bureaucracy and spending,"" replied Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. It ""imposes punishing taxes on almost everyone. ... A vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote in favor of adding to the tax burden of the American people in the midst of double digit unemployment."" The bill ""does worse than nothing,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. It ""threatens the economic recovery. ... Changes to the health care system must be responsible and not break the backs of the taxpayers."" The procedural vote represented another milestone in what has become an epic battle over the future of America's health care system. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a more than $1 trillion bill this month. If the Senate also manages to pass a bill, a congressional conference committee will then need to merge the House and Senate proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to Obama's desk to be signed into law. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that Reid's 2,074-page bill would extend health insurance coverage to 31 million additional Americans. The agency estimates that the proposal would reduce the federal deficit by $130 billion over the next 10 years, through 2019. Any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be ""subject to substantial uncertainty,"" but probably would result in ""small reductions in federal budget deficits,"" according to budget office analysts. A minimum of 60 votes is required to break a filibuster in the 100-member Senate. The outcome of the Senate vote was unclear before Saturday afternoon, when Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Arkansas, announced her intention to back a floor debate on the measure. Lincoln, a key moderate probably facing a tough re-election campaign in 2010, said the issue deserved further debate and consideration. She made clear, however, that she opposes several aspects of Reid's bill, including a controversial government-run public option. ""Although I don't agree with everything in this bill, I believe it is important to begin debate,"" Lincoln said. ""The issue is very complex. There is no easy fix."" Republicans wasted no time tearing into Lincoln's vote, issuing a news release while she was still announcing her decision, proclaiming that she had caved to ""pressure from the left wing of her party."" ""There's no doubt that this vote will be a critical issue for Sen. Lincoln as she embarks on her uphill re-election bid,"" said Amber Wilkerson Marchand, a GOP spokeswoman. ""The people of Arkansas will have an opportunity to hold her accountable when they cast their ballots next November."" Two other Democratic moderates whose support was considered to be in doubt -- Nebraska's Ben Nelson and Louisiana's Mary Landrieu -- also announced their decision to back a full debate shortly before the vote. Reid's bill, projected to ensure coverage for 94 percent of Americans, includes a range of tax increases and new fees. The Medicare payroll tax on individuals earning $200,000 a year and couples earning $250,000 a year would increase by half a percentage point, from the current 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent. In addition, insurers providing costly health coverage -- known as Cadillac plans -- would face a 40 percent tax on policies worth more than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. The bill also includes a 5 percent tax on the cost of elective cosmetic surgery, as well as new fees for insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The total projected revenue raised by all the taxes and fees would exceed $200 billion. The bill would require individuals to buy health insurance, with a fine for non-compliance of $95 in the first year that would escalate to $750 by 2016. Unlike the plan recently passed by the House, the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care. Businesses with more than 50 workers, where at least one employee qualifies for government subsidies, would face a penalty of $750 for every full-time employee if it does not offer health care coverage. Reid's bill also would expand government-run Medicaid coverage for the poor to everyone making less than 133 percent of the national poverty level. Democratic leaders in both chambers have been wrestling with the most contentious issues, including abortion and immigration, as well as how to pay for reform. The House bill has more restrictive abortion language and includes a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals making more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million. Both bills include a government-run public option, but the Senate version allows states to opt out before the national program would go into effect in 2014. The two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes, including creating health insurance exchanges, expanding Medicaid, subsidizing insurance for low- and some middle-income families, and capping out-of-pocket medical expenses while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers under both plans would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history.",0.8708502,6973
12,"Editor's note: Rep. Charles Boustany is a Republican who represents southwest Louisiana. Before being elected to Congress, Boustany practiced medicine as a cardiothoracic surgeon for 14 years. Rep. Charles Boustany says Democrats' health care plans don't focus on quality. (CNN) -- Americans deserve the best health care system in the world -- one that emphasizes quality, but reduces cost, so all Americans can participate. As a doctor, I saw firsthand the problems many patients face finding a doctor, navigating the system, and paying their health care bills. Unfortunately, Democrats' plans in Congress fail to focus on quality. House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, recently stated that the Democrats were proposing ""a government-run nightmare operated by federal bureaucrats."" If enacted, their plans would complicate the system and take more money from American pockets -- a nightmare, indeed. One report estimates more than 100 million people could drop their current health care coverage if the plans were open to all employers. One reason cited for the drop in current coverage -- businesses no longer offering private coverage -- would contradict the president's promise to allow Americans to keep their current coverage, if they like it. Imposed employer mandates could cost 4.7 million people their jobs. All of this means that many people who like their current health insurance might not be able to keep it and be forced into a new system, including a government option with lower reimbursement rates that might discourage their current doctor from continuing to treat them. Just as a doctor has the obligation to be honest and straightforward with their patients, Democrats in Washington must inform the public of the impact their plans will have on current insurance and the exact costs. As the economy struggles to recover, Americans are rightfully concerned about the potential cost of health reform, as shown by a recent CNN survey. Before we know how much it will cost and how it will affect those currently with insurance, we cannot have an open and honest debate on the merits of any proposal. While the House bill remains unscored by the Congressional Budget Office, health overhaul plans being crafted by Senate Democrats will likely cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years and could fail to cover millions of Americans. As a doctor, I know there is a better way to help all Americans achieve meaningful health care access. The president's proposed cuts in health care spending will result in limited treatment options for patients, and by shifting the burden of debt to the next generation of Americans, our children will be the ones helping to defer the outrageous costs. With our government's inability to maintain the Medicare and Medicaid programs that we currently fund, how much deeper can the hole get? The Government Accountability Office refers to Congress' failure to face Medicare's monetary difficulties as a ""leadership deficit."" Even some Blue Dog Democrats are asking if funding a new plan is even possible if the government cannot solve the funding problems of the current plans. Patients in these programs continue to be denied access to a doctor in many communities. A few months ago, I received an e-mail from a Medicaid patient diagnosed with a brain tumor. Doctors told her that she would likely be put on a six-month waiting list for brain surgeons currently serving Medicaid patients. For timely care, she had to borrow a neighbor's car, secure child care for her autistic child and drive four hours to a hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana. Patients in government-run plans obviously deserve better than this, so is this new government-run plan going to be any better? Republicans will give all Americans the liberty to select the plan that works best for them and let those who like their health care coverage keep it. We pledge to make quality health care coverage more available and less expensive, including those with pre-existing health conditions. We want to protect Americans from losing their current health coverage because an employer drops private coverage for a government-run program. This plan should also improve American lives through effective wellness, prevention and disease management programs, while finding innovative treatments for life-threatening diseases. We will ensure that medical decisions are made by patients and their doctors. By lowering costs and building more personalized plans, we can help more Americans develop a meaningful doctor-patient relationship. President Obama stated that ""if you like what you're getting, keep it. Nobody is forcing you to shift. No one will take it away, no matter what."" This rhetoric sounds comforting, but fellow Democrats don't seem to share his view -- as evidenced by their proposed bill. Some Democrats are completely unwilling to reach across the aisle. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Connecticut, said, ""My goal is to write a good bill; my goal is not bipartisanship."" Other Congressional Democrat members were told ""explicitly not to work with Republicans."" Moderate House Democrats even recently complained in a letter to several committee chairmen about being left out of any meaningful discussions on health-policy changes. Health reform should be open and transparent. No matter what party weighs in on the issue, Americans must fully comprehend the complicated decisions we face, and also understand how these new decisions will affect them. Leaders need to compromise, negotiate with members of both parties and ideologies, and reform health care the right way -- by developing a strong plan that encompasses the needs of all Americans.

13,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A proposed health-care compromise by the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee lacks a government-run insurance option favored by Democrats and would tax the most expensive health insurance plans, a source close to the discussions told CNN Monday. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, is the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As expected, the proposal from Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, excludes the public insurance option to compete with private insurers. However, it would allow for the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives -- an idea that some moderate Democrats and Republicans have expressed possible interest in supporting. The potential compromise proposal was sent to key Finance Committee negotiators Saturday night. It is considered a last-ditch effort to secure Republican votes for a health-care bill as President Obama pushes the issue with a planned speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night. So far, none of the three Republican senators involved in talks with Baucus on the compromise have indicated whether they support the version he is proposing. Congressional liberals are pushing strongly for inclusion of a public option; conservatives are sharply opposed. Obama has said he supports a public option but has not clearly indicated he will veto a bill that fails to include it. On Monday, Obama reiterated his support for a public option in a Labor Day speech to a union gathering in Cincinnati. He outlined Democratic health-care proposals that include a public option as part of a menu of insurance choices, including private health-care plans, that the legislation would create. ""I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs,"" Obama said to loud cheers. The president also indicated he would push hard for the House and Senate to move forward on passing health-care legislation in his upcoming address to Congress. ""The Congress and the country have been engaged in a vigorous debate for many months,"" Obama said. ""And the debate has been good, and that's important because we have to get this right. ""But every debate at some point comes to an end,"" he continued, to growing applause. ""At some point, it's time to decide. At some point, it's time to act. And Ohio, it's time to act to get this done."" Baucus' bill would cost less than $900 billion over 10 years, according to the source who spoke to CNN. The price tag is at least $100 billion less than any other health-care reform bill under consideration by Congress, the source said. As with other reform proposals, the bill would bar insurance companies from dropping a policyholder in the event of illness as long as that person has paid his or her premium in full. It adds new protections for people with pre-existing conditions and establishes tax credits to help low and middle-income families purchase insurance coverage, the source noted. It creates health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to buy insurance. The bill would be paid for, in part, by a new tax on health insurance companies that provide high-end ""Cadillac"" insurance plans, the source added. Supporters of such a tax -- initially proposed by Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and other Democrats several weeks ago -- say will it help curb the cost of health care by discouraging employers from offering such plans. They also argue that consumers, in turn, will be discouraged from overusing the health care system.  Watch senators discuss health care talks » . Critics claim the new tax will cause insurance companies to raise rates on all of their customers, even those without more expensive plans. The so-called ""Gang of Six"" Senate negotiators -- a group of three Democrats and three Republicans on the Finance Committee -- is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the proposal. The source, while stressing that the proposed bill is not a final product, said it closely reflects the group's work and areas of agreement. Obama's planned speech to Congress reflects how overhauling the nation's ailing health-care system has become his top domestic priority. He laced his speech Monday with references to health care costs rising at three times the rate of wages, and insurance industry practices that deny coverage for pre-existing conditions or prevent people from obtaining coverage if they lose their jobs. Multiple sources told CNN Friday that the administration is preparing for the possibility of delivering its own legislation to Capitol Hill sometime after the president's address. One source called the possibility of new legislation a ""contingency"" approach if efforts by Baucus to craft a deal fall through. A big open question is whether two Republican members of the Gang of Six -- Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming -- will support the bipartisan proposal. White House and Democratic leadership sources have said for some time they do not think Grassley and Enzi will sign on. A source close to the White House said Friday that the administration is leaning toward dropping the public option, and continues to zero in on trying to convince moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, another of the Senate Finance Committee negotiators, to come on board. Snowe and the White House have been discussing a trigger provision that would mandate creation of a public health insurance option if specific thresholds for expanded coverage and other changes are not met. Support by Snowe would improve the chances of the Senate's Democratic majority to compile the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster against a health care bill. The Senate Finance Committee is the last of five congressional committees needed to approve health-care legislation before it can be taken up by the full Senate and House of Representatives. Different forms of the legislation proposed by Democrats have already cleared three House committees, as well as the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

14,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As Democrats continue to splinter over President Obama's proposed health care reform plan, Republicans are taking the opportunity to home in on a key argument: A good bill deserves more time and deliberation. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, says his party may have enough votes to stall Democratic health care reform. Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Georgia, said Friday that Obama's rush to put a bill together is ""totally irresponsible."" ""Most of us believe that the decision as to major reform of how Americans get their health care in this country deserves at least as much time and deliberation as it would take to select a puppy to live in the White House,"" he said. ""It took the president six months to decide how long and which puppy he was going to have. ... To expect Congress to do something on major health care reform in six days is totally irresponsible."" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, speaking on conservative Hugh Hewitt's radio show recently, was asked about whether his party had enough votes to block health care from going forward. His answer: ""I think so. I really do."" ""If he is unsuccessful, which I anticipate and will predict he is, on getting a vote prior to the August recess, then I would say there's no way in the world they're going to get this done this year,"" he added. Obama's fight to get health care reform through Congress hit a major snag this week -- facing opposition from Republicans and fiscally conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats worried over the costs -- estimated to be around $1 trillion. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced that the Senate would not take up a vote before August recess -- a deadline that Obama had originally wanted.  Watch a GOP senator lash out at Obama's plan » . Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas responded to Democratic criticism that the GOP has failed to present a viable plan. ""When the Democrats say we don't have a plan ... where's their plan? If they can't get a bill out of committee, where's their plan?"" he said. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said it's hard to combat the Democrats' proposed legislation when it changes ""by 100 pages every time you walk into the room."" The GOP's fight is also getting political, namely looking ahead to the upcoming midterm election. ""I just hope the president keeps talking about it, keeps trying to rush it through. We can stall it. And that's going to be a huge gain for those of us who want to turn this thing over in the 2010 election,"" Inhofe said. Last week, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, was quoted as telling the group Conservatives for Patients' Rights, which opposes Obama's health care plan, that ""if we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo. It will break him."" Obama debunked DeMint's claim during a live prime time news conference Wednesday night at the White House. ""I've heard that one Republican strategist told his party that even though they may want to compromise, it's better politics to 'go for the kill.' Another Republican senator said that defeating health reform is about 'breaking' me,"" he said. ""Let me be clear: This isn't about me,"" Obama said, noting that he and every member of Congress -- including those trying to scuttle health care reform legislation -- ""have great health insurance."" Obama's chief-of-staff, Rahm Emanuel, took a swipe at the GOP's political maneuvering. ""At least they're honest about their motivation,"" Emanuel told National Public Radio Friday. ""Their view about health care is about defeating President Obama. Politically, I actually appreciate what they said.""",0.86019874,6489
15,"(CNN) -- Doctor James Braude leads a group medical practice in an elegant Atlanta, Georgia, office decorated with designer furnishings. It doesn't look like a charity asking for handouts. But it is asking. Obama, pictured July 1 in Virginia, has been touring the states to promote his plan to voters. ""On some days we've counted up to 30 patients a day who've lost their jobs and their health insurance,"" Braude said. So Braude and his colleagues offer as much free care as they can afford. The doctors have also begun discreetly inviting paying patients to contribute to a fund, helping more people get care they haven't got the money for. ""We're doctors. We're addicted to helping people. And when we can't, we go through withdrawal."" Millions of Americans have always gone without the kind of routine medical care that is seen as a basic right in many countries. The U.S. economic downturn -- meaning people lose health insurance when they lose their job -- and the election of President Barack Obama have coincided to increase both the need and the opportunity to address the plight of uninsured America. Obama's ambition is to provide insurance for the estimated 50 million Americans without coverage.  Watch why many in rural U.S. have concerns » . The insurance is expected to cover doctors, hospital care and prescription drugs. But just about every detail is still being negotiated so it's not certain who would be covered, what they would be covered for or whether people who don't want insurance would be forced to have it and pay for it. The plans that emerge could become the Obama administration's most ambitious domestic program and potentially a big, early test of his presidency. American medical care needs attention . Even though nearly 50 million of its roughly 300 million people have no routine health care, the United States spends more going to the doctor than any other industrialized nation in the world. Fully one-sixth of the economy is devoted to it. Under the current hybrid system, the U.S. Government pays for health care for ex-military, the extremely poor and the elderly. But the vast majority of Americans have to pay for their own health care and most do it where they work; many employers arrange health insurance and partly subsidize the premiums. The rapidly rising cost is crushing all kinds of businesses, from car companies to family farms. At the same time, hospitals and doctors say they are falling behind because the payments they receive from insurance companies aren't keeping up with their costs. ""Within a decade we will be spending one out of every five dollars we earn on health care,"" Obama said recently. ""In 30 years, it will be one out of every three. That is untenable, that is unacceptable, and I will not allow it as president of the United States."" The politics: Deep disagreement . There is a lot of disagreement about what to do. Congress has the job of actually turning the push for change into a functioning government program. Democratic lawmakers don't all support the president's plan or agree on how to pay for it. Republicans are split in a different way. Some lawmakers are trying to influence the Democrats' plans and others are proposing entirely different alternatives. ""If you look at their plan, it really is a big government-run plan that will take control of the delivery of health care in America,"" said Republican congressional leader John Boehner. His suggestion: ""Improve the current system so it works better."" The most profound disagreement centers on whether Washington should create its own new health-insurance concern to compete with the private companies that provide insurance now. Obama and many Democrats favor it; Republicans are dead set against it. Part of the problem is that insurance companies fear the government will put them out of business, by favoring or subsidizing its own scheme. The other part of the problem is more basic and ideological. The U.S. government already runs enormous health-insurance programs for the poor, the elderly and military veterans -- but many Americans see potentially mandatory government health-insurance as the foreign-born offspring of socialist states. The economics: More debt . Political opposition notwithstanding, the economics are going to be a problem too. Health care is a $2 trillion-dollar-a-year industry that would have to expand to cover millions of people who are now uninsured. The president has some ideas for new efficiencies but most estimates suggest the total cost of caring for Americans would rise dramatically. Washington is already carrying record debt and would have to find a way to pay for it. One assessment by the Congressional Budget Office of the Senate Democrat plan estimated it would cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years and only provide coverage for about 16 million Americans. There's also the possibility that the impact of reform on many employers and virtually every wage-earner across the country will have a spillover effect on the economy as a whole, still lodged in recession. The health care industry: Undecided . Then there is the place where the politics and the economy overlap: the health care industry. Doctors alone have spent roughly two-thirds of a billion dollars lobbying lawmakers in the last 10 years, according to the independent Center for Responsive Politics. Add pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, nurses and other health care professionals and you get one of the most influential forces in U.S. politics. They successfully organized to defeat health care reform when the Clinton administration tried it 15 years ago. The industry benefits from one crucial thing: Americans like their doctors. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found 54 percent of people worry that their health care costs would go up if the administration's proposals get passed and only one in five thinks that his or her families would be better off under the Obama plan. With all that in mind, Atlanta's Dr. Braude says he's optimistic the reform can succeed. If not, he says, ""we go back to the same system and we have 50 million people without insurance, which means you are one brain tumor away from bankruptcy.""",0.8591929,5194
17,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders engaged in a spirited but civil debate at a health care summit Thursday, finding agreement on some issues but appearing to find little common ground on how to move forward in a bipartisan way. ""I don't know, frankly, whether we can close that gap,"" said President Obama as the day-long meeting closed. If agreement is not reached, he said, there will be ""a lot of arguments about procedures in Congress about moving forward,"" an apparent reference to using a parliamentary shortcut under which a health care bill could be passed with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority the body requires to overcome the filibuster which Republicans have threatened to use. ""My hope had been there might be enough areas of overlap to realistically think about moving forward without a situation in which everyone just goes to their respective corners and this ends up being a political fight,"" he said. ""Frankly, I was discourage by the outcome,"" Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, told reporters after the meeting. He urged the Democrats to ""start over and go step by step and target the areas of possible agreement that we discussed in the meeting today."" Sen. John Boehner, R-Ohio, sounded equally unenthusiastic. ""I think the American people want us to work together on common steps to make our current system work better,"" he said. ""We can't do it within the framework of a 2,700-page bill."" Live updates from the health care summit . ""The president let everybody talk and talk and talk,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who called Obama ""the most patient man in the world."" Though there were areas of agreement, he said, ""every Republican used the same talking points."" He, too, appeared to raise the specter of attempting to move forward through the parliamentary shortcut, known as reconciliation. ""It's time we do something and we're going to do it,"" the Nevada Democrat said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ""not overly optimistic"" that the Democrats would be able to attract Republican votes for the health care bill. Obama said in opening remarks that ""it is absolutely critical to begin now moving on what is one of the biggest drags on the economy."" The situation affects not just people without health insurance, but also those who have it, he said. ""The problem is not getting better,"" he said. ""It is getting worse."" Share your reaction to the summit . Obama called on Republican and Democratic leaders at the much-publicized summit to ""not focus on where we differ, but focus on where we agree."" The differences were evident, though, in what each side believes should happen next. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who made the opening remarks for his party, said Democrats should scrap existing bills passed by the House and Senate and start over on new legislation.  Watch what areas Democrats and Republicans can agree on . That's not going to happen, Democrats answered, saying Americans cannot wait. ""For them, they don't have time for us to start over,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Jon Kyl, the Senate Republican Whip, pointed out that a major philosophical difference between the two sides is who should be in charge of the health care system -- the government or private industry. ""There's so much in the bills you have supported that puts so much control in Washington,"" Kyl said to Obama. House Republican Whip Eric Cantor also highlighted that concern, pointing out that Republicans are nearly unanimous in their opposition to the bills. ""There is a reason we voted no,"" Cantor said to Obama. ""It does have to do with the philosophical differences you pointed out. It also has to do with our fear that Washington can define what are essential health benefits."" Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin made an impassioned plea for passage of health care reform, saying the current system discriminates against people who are already sick. Watch Harkin's plea for everyone to have insurance . Racial segregation has been outlawed, he said, ""however we still allow segregation today on the basis of your health."" Fellow Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller urged greater oversight of the health insurance sector, which he called ""a shark that swims just below the water."" ""This is a rapacious industry that does what it wants, unknown to the people of America except on an individual basis,"" Rockefeller said. Critics had said before the nationally televised summit started that it would amount to a public relations stunt. ""This is about theater,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. ""This is not about substance, unfortunately.""  Watch what's at stake at the health care summit . Obama addressed that concern in his opening remarks. ""I hope this isn't political theater where people are playing to the camera,"" he said. Obama said Republicans and Democrats seem to agree that costs have to be contained. ""It's absolutely true that if all we're doing is adding more people to a broken system, then costs will continue to skyrocket,"" he said. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, who is a physician, listed several ways to cut costs, including focusing on disease prevention and management as well as cracking down on fraud. Coburn also blasted what he called the ""extortion"" behind frivolous lawsuits that make doctors victims of the current legal system. ""A large number of the tests we order every day are not for the patients, they're for the doctors,"" Coburn said. Another Republican physician, Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, said doctors also would like a plan that would ""simplify, streamline and standardize all paperwork that is involved."" The cumbersome paperwork, he said, ""takes you away from patient care."" The discussion took a testy tone when Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona complained about how the Democrats handled the process of approving the legislation. McCain, who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential race, said candidate Obama had pledged eight times that the health care debate would be conducted in the open and televised by C-SPAN. Instead, McCain said, the legislation was ""produced behind closed doors ... with unsavory deals."" Obama tried to break in, but McCain asked to be allowed to finish. After McCain was done, Obama seemed to flash some anger when he said, ""We're not campaigning. The election is over."" Said McCain with a slight laugh, ""I'm reminded of that every day."" At one point, both men tried to talk over each other. ""The focus should not be on the issue of how we get a bill done,"" Obama said. McCain replied that ""the American people care about what we do and how we do it."" Obama cut off the discussion when he said, ""We can have a debate about process or we can have a debate about how we help the American people.""  Fact Check: How common is the Senate use of reconciliation? After the meeting, McCain told reporters in a conference call, ""A conversation like this is bound to be a good thing. I just wish we had started it a year ago instead of jamming it through."" He said he hopes the Democrats will refrain from using reconciliation, urging that ""the 60-vote procedure of the Senate be protected."" Obama also seemed to take a shot at Cantor, who stacked the voluminous House and Senate health care reform bills on the table in front of him. The president called the display ""props"" and said, ""These are the kinds of political things we do that prevent us from having a conversation."" On Wednesday, Sen. Chris Dodd, a key author of the Senate health care bill, told reporters flatly that if Republicans continued to demand that Democrats scrap their health care proposals and start over, ""then there's nothing to talk about."" But McConnell argued that starting over is exactly what Republicans want. ""Unless they're willing to do that, I think it's nearly impossible to imagine a scenario under which we can reach agreement because we don't think we ought to pass a 2,700-page bill that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy,"" McConnell said.  Watch as opposing sides protest at health summit . He warned the political consequences would be severe if Democrats moved forward without Republican support. Dodd said Democrats and Republicans could find common ground in some areas, such as the Republican push to allow insurers to sell insurance across state lines. He called the GOP proposal ""a legitimate issue,"" but said Democrats already have a version of that proposal in their legislation. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed confidence Thursday that a bill will pass. ""We're very close to health care reform for the American people,"" he said. Three top Democratic sources privately told CNN the new goal is to pass the final legislation by the end of March or else Congress will have to move back to other issues like job creation and unfinished spending bills.

18,"(CNN) -- The battle raging over President Obama's health care plan has spread from across the aisles in Congress to across the country. A Tampa, Florida, health care reform meeting sparks noisy exchanges between attendees. Senators this week joined their colleagues from the House at town hall meetings as they spent their August recess in their home districts. But disruptive protests are turning town hall meetings into shouting matches and drowning out discussion over what is and isn't in health care plans in the House and Senate. Videos of the protests have been circulating on the Internet, showing raucous crowds heckling their congressmen, and carrying posters with devil horns drawn on lawmakers' heads, swastikas or Obama with Adolf Hitler's mustache.

Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who had a town hall meeting disrupted by angry protesters earlier this month, said he had never experienced such emotion in his 15 years of holding such forums. Democratic Rep. Brad Miller of North Carolina even had a death threat phoned into his office. A caller said that if Miller supported Obama's plan, it could cost him his life, Miller told CNN. ""Of course we want a full debate. Of course we want people who have dissenting views from the administration and Congress to have a full hearing. But that's not what this is about. That's not the intent of most of these people. It's not the way the press is covering it,"" Mark Halperin, editor-at-large and senior political analyst for TIME magazine, said on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" The protesters' gimmicks, Halperin said, are grabbing the public and media's attention, and valid arguments over the cost and content of the proposals are being put on the back burner. ""There needs to be a debate in America on whether we should have universal health care. There needs to be a debate on the president's ideas. If these protesters have ideas, great. Let's hear them. But if they're just stunts to cause a disruption that gets the media tripped in every time, again, I think it's bad for the country whether you want the president's plan or not,"" he said.  Watch what Halperin says about the town hall turmoil » . Obama's health care battle has been compared to former President Bill Clinton's failed effort more than 15 years ago, but CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said the climate toward health care reform was actually more negative back then. Clinton's plan had less public support than Obama's, and Clinton himself was less popular than Obama, Schneider said. Clinton's plan also barely got off the ground when it went to Congress, and Obama's proposals have already been through a few congressional committees. So why didn't lawmakers experience the same backlash during the Clinton years? ""Three reasons,"" Schneider said. First of all, ""the calendar."" Clinton proposed his plan in September 1993, and by the time Congress went on recess in August of the following year, the plan was dead.  Learn more about global health care systems » . Secondly, people didn't use the Internet the way they use it today, ""so you didn't have the viral communications that rally people to attend town halls."" And finally, experience. ""Conservatives are emboldened by what happened to the Clinton plan. They want to relive 1994,"" Schneider said. Democrats have accused conservative groups of manufacturing the outrage, while others say the uproar is a reflection of the opposition to Obama's plans. ""These are average Americans that are concerned about this long litany of borrowing and spending and bailouts and government takeover of one industry after another. And this government takeover of health care is just the last straw for many Americans,"" Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana, told ""Fox News"" on Monday. As the emotion has intensified, misinformation has spread about what is and isn't in current health care proposals. ""People are just getting information that's flat wrong,"" Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, told CNN on Monday as a town hall meeting she held came to an end. One of the allegations that picked up traction in recent days is that Obama's plan encourages euthanasia. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin fueled the charge on her Facebook page Friday, writing that ""the sick, the elderly, and the disabled"" would suffer as doctors have to ""ration care."" In her post, the former Republican vice presidential candidate said Obama's health care plan would create a ""death panel"" that would weigh whether her parents or son Trig were ""worthy of health care."" Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean told CNN on Sunday that Palin had deliberately fabricated the charges. ""About euthanasia, they're just totally erroneous. She just made that up,"" he said. ""Just like the 'Bridge to Nowhere' that she supposedly didn't support. ""There's nothing like euthanasia in the bill. I practiced medicine for a long time, and of course you have to have end-of-life discussions -- the patients want that. ... Euthanasia's not in this bill."" McCaskill said she hoped Monday that she was able to correct some of false information out there. ""The notion that I would ever, or that our government would ever do anything to cut short or dismiss the quality of life for our seniors is so offensive to me as an American. ... There's no rationing of health care that's being proposed for our elderly,"" she said. ""Hopefully, I was able to reassure people that -- not in America. That's not going to happen."" In his weekend radio address, Obama sought to dispel what he called ""the outlandish rumors that reform will promote euthanasia, cut Medicaid or bring about a government takeover of health care. That's simply not true.""

19,"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will sign sweeping health care reform legislation into law at the White House on Tuesday, according to two Democratic officials familiar with the planning. Obama also will hit the road to sell the measure to a still-skeptical public, giving a speech Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama launched his grass-roots drive for health care reform in Iowa City in May 2007, according to Gibbs. The bill, which constitutes the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees in more than four decades, passed the House of Representatives late Sunday night with no Republican support. It was approved by the Senate in December. A separate compromise package of changes also passed the House on Sunday and still needs to be approved by the Senate. The officials noted that the Senate cannot begin debate on the package before Obama signs the underlying bill into law. Passage of the bill was a huge boost for Obama, who made health care reform a domestic priority. Aides said Monday that Obama exchanged handshakes, hugs and ""high-fives"" with staffers when the outcome of the House vote became apparent. ""I haven't seen the president so happy about anything other than his family since I've known him,"" said senior adviser David Axelrod, adding that Obama's jubilation Sunday night exceeded his election victory in November 2008. ""He was excited that night, but not like last night."" Republicans promised to continue fighting the reforms, with 11 state attorneys general -- all Republican -- planning lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the bill's mandate for people to buy health insurance and requirements for states to comply with its provisions. Senior Republicans in Congress warned that voters will judge Democrats harshly in November's midterm elections, with Sen. John McCain of Arizona saying the Democratic-passed bill killed any chance of bipartisan support on legislation for the rest of the year. ""There will be no cooperation for the rest of this year,"" McCain said in an interview with KFYI radio in Arizona. ""They have poisoned the well in what they have done and how they have done it."" Highlights of what's in the bill . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, however, said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill, and he challenged McCain and other Republicans to campaign for the November election against benefits of the health care bill such as tax credits for small businesses and an end to insurance company practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. The overall $940 billion plan is projected to extend insurance coverage to roughly 32 million additional Americans. Most Americans will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine. Larger employers will be required to provide coverage or risk financial penalties. Lifetime coverage limits will be banned, and insurers will be barred from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions. The compromise package would add to the bill's total cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle- and lower-income families. The measure would scale back the bill's taxes on expensive insurance plans. House Democrats are expected to celebrate passage of the bill at a news conference with reform advocates Tuesday afternoon. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who spearheaded her husband's failed health reform effort in the 1990s, said earlier in the day that Obama's success was an example of the president's tenacity. ""If you ever doubt the resolve of President Obama to stay with a job, look at what we got done for the United States last night when it came to passing quality affordable health care for everyone,"" Clinton said during a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Was it all worth it for Obama? Observers warn, however, that the road ahead for health care reform in the Senate may be rocky. Democratic leaders are using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which will allow the compromise plan to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. But according to Senate rules, members are still allowed to offer unlimited amendments and challenges. In one of the first of many attempts Republicans say they will make to try to amend or kill the package, GOP aides went to Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin on Monday to argue that the compromise bill violates rules of the reconciliation process because of the way it affects Social Security. For that reason, GOP aides said they argued, the bill should not even be allowed to be debated. However, Frumin, according to a senior Republican and a Democratic aide, informed both parties he disagreed with the GOP assessment, and would not block the bill from reaching the Senate floor. ""There's hope that [the vote] would be done within a short period of time, like a week or so,"" said Tim McBride, a health economist and associate dean of public health at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. ""But the Senate is complicated and doesn't have the discipline that the House does."" Once the package hits the Senate floor, the chamber's rules stipulate that there must be 20 hours of debate. But that 20 hours may prove to be more of a suggestion than an indicator of what will happen, according to Cheryl Block, a law professor at Washington University's School of Law. ""It could get all messy and could go on forever if [Republicans] threw up amendment after amendment,"" Block said. ""Theoretically, it should only take 20 hours, but it will likely take longer because Republicans have things up their sleeve."" If any provision in the package of changes is rejected or changed, the entire package would then have to go back to the House for another vote. iReport: Share your views on health care reform . House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, presented a letter to House Democrats on Saturday stating that their Senate counterparts ""believe that health insurance reform cannot wait and must not be obstructed."" So far, two of the 59 senators in the Democratic caucus, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, have said they will oppose the compromise package.

20,"(CNN) -- President Obama built his push for a sweeping overhaul of the health care system on the premise that reform is essential for economic recovery. President Obama has said overhauling health care is a key part of economic recovery. But with some economists saying the recession shows signs of ending, will that weaken Obama's argument? ""If the economy is picking up, then more people are going to get jobs and more people are going to have health insurance, and so they are going to be less concerned with health care reform because they will figure, 'I'm taken care of,' "" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. But Julian Epstein, a Democratic strategist, said a recovering economy will help Obama's push for health care legislation because ""it will be a huge shot in the arm for Obama's political capital."" ""It lessens people's anxieties that are being stirred up by the opponents of health care reform. It gives credibility to the argument that government has an appropriate role to play in solving the nation's problems,"" Epstein said. Obama ran on a campaign to fix the health care system, and since taking office, the president repeatedly has tried to show how this overhaul fits into his broader economic strategy. In a speech in June before the American Medical Association, Obama warned that inaction could have dire consequences. ""Make no mistake: The cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It is an escalating burden on our families and businesses. It is a ticking time bomb for the federal budget. And it is unsustainable for the United States of America,"" he said. While the president has said health care is his top domestic priority this year, the public seems to disagree. Eighty-three percent of people are satisfied with their current health care, and 74 percent are satisfied with their health insurance, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released last week. ""Health care reform has not been the top priority for voters. No. 1 is jobs. No. 2 is the deficit and government spending. Health care is third,"" said Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst. But Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and director of American studies at Georgetown University, said the public isn't as concerned about the economics-driven case to overhaul health care. ""I personally think that the vast majority of the public doesn't get that connection between the economy and health care. I think they're seeing it more as a personal issue -- something that could affect them, their families, their friends,"" she said, noting that because people have an emotional involvement in the debate, the public is not likely to let it drop. That personal anxiety has manifested itself at town hall meetings across the country, where, angry protesters and other citizens have showed up to voice their doubts to their lawmakers. Voters have asked their lawmakers what reform means for them -- and how they can be assured that Obama's proposals are good ideas. The August congressional recess, however, could end up being a blessing in disguise for Democrats, Epstein said. ""It may persuade enough of them that they do need to be more moderate and incremental in the approach, and they may actually come up with a package that is even more popular than what would have otherwise been, had they tried to get the bill through before August,"" he said. If the economy recovers, plenty of Republicans and even a few Democrats will remind voters that Obama was wrong about the importance of reform to economic recovery, Schneider said. ""What will Obama say? That the recovery cannot be sustained over the long term without health care reform."" Obama sent a similar message in his radio address last weekend, citing the slightly better than expected job numbers as ""a sign that we've begun to put the brakes on this recession and that the worst may be behind us."" ""But we must do more than rescue our economy from this immediate crisis; we must rebuild it stronger than before. We must lay a new foundation for future growth and prosperity, and a key pillar of a new foundation is health insurance reform -- reform that we are now closer to achieving than ever before,"" he said. But even if the effort does take on a lower profile, it could still have real consequences for Democrats, as it did 15 years ago, Schneider said. President Clinton's push to overhaul health care failed, and the issue faded from the agenda as the economy recovered, but the ramifications were felt in the next election cycle. ""Clinton had to scale back his agenda. His big ideas for health care reform turned into protecting 'the safety net.' And, of course, the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years, and it took them another 12 years to get it back,"" Schneider said.",0.84876955,7814
21,"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate on Monday opened what is expected to be a lengthy and rancorous debate on a sweeping bill to overhaul the nation's health care system. In statements laced with heated and conflicting rhetoric, Senate Democrats and Republicans outlined opposing positions on the 2,074-page Democratic measure that would provide health insurance to an additional 31 million people at a cost of almost $850 billion. Democrats led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada framed the debate as historic and said the bill would provide vital health insurance for almost all Americans, hold down spiraling costs that threaten the U.S. economy and instill needed reforms to ensure the long-term solvency of the government-run Medicare health program for senior citizens. ""In the greatest country on Earth, no American should die simply because they don't have health insurance,"" said Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, one of the bill's architects, while Reid said the bill ""saves money, saves lives and saves Medicare."" Republicans countered that the bill was too big, too expensive and would cause more harm than good. Sen. John McCain of Arizona called it a ""sham"" and a ""2,074-page monstrosity full of measures that would impair the abilities, particularly of our senior citizens, to keep the benefits they've been promised."" McCain immediately proposed sending the bill back to committee to remove all provisions intended to bring down the costs of Medicare. He cited proposed cuts to Medicare, including $118 billion in subsidies provided to private insurers for Medicare Advantage -- an enhanced benefits program for senior citizens. ""There is no math, old or new, that gets you to no change in the benefits they have under Medicare Advantage and yet cuts $120 billion,"" McCain said. A vote on McCain's proposal was likely on Tuesday. The House has passed its version of a health care bill, and if the Senate passes its bill, the two measures would be merged by a congressional conference committee. Both chambers then would have to approve the revised bill before it could go to President Obama's desk. On Monday, debate quickly bogged down in Republican procedural objections, causing Reid to lament: ""This is not a good way to start this debate."" Republican Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming challenged a motion by Reid that he said would unfairly cut off the proposal of amendments, including McCain's planned Republican amendment to prevent cuts to Medicare. While Reid's motion failed, Enzi labeled it a stunt. So far, Republicans unanimously oppose the health care bill. The Senate voted 60-39 to launch debate on the measure, overcoming a Republican filibuster through support from every member of the Democratic caucus. Reid also will need 60 votes to eventually close the debate, and his ability to secure that support remains uncertain. The debate will feature amendments intended to delete or change controversial provisions, including creation of a government-run public health insurance option to compete against private insurers, tax increases and provisions intended to prevent federal tax dollars from paying for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life. For the most part, battle lines are clearly drawn. Liberal-minded senators such as Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who sits with the Democratic caucus, favor a public option as the best way to force competition on private insurers to bring down costs, while fiscally conservative Democrats such as Nebraska's Ben Nelson are concerned about the cost and scope of a government-run alternative. Nelson has said he would join a Republican filibuster against closing debate on the bill if it retains the current public option provision, which allows states to opt out of a national plan. Another Democratic caucus member, independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, says he also will prevent a final vote if the bill contains any form of public option. On the Republican side, none of the 40 senators supports a public option, but one -- moderate Olympia Snowe of Maine -- has discussed a trigger mechanism that would automatically bring a public option if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet. The trigger idea is considered the lone chance of a compromise that could gain the support of any Republicans. For Democrats, each vote is crucial. Overcoming a filibuster requires support every member of the Democratic caucus, so if Lieberman or others oppose a public option, Reid would need a GOP senator to switch sides on the bill. Senate Democrats concede that some changes are necessary to get the health care bill passed. They contend their comprehensive approach is necessary to reform a system in which higher costs are draining the national economy and harming businesses and individuals. Republicans call for an incremental approach that they say would reduce the costs of health care without needing to create bureaucracies and raise taxes in a huge overhaul. Other risky issues for Senate Democrats include abortion and tax increases to pay for health care reform. The bill includes tax increases aimed at those earning more than $200,000 a year and insurers providing so-called ""Cadillac"" health plans worth more than $8,500 a year for individuals or $23,000 for families. It also would set a 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic surgery. In contrast, a separate health care bill narrowly passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month includes an income tax surcharge on individuals earning more than $500,000 a year and couples making more than $1 million. Republicans say any tax increase is bad in a struggling economy because it hinders growth and gets passed on to consumers, while Democrats argue the bill's tax provisions wouldn't hit the lower or middle class and would create incentive for private insurers to lower the cost of policies. However, a key Democratic constituency -- organized labor -- opposes taxing the ""Cadillac"" health plans negotiated for workers in lieu of wage increases. On abortion, the House bill has more restrictive language regarding the use of federal funding, and some Senate Democrats say they oppose adding it to their chamber's proposal. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Senate health care bill would reduce the federal deficit by about $130 billion over the next 10 years, through 2019. Any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be ""subject to substantial uncertainty,"" but probably would result in ""small reductions in federal budget deficits,"" the budget office report said. It also reported that health insurance premiums would remain roughly the same for most people, with costs for lower-income Americans reduced due to subsidies under the plan. According to the budget office, more than 80 percent of Americans would remain in employer-based health plans. Both the Senate and House bills would require individuals to buy health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Unlike the House version, the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care. The two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes, including creating health insurance exchanges, expanding Medicaid, subsidizing insurance for low- and some middle-income families, and capping out-of-pocket medical expenses, while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.

22,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama often talks about all of the forces lining up against his health care plan. But there's one critic who has remained relatively mum in the debate. Dr. David Scheiner was President Obama's personal physician for 22 years. David Scheiner, a Chicago, Illinois-based doctor, has taken a hard look at the president's prescription for health care reform and sees bad medicine. ""This isn't that kind of health care program that I think is going to work,"" he said. So what makes Scheiner so special? He was Obama's personal physician for 22 years, and voted for the former Illinois senator in the 2008 presidential election. Scheiner thinks the president's plan doesn't go far enough. In his mind, the worst part of the proposal is that ""private insurers continue to be a part of the health scheme.""  Watch Scheiner talk about his objections » . ""Everybody keeps saying we don't want the government involved in health care,"" Scheiner said in an interview. ""But the government is involved in Medicare, and it works."" Scheiner would rather see the nation adopt a single-payer system like the ones in Canada and Europe. The financing system relies on one ""payer"" -- which could be a government-run agency -- to fund all health care costs billed by doctors, hospitals and other health professionals. The benefits, advocates say, is that pricey administrative costs are cut, resulting in large savings to patients. It's something that an up-and-coming coming state Sen. Obama talked about  six years ago. ""I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care plan. ... But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately, because first we've got to take back the White House, and we've got take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House,"" Obama said in 2003. But that position evolved during the campaign. ""If I were designing a system from scratch, then I'd probably set up a single-payer system. But the problem is we're not starting from scratch,"" Obama said in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in August 2008. Now, the president favors giving Americans the option of joining a government-run plan that would compete with private insurers.  Watch more on the health care debate » . ""Nobody is talking about some government takeover of health care. I'm tired of hearing that,"" Obama said in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday. But Scheiner says that nobody has seen the details of that option, making it a hard sell for the president. ""We don't even fully know what the public option is going to be. If the public option is too good, patients who are sick will flock to it, and I'm not sure it will be able to support itself."" Scheiner almost had a chance to confront the president with his concerns. He was invited to a recent televised town hall meeting with Obama, but he says he was dropped from the program. ""I just hope that the Congress, the American public and the president will hear some of my words,"" he said. ""We've got to do something better."" Scheiner finally had a chance to have his say Thursday. He and other doctors who support a single-payer system gathered in Washington to meet with lawmakers and rally supporters. He may not be the president's doctor anymore, but Scheiner says he's trying to save the patient before it's too late.

23,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congress voted to halt planned cuts in Medicare payments to doctors Tuesday, overriding President Bush's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians. President Bush says he objects to the bill because it takes choices ""away from seniors to pay physicians."" The new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors, part of a scheduled cost-saving formula that went into effect July 1. The money for the doctors will be taken from the government-subsidized Medicare Advantage program, which the Bush administration strongly supports. Bush spiked the bill Tuesday, telling lawmakers they would be ""taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians."" ""I urge the Congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in Medicare spending, increases competition and efficiency, implements principles of value-driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending,"" he said in his veto message. The Senate voted 70-26 to enact the law over Bush's objections, the third time in his presidency that Congress has overridden his veto. The margin in the House of Representatives was a lopsided 383-41, well beyond the two-thirds majority needed. The American Medical Association lobbied heavily for the bill, warning that its members could be forced to curtail seeing Medicare patients if the cuts went into effect. But insurers, which receive government subsidies to offer Medicare Advantage plans, warned that 2 million seniors could lose health benefits if it passed. A total of 21 Senate Republicans joined 47 Democrats and two independents in the override vote. Supporters broke a GOP-led filibuster of the bill last week, aided by the dramatic return of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Kennedy's vote came in his first appearance on the Senate floor since surgery to remove a brain tumor in early June. Though he did not vote Tuesday, Kennedy praised his colleagues for overriding the ""misguided"" veto. ""It's a great vote, and a great day for America's seniors,"" he said in a written statement. Those Republicans who opposed the bill argued that it would roll back many of the changes made to Medicare in 2003, when Congress created privately run, government-subsidized prescription drug coverage and expanded the role of private insurers in other coverage. ""These are not pro-patient policies,"" said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona. ""Rather, the bill reduces access, benefits and choices for Medicare beneficiaries."" But critics of the 2003 reforms say Medicare Advantage subsidies end up costing more than the government would pay to cover the same people through regular Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will reduce federal spending by $12.5 billion by 2013, largely by reducing Medicare Advantage enrollment. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said the bill also made ""vital improvements"" by supporting rural health care and lowering fees for mental health care. ""Today, we can stand up for Medicare,"" she said. ""We did it last week, when we came together and voted for this measure by a veto-proof margin, and I believe we can do it today by overriding that veto."" Congress had passed only two bills over Bush's objections: a $23 billion water-project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007 and a $300 billion farm bill he spiked in May. The Medicare system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly Americans. Rising health care costs have made Medicare a growing part of the federal budget, and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age. While the debate was raging over the bill, the AMA said the cuts could lead to a ""meltdown"" of the government's health care system for the elderly. A recent survey by the group found that 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new Medicare patients they can take on if the cuts go into effect. ""We stand at the brink of a Medicare meltdown. ... For doctors, this is not a partisan issue; it's a patient access issue,"" AMA President Nancy Nielsen said in a statement after last week's Senate vote. The AMA ran radio and TV ads over the July Fourth congressional recess targeting 10 Republican senators, seven of whom are up for re-election. The AARP, the nation's largest organization of retired people, and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts. Gerald Harmon, a family physician who practices in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer Medicare patients, making it difficult for the program's elderly patients to get the care they need. ""This Medicare access problem is a real issue, not just a political football,"" said Harmon, who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for Medicare. ""It affects your dad when he's sick. It affects my patients in my practice. This has to be addressed."" CNN's Elaine Quijano and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",0.83805156,807
24,"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration raised the stakes in the health care debate Monday, releasing a new blueprint that seeks to bridge the gap between measures passed by the Senate and House of Representatives last year. If enacted, the president's sweeping compromise plan would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. The White House said it would extend coverage to 31 million Americans. Among other things, the White House said it would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies. It increases the threshold -- relative to the Senate bill -- under which a tax on high-end health insurance plans would kick in. As with both the House and Senate plans, it includes significant reductions in Medicare spending in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program. President Obama's plan does not include a government-run public health insurance option, an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed by both Republicans and key Democratic moderates. It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill worked in by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, that would exempt his Midwestern state from paying increased Medicaid expenses. Administration officials said Obama's measure would cut the deficit by $100 billion over the next 10 years. They estimate the total cost of the bill to be $950 billion in the next decade. The Senate bill would cost an estimated $871 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, while the more expansive House plan has been estimated to cost more than $1 trillion. The release of Obama's plan sets the stage for a critical televised health care summit Thursday with top congressional Republicans. The White House is trying to pressure GOP leaders to present a detailed alternative proposal in advance of the meeting. ""We view this as the opening bid for the health meeting"" on Thursday, White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told reporters. ""We took our best shot at bridging the differences"" between the House and Senate bills. ""It is our hope the Republicans will come together around [their] plan and post it online"" before the meeting. President's health care blueprint . Pfeiffer said Obama will come to Thursday's meeting ""with an open mind."" The president's willing to back decent Republican ideas if the two sides can have an ""honest, open, substantive discussion"" in which ""both parties can get off their talking points,"" he said. GOP leaders have indicated they will attend the meeting but have urged Democrats to scrap the Senate and House bills completely. They characterized Obama's proposal Monday as setting the stage for a meeting that will amount to little more than political posturing. ""The president has crippled the credibility of this week's summit by proposing the same massive government takeover of health care based on a partisan bill the American people have already rejected,"" said House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""This new Democrats-only backroom deal doubles down on the same failed approach that will drive up premiums, destroy jobs, raise taxes and slash Medicare benefits. This week's summit clearly has all the makings of a Democratic infomercial."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, released a statement calling the plan ""disappointing that Democrats in Washington either aren't listening or are completely ignoring what Americans across the country have been saying."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed the GOP criticisms, arguing that Republican leaders had asked for this week's meeting for months. ""If they're not the party of no, Thursday's the perfect venue to be the party of yes,"" Gibbs said. Highlights of Obama's proposal . Under Obama's plan: . • The health and human services secretary would work with a seven-member board of doctors, economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium hikes. This Health Insurance Rate Authority would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved, although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators. • New health insurance subsidies would be provided to families of four making up to $88,000 annually, or 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Compared with the Senate bill, Obama's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $44,000 and $66,000, according to the White House. Compared with the House legislation, it lowers premiums for families making between $55,000 and $88,000. • The Medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole"" would be closed by 2020. Under current law, Medicare stops covering drug costs after a plan and beneficiary have spent more than $2,830 on prescription drugs. It starts paying again after an individual's out-of-pocket expenses exceed $4,550. • A 40 percent tax would be imposed on insurance companies providing so-called ""Cadillac"" health plans valued at more than $27,000 for families. The tax would kick in starting in 2018 for all plans. In contrast, the Senate bill would apply the tax to plans valued at more than $23,000 for families. The House bill does not include the tax, which labor unions vehemently oppose. • The federal government would assist states by picking up 100 percent of the costs of expanded Medicaid coverage through 2017. The federal government would cover 95 percent of costs for 2018 and 2019, and 90 percent in the following years. • Health insurance exchanges would be created to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage. • Total out-of-pocket expenses would be limited, and insurance companies would be prevented from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history. • Individuals under Obama's plan would be required to purchase coverage or face a fine of up to $695 or 2.5 percent of income starting in 2016, whichever is greater. The House bill, in contrast, would have imposed a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. The Senate plan would have required a person to buy coverage or face a fine of up to $750 or 2 percent of his or her income. All three plans include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. • Companies with more than 50 employees under Obama's plan would be required to pay a fee of $2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company's workers receives federal health care subsidies. The first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation. As with the individual requirement, this represents a compromise between the House and Senate plans. • Some $40 billion in tax credits would be established for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees. • States could choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the health insurance exchanges. Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds. The White House is following the Senate's lead. The stricter House version banned abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies. •  Illegal immigrants would not be allowed to buy health insurance in the health insurance exchanges. They would be exempted from the individual insurance mandate. As with abortion, the White House is adopting the Senate's language.

25,"Washington (CNN) -- Health care reform advocates inched closer to victory Wednesday as a high-profile liberal Democrat switched his position and announced his intention to vote for a sweeping $875 billion plan under consideration in the House of Representatives. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said he believes ""health care is a civil right."" He had previously characterized the bill, which cleared the Senate in December, as little more than a boondoggle for private insurers. Kucinich was publicly lobbied for his vote by President Barack Obama during the president's visit this week to Kucinich's congressional district in Ohio. He told reporters he's had four meetings with Obama to discuss the bill. ""The president's visit to my district ... underscored the urgency of this vote,"" Kucinich said. ""I have doubts about the bill ... [but] I've decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation."" He said he ultimately had ""to make a decision on the bill as it is, not on the bill as I'd like to see it."" Kucinich is a backer of a single-payer health care system under which the government would fund all costs billed by doctors and hospitals. Kucinich's decision to change his vote is ""a good sign,"" Obama told reporters in the Oval Office. ""I told him thank you."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said she thought Kucinich's switch would make a difference with a large number of liberal activists. ""He's been a supporter of health care for all Americans for a long time,"" she said. ""He has a constituency, and many of those people still don't understand why there isn't a public [option]."" Pelosi has repeatedly expressed confidence that she will have enough support to pass the bill when it comes to the floor for a final vote. Read more about how votes are lining up . Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, indicated Wednesday the vote could come at some point this weekend. He said the leadership is still waiting for final cost estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on a package of changes to the measure. Asked if the release of the CBO numbers was imminent, Pelosi said, ""I would have said ... half an hour ago, hopefully any minute. I think it's going to take a little more time."" She said she had no explanation for the delay. ""I don't know the calculation,"" she said. ""I don't know how they do it. Whatever it is, they're the gospel and we have to live by it."" Later, Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami said that the CBO estimates would not be released Wednesday night. Since the Democrats have said the bill will be available for reading for 72 hours before a vote, the vote can take place no sooner than Sunday, provided the CBO numbers are posted Thursday. Pelosi needs 216 votes from her 253-member caucus to pass the Senate bill. No Republicans are expected to back it. A number of House Democrats have refused to state their voting intentions publicly. Twenty-seven House Democrats, however, have indicated they will join Republicans in opposing the Senate plan. That puts opponents of reform 11 votes shy of the 216 needed to prevent Obama from scoring a major victory on his top domestic priority. Meanwhile, GOP leaders continued to pound away at the legislation on Wednesday, slamming House Democratic leaders for considering the use of a controversial legislative maneuver to pass the Senate bill. Pelosi may try to help House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure. She is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply ""deem"" the Senate bill to be passed. The House then would proceed to a separate vote on the more popular package of changes to the Senate plan. ""I've never seen anything like the plan that House Democrats hatched this week to jam their health care bill through Congress,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Wednesday. ""Historians will remember this as a new low in this debate, the week that America was introduced to the 'scheme and deem' approach to legislating. They'll remember this as the week that Congress tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in order to get around their will."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Tuesday that Republicans will try to block the procedure. They will try to force a vote on a resolution requiring the Senate health care bill to be brought to an up-or-down vote. Boehner has called the maneuver -- also known as a ""self-executing rule"" -- the ""ultimate in Washington power grabs."" House Republicans sent a letter to the Democratic head of the House Rules Committee on Wednesday asking her to move an upcoming hearing on the health care bill to a larger room to account for overwhelming public interest in the issue. The committee is responsible for deciding whether the full House will have a chance to pass the Senate bill using the self-executing rule. ""While C-SPAN may decide to cover the hearing, that does not satisfy the need for the maximum amount of transparency and openness needed to give the American people faith in this process,"" the letter said. ""By moving the hearing to a larger room, we can ensure more Americans will have the opportunity to participate in our proceedings and not be turned away at the door."" Where does health care reform stand? If enacted, the Democratic reform proposal would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. The plan is expected to extend insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans. The Senate bill also would reduce federal deficits by about $118 billion over 10 years, according to CBO estimates. Top Republicans contend the plan amounts to an ill-conceived government takeover of the country's health care system. They have said it would do little to slow spiraling medical costs. They also argue it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle-class families while resulting in deep Medicare cuts. Public opinion polls indicate a majority of Americans have turned against the administration's health care reform plan, though individual elements of the proposal remain widely popular.

His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. Julian Zelizer says Medicare is a case of government playing a positive role in health care. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- Health care reform has gotten off track. The president's news conference fell flat. Polls show growing unease with the proposals currently in play. And Congress will not meet the deadline that President Obama imposed. The status quo, as the president correctly explained to reporters, is not sustainable. Our health care system is not working. Millions of people lack insurance, costs are out of control, businesses and workers are struggling to keep up with premiums, and there are tremendous inefficiencies plaguing many parts of the system. Conditions will only become worse in coming years. Our health care system brings to mind the economist Herbert Stein's famous maxim: ""When something can't go on forever, it will stop."" When Congress returns in September, Obama will only be able to revitalize the prospects for health care reform if he offers Americans a stronger argument about what government can do to improve this situation. After years of being in the opposition, Democrats are still scared about defending the value of government. Their political nerves have been exacerbated by polls showing the public is growing increasingly concerned about the size of government spending. This reticence about government, in the aftermath of the Democrats' dramatic 2008 election victory, has been one of the most striking aspects of the administration's rhetoric in the past few months. Before the 1970s, Democrats were full of confidence when pushing for federal programs. Indeed, 44 years ago this week, on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the legislation that created Medicare and Medicaid. The event took place at Harry Truman's presidential library in Independence, Missouri. Sitting beside the 81-year-old former president, Johnson announced: ""No longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years."" The program succeeded. Government worked. Before Medicare started, only about 50 percent of Americans who were 65 or older possessed hospital coverage. Within five years of the program's creation, 97 percent of the elderly had hospital coverage. The same changes occurred with physician's coverage. Today, more than 40 million elderly Americans rely on the program -- as do their families who don't have to take responsibility for these costs. Besides expanding coverage, Medicare has become instrumental to the health care industry. For all the complaints that we hear about Medicare, the reality is that most hospitals and doctors have come to depend on these federal payments into their system. Those who want to keep government ""out"" of the industry rarely acknowledge that government is already ""in."" While doctors were at the forefront of the campaign against Medicare, they turned out to be among the program's biggest beneficiaries. As political scientist Jonathan Oberlander told Slate about the industry, ""If they'd known how well they were going to do, they wouldn't have spent all those years opposing it. They would have said, 'Please pass this.' "" Medicare has also been able to accomplish the impossible: compel hospitals to change the way in which they charge for care. While policymakers had originally allowed hospitals to charge ""reasonable costs"" to the program, reforms in 1983 created the Prospective Payment System. Rather than paying hospitals for each patient they took care of, Medicare paid hospitals a fixed amount of money. The change resulted in significant cost reductions. Most recently, in Massachusetts, state policymakers have observed that the existence of a strong government program has created an opportunity to achieve such cost measures at the state level. And finally, Medicare has proven to be more popular than private insurance programs. So, for all the talk about hating big government, the big government seems to be doing something right, according to numerous polls. According to a Kaiser poll, 68 percent of respondents said they believed the Medicare program would put ""your interests above their own"" compared to 48 percent for private insurance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that more than 70 percent of Medicare fee-for-service recipients were satisfied with their access to care, in contrast to those on private insurance, where only 51 percent felt they could always obtain what they needed. Certainly, Medicare has been far from perfect. The program has not been good at innovation. When Congress added catastrophic medical coverage to Medicare in 1988, legislators were forced to retreat and repeal the plan in 1989 after encountering a political backlash. Congress added prescription drug benefits to Medicare, but not until 2003. Medicare has also become an enormously expensive part of the federal budget, requiring significant increases in payroll taxes while squeezing discretionary spending for other policies. All in all, however, Medicare has done pretty well for this country. It remains the best argument President Obama can make in response to his critics. Of course, arguments were not all that LBJ relied on. Johnson was willing to make key compromises on the legislation, such as originally allowing hospitals to determine charges and sitting back as Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills -- who had opposed the proposal for several years -- redrafted the measure in the final weeks and then publicly claimed credit for the outcome. Johnson was also willing to strong-arm members of his own party who were on the fence about the bill. But in the end, the key to Medicare was not politicking but a compelling belief that government could play a positive role in this country and in our health care system. As policymakers enter into the final rounds of this debate, they would do well to look carefully at the program that Lyndon Johnson signed into law in July 1965 and see just what Washington, despite all the knocks it takes, can provide.

27,"WASHINGTON -- For the second time since resigning the Alaska governorship more than a month ago, Sarah Palin is adding her voice to the fiery debate over health care. Sarah Palin says in a new op-ed that big government is not the solution to health care reform. This time, Palin is hitting the pages of the Wall Street Journal to counter President Obama's latest efforts to reform the nation's health care system. ""The answers offered by Democrats in Washington all rest on one principle: that increased government involvement can solve the problem. I fundamentally disagree,"" Palin writes in the 1,110-word opinion piece in Wednesday's edition of the paper. ""Common sense tells us that the government's attempts to solve large problems more often create new ones,"" the former Republican vice presidential candidate continues. ""Common sense also tells us that a top-down, one-size-fits-all plan will not improve the workings of a nationwide health-care system that accounts for one-sixth of our economy."" Palin, whose initial Facebook posting on ""death panels"" last month is credited with spurring heated opposition to the House Democratic health care proposal, again raises the claim -- now widely debunked -- that a government panel could determine which senior citizens receive vital treatments. ""Is it any wonder that many of the sick and elderly are concerned that the Democrats' proposals will ultimately lead to rationing of their health care by -- dare I say it -- death panels?"" she writes. ""Establishment voices dismissed that phrase, but it rang true for many Americans.""  Watch more on the health care debate » . Ultimately, Palin says, ""Congress will likely reject a wrong-headed proposal to authorize end-of-life counseling in this cost-cutting context"" because Americans made their voices heard in the contentious town halls last August. ""But the fact remains that the Democrats' proposals would still empower unelected bureaucrats to make decisions affecting life or death health-care matters. Such government overreaching is what we've come to expect from this administration,"" she says. Palin also takes issue with the president's assertion that Democrats' heath care proposals will rein in costs and eliminate waste and inefficiency in the system. Citing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Palin says currently proposed health care legislation will do little to bring down costs, but will instead cause the federal deficit to skyrocket by more than $200 billion over the next decade. ""Only in Washington could a plan that adds hundreds of billions to the deficit be hailed as a cost-cutting measure,"" writes Palin. Instead, Palin argues the true solution to health care lies in ""market oriented, patient-centered, and result driven"" measures such as providing tax benefits for those who get health care coverage from their jobs, providing seniors on Medicare vouchers to buy their own coverage, and allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines.",0.830345,6182
28,"San Diego, California (CNN)  -- There was a lot to appreciate in yesterday's bipartisan White House health care summit between President Obama and members of Congress. No really. This is the kind of thing that our leaders ought to do three or four times a year on a variety of issues -- from Social Security to education to immigration to job creation. Why not? Put aside the sound bites and partisan barbs. Get beyond the dueling appearances on the Sunday morning talk shows. And bring your best ideas and most constructive suggestions to the table. Obama deserves credit for convening the meeting. His opening remarks were good, especially when he talked about the rising costs of health insurance premiums, the ""exploding costs of Medicare and Medicaid,"" and how he wanted to ""make sure that this discussion is actually a discussion and not just us trading talking points."" I also appreciated  his candid discussion of health scares years ago involving his own daughters and how he wondered ""What would have happened if I didn't have reliable health care?"" And his acknowledgement that ""Everybody here understands the desperation that people feel when they're sick."" That is, assuming everything that happened yesterday at Blair House was real -- and not merely a theatrical setup for a Democratic-led effort next week to push through, using reconciliation, what Democrats on the Hill call ""the big bill."" That's Obama's comprehensive $950 billion plan to radically reform the nation's health care system -- the one opposed by every Republican in Congress and, according to polls, a majority of Americans. Reconciliation is a procedural maneuver that allows the Senate to pass the health care bill with 51 votes rather than the 60 votes required to end a filibuster. Yet, according to a recent Gallup poll, more than half of Americans -- 52 percent -- oppose Democrats resorting to reconciliation to pass a bill. And while Republicans are still holding out hope that Obama and congressional Democrats will go back to the drawing board and start with a blank piece of paper, that appears unlikely since Democrats seem to be ""all in"" on their piece of legislation. So what was the point of the summit? It might well have been to create a foil. According to what an unnamed Democratic official told Politico.com, the purpose of the event was to give a face to gridlock. Democrats intend over the next few weeks to spin this narrative suggesting that they tried, really tried, to work with Republicans but the ""party of no"" was just too obstinate and too uncompromising. So Democrats had no choice but to rely on the perfectly legitimate process known as reconciliation. So the summit was a fraud? A charade? I hope not. Even in Washington, there has to be a limit to cynicism. And I'd hope this would be it. I'd hope that Obama and Democratic lawmakers wouldn't toy with the American people on an issue as important as this one. Talk about broken government. The public wants solutions to our health care problems -- however they're defined -- and not partisan gimmicks that give ""a face to gridlock."" Even many of those Americans who oppose the Democratic plan turn around to tell pollsters, in the next breath, that the current system has too much cost and not enough common sense. No one approves of the status quo. That's at least something to agree on. And while Obama got a lot of things right in his remarks, he also made a big mistake when -- at the very outset of the discussion -- he defined as the baseline ""the House and the Senate legislation that's already passed."" That told Republicans that they were not getting their blank sheet of paper, and that the best they could hope for was to tweak but not substantially change the Democratic plans. It also did something else. It reminded the American people of who calls the shots in Washington. It's the party in power. Democrats control all the levers of government, at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Remember that fact. Write it down. For President Obama and the Democratic congressional leadership, the real obstacles to reform aren't Republicans -- who don't have any power -- but fellow Democrats who are up for re-election and who are terrified of ""the big bill."" They represent districts that either Obama lost to John McCain in 2008 or in which Obama barely squeaked out a victory. So they're not going anywhere near this unpopular piece of legislation. Who can blame them? Whatever happens on health care, Democrats alone deserve, depending on your view, either the credit or the blame. You see, the real face of gridlock is theirs.

29,"Washington (CNN)  -- The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to repeal the antitrust exemption currently granted to health insurance companies. The vote was 406-19 to repeal the exemption, which has been in place since the end of World War II. The 19 who voted against the repeal are Republicans. Liberal Democrats have said a repeal would help inject competition into the health care industry while reducing consumer costs. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters Tuesday that President Obama strongly supports the repeal. ""At its core, health reform is all about ensuring that American families and businesses have more choices, benefit from more competition and have greater control over their own health care,"" Gibbs said. Read the bill . ""Repealing this exemption is an important part of that effort. Gibbs said the president is not seeking repeal of the exemption in lieu of broader changes to the insurance market. ""This is a complementary step along the way,"" he said. The debate in the House on Wednesday included a colorful moment between Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, and Republicans. ""You guys have chutzpah,"" Weiner told Republicans during the debate. ""The Republican Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry,"" he said, drawing the objections of Republicans, who asked that his words be stricken from the record. Weiner then asked for unanimous consent to replace his words and said, ""Every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."" The Republicans objected again, prompting Weiner to rescind his words. The House version of the health care bill passed last year would have removed the antitrust exemption, while the Senate's version would not. Advocates of an exemption repeal say the exemption has allowed health insurance companies to essentially divide the country into geographic zones. They argue the companies benefit from what amounts to local monopolies. Industry defenders, in turn, point out that insurers are still subject to state regulations. They say the impact of an exemption repeal is overblown. CNN Fact Check: Would exemption repeal lower premiums? Administration officials and their allies in Congress have taken an increasingly tough stance against the unpopular insurance industry. Among other things, Obama's latest proposal for health care reform would give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate increases by health insurers. Specifically, Obama's plan calls for the secretary of health and human services to work with a seven-member board made up of doctors, economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium increases. The board, to be known as the Health Insurance Rate Authority, would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved, although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators.",0.8280522,9308
30,"(CNN) -- President Obama introduced a health care plan that he says will bridge the gap between the House and Senate bills passed last year. His proposal is similar to the Senate bill, with a few nods to the House plan. Here are some of the highlights of his plan, according to the White House. Basics . The president says his health care proposal will help more than 31 million uninsured Americans get coverage. Obama says his plan includes the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history. It establishes a health insurance market that would provide the same insurance choices that members of Congress have. Health insurance exchanges, as proposed in the Senate bill, would be created to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed to purchase less expensive coverage. There is no public option, an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed both by Republicans and key Democratic moderates. Like the House and Senate plans, Obama's proposal would bar insurers from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history or denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Key differences . Obama's plan eliminates the controversial proposal added to the Senate bill that exempts Nebraska from paying increased Medicaid expenses. It also provides additional federal financing to all of the states for the Medicaid expansion. The president's proposal closes the Medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole."" Under current Medicare limits, seniors must pick up the costs once their drug costs reach $2,830 and pay all costs out of pocket until they reach $4,550, at which point Medicare coverage kicks back in. Obama's proposal eases the ""doughnut hole"" in the short term by providing a $250 rebate to Medicare beneficiaries who reach the limit in 2010. The plan closes the doughnut hole completely by 2020. The plan also establishes a Health Insurance Rate Authority to provide an additional level of oversight of insurance premium increase at the federal level, giving the government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies. Tax credits . The president's proposal increases federal subsidies to help people buy insurance. New health insurance subsidies would be provided to families making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Compared to the Senate bill, Obama's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $44,000 and $66,000, according to the White House. Compared to the House bill, it lowers premiums for families making between $55,000 and $88,000. Obama's plan also provides more cost-sharing assistance than the House and Senate bills for families with incomes below $55,000. For families making about $55,000, the president's proposal matches the assistance in the Senate bill. Penalties and fees . The House and Senate bills both require payments from individuals who choose not to get health care coverage. Obama's plan lowers the maximum penalty for individuals. Obama's plan also provides $40 billion in tax credits for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees. Like the Senate bill, the president's proposal does not mandate that employers provide insurance. Under Obama's plan, companies with more than 50 employees would be required to pay a fee of $2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company's workers receives federal health care subsidies. The first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation. As with the individual requirement, this represents a compromise between the House and Senate plans. Obama's proposal delays the $67 billion assessment on health insurers, pushing it to 2014, when exchanges and the new health insurance market will be set up. The president's proposal also increases the revenue drawn from the pharmaceutical industry to $23 billion over the next three years -- $10 billion more than the Senate bill. It delays the implementation of these fees to 2011. Waste, fraud and abuse . The president's proposal includes a number of provisions to help eliminate waste and fight fraud. Some of those provisions include establishing Medicare and Medicaid sanctions databases, increasing access to the health care integrity and protection data bank, expanding efforts to recover overpayments made to providers and suppliers, and establishing a system to more quickly identify potentially fraudulent payments. Obama's proposal also calls for preventing delays in access to generic drugs. Questions . The president's proposal doesn't address many of the sticking points that hung up the House and Senate bills. Obama says his plan also reduces the deficit by $100 billion over the next decade and about $1 trillion over the following decade by ""cutting government overspending and reining in waste, fraud and abuse."" The White House says the plan would cost about $950 billion over the next 10 years, but that's not an official estimate. There are also not a lot of specifics on how to pay for the plan. The Senate plan, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, would cost an estimated $871 billion; the more expansive House plan has been estimated to cost over $1 trillion. The Obama plan resembles the Senate version on how to block subsidies from funding abortions, choosing it over the more conservative House version. On health care and illegal immigrants, the president's proposal follows the Senate language, which imposes far more limits on undocumented workers than the House version. Outlook . Obama's proposal is a long way from becoming law. His proposal would need to be drafted into legislation, debated and passed by the House and Senate. As the past year has shown, health care is an emotional subject, and debate can drag on for months. Immediate reaction from Republicans suggests that this time around, it won't be any easier. ""Nearly one year ago, the president moderated a health care summit that kicked off a national debate that has led us to where we are today: a partisan bill devoid of support from the American people and a diminished faith in this government's capacity to listen. Let's not make the same mistake twice,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said. House Minority Leader John Boehner revived the abortion debate, saying, ""Republicans are also standing with the American people by calling for health care reform to protect human life and not use taxpayer money to fund abortion. ... Health care reform should be an opportunity to protect human life -- not end it -- and the American people agree.""

31,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democrats unveiled their revised version of health care reform Tuesday, offering a proposal that includes a government-funded health insurance option, requires both individuals and employers to participate, and taxes the wealthy to help cover costs. President Obama has urged Congress to work quickly on creating a health care reform bill. Democratic House leaders said the measure, titled ""America's Affordable Health Choices Act,"" met the requirements set by President Obama for health care reform by lowering costs to consumers and businesses, letting people keep their current plan if desired, and preventing denial of coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions. ""The House proposal will begin the process of fixing what's broken about our health care system, reducing costs for all, building on what works, and covering an estimated 97 percent of all Americans,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""And by emphasizing prevention and wellness, it will also help improve the quality of health care for every American."" Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, said the bill is intended to repair a ""dysfunctional"" health care system that is draining the U.S. economy while leaving 46 million Americans without health insurance. ""We are going to accomplish what many people felt wouldn't happen in our lifetime,"" he said. But House Republicans slammed the Democrats' bill and pledged to try to amend it as three House committees begin considering the legislation later this week. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said the bill ""without any question will kill jobs, will limit access to health care, will raise taxes and will lead to a government takeover of health care."" Blunt said he will offer an amendment requiring all elected federal officials, including Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, to enroll in the new public insurance option. Republicans and some fiscally conservative Democrats also question the cost of health care reform. An earlier draft of the House Democrats' bill carried a price tag of $1 trillion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office said the revised house bill also would cost $1 trillion. However, a senior Democratic House committee staffer said the CBO analysis only covered costs without factoring in cost-saving measures worth $500 billion over 10 years or the revenue from tax surcharges on wealthy Americans, estimated to raise more than $500 billion over a decade. According to the CBO, the bill would cover 97 percent of Americans by 2015. The bill includes tax surcharges on Americans in the top 1.2 percent of income. It proposes a 5.4 percent surtax on couples earning more than $1 million, a 1.5 percent surtax on couples with income between $500,000 and $1 million, and a 1 percent surtax on joint incomes over $350,000 or individual income over $280,000. Anticipating Republican complaints that the tax surcharges would harm small business owners who report their income as personal, Democratic sponsors said the measure would affect less than 5 percent of all small business owners. Specific provisions of the bill include: . -- A Health Insurance Exchange providing individuals and small business with choices for coverage, including a government-funded public option. -- No more coverage exclusion for pre-existing conditions. -- Affordability credits for low- and moderate-income individuals and families, available to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $43,000 for individuals and $88,000 for a family of four. -- Limits on annual out-of-pocket spending. -- Expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals and families with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. -- Required participation by individuals, with a penalty of 2.5 percent of adjusted gross income for non-compliance. -- Requirement that businesses with payrolls exceeding $250,000 provide their employees with health coverage or contribute up to 8 percent of their payroll on their behalf. -- A series of measures intended to reduce costs of Medicaid, Medicare and other existing systems. A statement Tuesday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups opposed some of the bill's proposals, calling for market forces and employer autonomy instead of mandated participation by businesses. ""Exempting some micro-businesses will not prevent this provision from killing many jobs,"" the statement said. The House bill now goes to three committees for debate and revision before consideration by the full chamber. The Senate also is considering health reform measures that contain some of the House bill provisions. Obama has said he wants both chambers to pass their respective proposals before Congress goes on its August recess as part of a timetable to get a final bill to his desk by the end of the year. House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia argued that the current economic conditions mean Congress should take its time on a major overhaul of the health care system. ""There's no need for us to be rushing into passing legislation before the end of this month at the potential cost of, really, millions of jobs,"" Cantor said Tuesday. A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found that a slim majority -- 51 percent -- support Obama's health care plans, but most worry that their costs would go up, and only one in five think their families would be better off.

32,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama claimed the second major legislative victory of his young administration Wednesday, signing a bill to provide federally funded health care to an estimated 4 million children. President Obama says the SCHIP bill is a downpayment on his ""commitment to cover every single American.""

With the bill, Obama said at a White House ceremony, ""We fulfill one of the highest responsibilities that we have -- to ensure the health and well-being of our nation's children."" The president said the bill was a downpayment on his ""commitment to cover every single American."" The SCHIP expansion is Obama's second major legislative win in less than a week.

Bush vetoed two similar health care bills in 2007, arguing that the legislation would encourage families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Before the bill's passage, SCHIP covered almost 7 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who can't afford private insurance. The new law boosts total SCHIP funding to approximately $60 billion. The expanded program will be financed with a 62-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.

""We're not going to tolerate any demonstrations or any booing,"" he said after one audience member shoved another making an unsolicited speech. ""So it's up to you.""  Watch the shouting and shoving » . Many in the crowd identified themselves as conservative Republicans, with one man noting they had voted for Specter before the senator switched parties this year. One woman prompted a standing ovation by telling Specter: ""I don't believe this is just health care. This is about the systematic dismantling of this country. ... I don't want this country turning into Russia, turning into a socialized country. What are you going to do to restore this country back to what our founders created, according to the Constitution?""  See a comparison of different countries' plans » . Specter responded by noting his support for the Constitution as a past chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on issues such as warrantless wiretaps. ""When you ask me to defend the Constitution, that's what I've been doing,"" Specter said. Specter said that overhauling the health care system is about America taking care of all of its people. ""In our social contract, we have provisions that see to it that you take care of people who need some help,"" he said. Several people asked if a health care bill would mean taxpayer dollars would pay for others to get abortions. Specter responded that any measure passed by Congress would allow people to choose a plan that didn't cover abortions. The senator agreed with the crowd on some issues, saying he opposes mandatory counseling on end-of-life issues called for in a House of Representatives version of health care legislation. Specter also vowed he would never support any bill that increased the federal deficit or took away a person's right to choose their health care coverage. ""I am opposed to anybody making a decision for you or me or anybody else about what health care plan we should have,"" he said. Emotions ran high, with questioners complaining of government intrusion in their lives on health care and other issues. One man implored Specter and the government to ""leave us alone,"" while another said the message Specter should take back to Washington is that he and others ""want our country back."" The shoving incident occurred early in the 90-minute session when a man started shouting that he had been told by Specter's staff that he could speak, but he didn't get one of the 30 cards distributed to people allowing them to ask questions. Another man stood up and shoved the protester, and Specter approached the men shouting for calm. ""You and your cronies in government do this kind of stuff all the time,"" the protester shouted before leaving the hall. ""I'm not a lobbyist with all kinds of money to stuff in your pockets. I'll leave you so you can do whatever the hell you do."" Specter remained calm most of the time, except when a woman asked if the bill meant a 74-year-old man with cancer would be written off by an overhauled health care system. ""Nobody 74 is going to be written off because they have cancer,"" he responded angrily. ""That's a vicious, untrue rumor.""  See an overview of the issue » . One man defended the rowdy behavior of the audience. ""I don't think we have bad attitudes,"" he said. ""We're just being Americans."" iReport.com: Attending a town hall? Specter said he would vote against all the provisions he said he opposed in the town hall meeting, but he dodged the question of whether he would vote against a final bill if it still contained those provisions. The senator also tried to inject some humor, making sure to thank the lone person among the 30 questioners who supported the health care overhaul. Obama has said an overhaul is essential for long-term economic stability. Congressional action has slowed due to strong Republican opposition. Neither the House nor the Senate met Obama's goal of passing a bill before Congress' August recess.  Watch how Obama is preparing for his own town hall » .

36,"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and Chief National Correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Joe Ray, left, says the cost of providing full-time workers with health care is worth it. PORTLAND, Maine (CNN) -- Joe Ray has no complaints about the economy but plenty of worries about what he sees and hears in Washington. His company, Free Range Fish & Lobster, processes 8 million pounds of fish a year, plus shellfish and lobsters. A recession means restaurant sales are down some, but that decline is more than offset by the surge in people looking for seafood as they eat more meals at home. ""We're up about 30 percent,"" Ray said during a tour of the operation along the Portland waterfront. He says the cost of providing full-time workers with health care is expensive but worth it. ""To keep good employees,"" he said. ""So you don't have to keep changing the flow of people that are coming in and out. It costs money to do that, too."" But when it comes to the debate over national health care reform, Ray sees the price as out of line with what the country can afford right now.  Watch CNN's John King preview Sunday's show from a dock in Maine » . ""I think I'd rather just be left alone,"" Ray said. ""Just pay my bill and try to deal with it that way."" A fiscal conservative, he has a simple view of President Obama. ""Right now, he is just spending, spending, spending, and I just hope it helps the country,"" Ray says. Paul Hogan is on the other end of the country's health care tug-of-war . ""It is just a crazy system, and it needs to be fixed,"" said Hogan, a retired attorney who held a party at his Kennebunkport home Wednesday evening to watch Obama's speech to Congress. He posted notice of his viewing party on the Obama political organization Web site but in the end watched the speech with a half-dozen friends and neighbors. No strangers signed up, as was common at such events during the Web-driven Obama presidential campaign. ""I think it is much harder to get people involved in an issue,"" Hogan said. ""I think there are lots of people who will get involved every two years or every four years and will talk to their neighbors for elections."" Maine is an interesting stage in the health care debate for a number of reasons. Consider just these two: . • The decline in support for Obama's handling of health care has been pronounced among Americans who consider themselves political independents, and in Maine, nearly four out of every 10 voters is ""unenrolled"" or independent of any political party. In the latest CNN polling, for example, 45 percent of all Americans disapproved of how Obama is handling his job as president. Among independents, his disapproval rating was 53 percent. And specifically on health care, 44 percent of all Americans approve of Obama's handling of the health care issue, while 53 percent disapprove. Among independents, only 33 percent approve of the president's handling of health care, while 61 percent disapprove. • Maine's two U.S. senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, are among the handful of realistic Republican targets as the White House tries to get at least modest GOP support. Snowe, in particular, has a crucial voice at the moment because of her seat on the Senate Finance Committee. We visited Snowe's Portland office the morning after the president's speech, and it was clear that she was getting mixed advice. ""No gov't h c.,"" an office worker scribbled on a legal pad as she took one of the dozens of morning calls. ""Supp Publ Opt,"" is another notation made during a call a few minutes later, shorthand for supporting the public option that Obama and most Democrats would prefer to compete with private insurers. Snowe is skeptical of the public option and has been trying to negotiate an alternative with the White House and colleagues on the Finance Committee. Collins, usually described as slightly more conservative than Snowe, is even more skeptical of such an expanded government role. In the end, though, those who know the state's independent politics well say that both senators have a lot of leeway despite the high stakes and high emotions of the health care debate. ""Generally, what people in Maine vote for is what works"" is how Angus King, who was elected to two terms as governor as an independent, describes the state's less ideological politics. ""I would call it pragmatism. ... They seem more interested in getting things done than necessarily lining up in a partisan way."" Speaking specifically of Snowe and her prominent role at the moment in health care talks, King said, ""She is the winningest politician in Maine history. She is enormously popular, and I think she can do whatever she wants."" The former governor says that because independents are by definition a varied group, he sees no one reason Obama's standing among these voters on the health care issue has dropped. For some it is probably worries about the costs; others perhaps are disappointed the president has not had more early success delivering on his promise to change Washington. ""I think people are going to say, 'OK, what's working and what's happening down there?' "" said King, an Obama supporter. ""This health care thing is very important. Not only important substantively but symbolically. ""Can he lead? Can he put something across the line? Is he tough enough?""",0.81108457,8632
37,"(CNN) -- With his push for health care reform on the line, the president delivered a message of urgency to the public: . President Bill Clinton, pictured in 1994, greets members of a crowd following a speech on his health care reform plan. ""Don't let the fearmongers, don't let the dividers, don't let the people who disseminate false information frighten the United States Congress into walking away from the opportunity of a lifetime. Tell the members of Congress you will support them. This is not partisan politics,"" the president said. The date was August 1, 1994, and the voice behind the 11th-hour battle cry was then-President Clinton. Within weeks, that battle cry was reduced to a whimper of defeat as Congress tabled plans to vote on his legislation. As President Obama ratchets up the pressure on Congress to pass health care reform this year, he's following in the footsteps of the 42nd president. From his prime time push to his town hall meetings, Obama is taking the same path as Clinton, but hoping for a different ending. Clinton and Obama faced similar climates. Both made health care their signature issue, even though most people were happy with their coverage and were more concerned with fixing the economy. Clinton presented Congress with a plan, whereas Obama instead presented broad guidelines and asked the lawmakers to come up with a bill. ""Much of the complaint about the Clinton-era attempt at this was how complicated it was,"" said Candy Crowley, CNN's senior political correspondent. ""That has not been a complaint this time. But in the overview, there was no doubt that the steady drumbeat of criticism started out at a fairly low level and just has come to this deafening roar, and that's very much like it was in the resistance to the Clinton plan."" Like Clinton, Obama's been accused of waffling on his proposals and failing to reach across the aisle. Following weeks of contentious town hall meetings, Obama this weekend appeared more flexible than ever on the idea of a government-sponsored, public health insurance option. Liberal Democrats have demanded a public option, but some conservatives call such a proposal a deal breaker. Obama has voiced his support for the public option but stopped short of calling it a necessity. At a town hall in Colorado this weekend, however, he called it ""just one sliver"" of reform. ""The public option, whether we have it or we don't have it, is not the entirety of health care reform,"" he said. The White House was quick to insist that the administration's stance has not changed, and sent talking points to congressional Democrats trying to ease concern about the public option. The administration has been ""boringly consistent"" on the issue, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday.  Watch: Is the White House changing its message? » . Clinton was accused of backtracking after he seemed to back down from his stated goal of universal coverage at a 1994 National Governors' Association conference. Democrats protested and the White House insisted that the president's words were misinterpreted. But those reading the tea leaves knew the effort was losing steam. Some Democrats distanced themselves from the president as the 1994 midterm elections neared. Clinton and other key Democrats tried to compromise with a scaled-down version of the president's original plan, but the effort unraveled and eventually faded from the agenda. ""It's the art of dealmaking, and it's not surprising that they would both face this. In the face of huge outcry, presidents or politicians look for a compromise,"" Crowley said. ""When you see the possibility that it could go down in flames, you look for ways to appease the critics of it, and both Clinton, and now it appears Obama, are trying to do that -- to find some way to pass something."" When Congress reconvenes after the August recess, lawmakers will return to a different climate on Capitol Hill, kindled by the protests of those who have been questioning Obama's proposals. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, said last month that if Republicans can stop Obama on health care, ""it will be his Waterloo."" Clinton's agenda was bruised following his health care defeat, but it was his party that was dealt the hardest hits. The Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. It took another 12 years to get it back. Mary Matalin, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, predicted a repeat of history for Obama, should health care fail. ""What is right about conventional wisdom is, he'll be fine, but the Democrats in Congress won't,"" she said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""And you are already hearing Democrats in Congress saying, 'This is deja vu. This is what happened with Bill Clinton. He makes us walk the plank, then we lose,' as they did,"" she said. Clinton acknowledged the political importance of a health care win in his speech before the Netroots Nation convention last week. Passing comprehensive health care legislation, he said, ""is not only the morally right thing to do. It is politically imperative for the Democrats to pass a health care bill now, because one thing we know and that I have lived through is that if you get out there and then you don't prevail, the victors get to rewrite history."" Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville said that since it's clear that Senate Democrats don't have the 60 votes needed to get a full Senate vote, they should instead force Republicans to filibuster the bill. ""Then, you say, 'They're the people that stopped it. We had a majority of Democrats. We had a good bill. They stopped it,' "" said Carville, a former adviser to Clinton. Republicans under the Clinton administration threatened to filibuster, but the warnings proved inconsequential, as the bill never got that far. As health care reaches a turning point for Obama, ""timing is everything,"" Crowley said. ""It's not an election year -- yet. To me, that works on Obama's side, where it didn't with Clinton because the minute it becomes an election year, it's just different, because congressmen, senators are looking at what their constituents are saying back home, and their jobs are on the line,"" Crowley said. But that safety net won't hold for long, and Obama has only a few more months to show whether history will repeat itself or be rewritten. ""I think the time is critical for President Obama because at the end of the year, Congress goes off and takes a recess ... and so you end up having a pretty narrow time frame, and then when they come back in January -- guess what, it's an election year,"" Crowley said.",0.81063205,6555

Gloria Borger says we could be in for a month of venting sessions aimed at members of Congress. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ah, the summer. Time for all those members of Congress to go home, meet with their constituents, get their input on health care reform and take back what they have learned from the voters. Not exactly. In some town hall meetings around the country, anger and fear are trumping any constructive argument -- at least so far. Recently, for instance, Sen. Arlen Specter held a town hall meeting with Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary. In attempting to answer questions, they were shouted down by folks more interested in venting than discussing. On the conservative FreedomWorks Web site, the display was headlined ""Specter Gets Schooled."" Above the video of the event, the site says ""... this is a must watch and a must emulate at town halls across the country over the next month."" Really? What about those folks who are actually interested in debating and discussing a very complex issue they're trying to digest? There are some who may actually want to figure out the best way to solve the health care problem. What ever happened to asking questions about the quality of care, the cost of insurance, the impact of any public plan on the health care system? After all, this has been a turbulent economic time for this country, and another huge shock to the system is naturally worrisome. Especially when it comes to an issue as complex as health care. But it's not just the folks at these town halls who have learned how to heckle. Their bad behavior is a derivative of the questionable quality of the political debate they listen to every day. Indeed, if there's one thing we've gotten really good at over the years, it's this: reducing complicated problems to bite-sized slogans. It seems to work, so we keep doing it. Ipso facto, Obama's reform ideas become ""socialism"" to his Republican critics. And the administration is not above creating a handy bogeyman of its own: the insurance companies. At least according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who accuses them of ""full-force carpet-bombing and shock and awe against the public option."" Too bad they actually support the rest of reform, and are still running positive ads about the effort. They weren't at the table at all 16 years ago when Hillary Clinton's effort at reform failed. The world has changed since then, and the congressional plans for reforming health care have changed, too. But the invective of the debate, sad to say, has not. The effort on Capitol Hill has been serious. I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but members of Congress are actually doing some real work. Some policy differences may never get resolved because they are too ideological; others are regional, and that's tough, too. But they're working at it, for hours on end, behind closed doors. No cameras, no grandstanding. One of those working the hardest, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, was derided at a town hall recently on the matter of his own health insurance. So here's the fellow who is spending every waking hour trying to get a bipartisan measure that can pass the Senate -- and be fair to Iowans -- and he goes home and gets an earful. Maybe the discourse will become more productive as the summer progresses. And maybe not. But the health care dilemma remains, no matter how loud the discussion. As John F.

39,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A key House committee passed comprehensive health care reform legislation Friday, moving President Obama's domestic priority one step closer to congressional approval. Speaker Nancy Pelosi says House Democrats will return to their districts ready to defend the bill. The vote occurred as the House of Representatives adjourned for its August recess. The 31-28 vote in the House Energy and Commerce Committee came after several days of intense and often contentious negotiations between Democratic House leaders and an influential group of fiscal conservatives in the party. Three members of the Democrats' conservative Blue Dog caucus -- John Barrow of Georgia, Jim Matheson of Utah and Charlie Melancon of Louisiana -- voted against the bill, along with two other Democrats, Bart Stupak of Michigan and Rick Boucher of Virginia. The committee's bill will now be merged with two separate versions passed by other House panels before being considered by the full chamber in September. The prospects for health care reform in the full House, however, remain unclear. Democrats remain deeply divided, with a number of liberals expressing strong opposition to concessions made to the party's so-called Blue Dog conservatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee. The fate of health care reform also remains uncertain in the Senate, where the Finance Committee recently postponed its long-awaited vote on a bipartisan compromise plan until after the August recess. The coming fights in both chambers serve as a backdrop for what is expected to be a month of furious campaigning for and against the bill as members of Congress meet with constituents back home over the break. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that House Democrats will return to their districts with talking points and memos to help them rebut opponents running ""a shock and awe campaign ... to perpetuate the status quo."" ""Facts mean nothing"" to insurance industry executives and others opposed to change, she said. ""Misrepresentation is the currency of their realm."" Pelosi did not indicate, however, how Democratic divisions in the House might be overcome when Congress returns in the fall. On Thursday, 57 members of the House Progressive Caucus sent a letter to Pelosi and others complaining that the agreement with the Blue Dogs weakened language creating a government-funded health insurance option. ""Any bill that does not provide, at a minimum, for a public option with reimbursement rates based on Medicare rates -- not negotiated rates -- is unacceptable,"" the letter said. The revised bill calls for the government-run public insurance option to be reimbursed on rates determined by negotiations with the insurance industry. The original version called for the same reimbursement rates as in the government's Medicare program for senior citizens. The progressive Democrats also argued that cuts to the bill's overall price would shortchange subsidies meant to help low- and moderate-income Americans buy health insurance. Some of those concerns were addressed Friday when the Energy and Commerce committee boosted funding for subsidies and added a provision empowering the federal government to directly negotiate prescription drug rates in the public plan. The agreement with the Blue Dogs, estimated to lower the cost of the House plan by $100 billion over a decade, would also exempt businesses with payrolls below $500,000 from having to provide health coverage to employees. ""We can compromise no more,"" warned Rep. Lynn Woolsey, co-chair of the 81-member Progressive Caucus. ""When leaders of the House meet ... to consider the three bills and produce a final one, we expect that it will retain a robust public option. If it doesn't, we will vote against it."" Opposition from progressive Democrats and some conservative House Democrats who want additional cost cuts could defeat the bill. Pelosi admitted that she preferred the original bill, but noted that much of the new language matched a proposal supported by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, a longtime champion of health care reform who is revered by liberal Democrats. She also pointed out that the bill could change when the House and Senate negotiate a final measure in coming months. On the Senate side, key Republicans in the Finance Committee negotiations said Wednesday that they were unlikely to complete work on a compromise plan before the August break. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Michael Enzi of Wyoming said too many issues remained unresolved to sign on to a deal by the time the Senate breaks for its recess on August 7. On Thursday, Grassley said pressure from the White House and Democratic leaders to speed the process didn't help. ""It would be better for me to say that instead of saying there's no way we can cut a deal, there's no way we can get all the compromising that needs to be done by an artificial deadline of Friday of this week,"" Grassley said. ""So we're going to continue to work together this week and next week. But we're getting close."" Democrats had hoped the Finance Committee could finish its work before the August break to show progress toward health legislation.

40,"Washington (CNN) -- Democratic congressional leaders unveiled a long-awaited $940 billion compromise health care plan Thursday, setting the stage for a final legislative showdown on President Obama's domestic priority. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced that Obama had decided to delay an upcoming trip to Australia and Indonesia to help push the bill over the finish line. The president had been set to depart Washington on Sunday, the same day that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the measure. Watch Gibbs defend health plan maneuver . ""I'm sure he wants to be here for the history,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. If enacted, the measure would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. It would extend insurance coverage to an additional 32 million Americans, according to a preliminary analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Among other things, the plan would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance, and ban denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions. It seeks to bridge the gap between previous House and Senate bills partly by watering down and delaying the implementation of a tax on high-end insurance plans. As with earlier House and Senate plans, it includes significant reductions in Medicare spending, in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program. It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill that exempts Nebraska from paying increased Medicaid expenses. The compromise plan would cut the nation's deficit by $138 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It would further reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion in the following decade. The full House is now tentatively set to consider two measures Sunday: the $875 billion plan passed by the Senate in December and the compromise, which would bring the total to $940 billion. The compromise plan cannot become law if the Senate bill is not also enacted. If the Senate bill passes, it would go to Obama to be signed into law. If the revisions unveiled Thursday are also approved, they would still have to clear the Senate. House members unhappy with the less expansive Senate bill have received assurances from top Senate Democrats that they will pass the $940 billion compromise. House Democrats pushed hard to ensure the compromise included an expansion of subsidies to low- and middle-income families, as well as a reduction in the tax on high-end ""Cadillac"" plans. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, told reporters Thursday that the budget office's cost estimate ""will go a long way to get [fiscally conservative Democrats] to feel comfortable with the legislation."" The Senate bill, if allowed to stand unchanged, would reduce federal deficits by $20 billion less than the compromise plan over the next 10 years. GOP leaders said the new budget office estimate of the revised plan had not changed their opinion of the overall measure, which they vehemently oppose. ""It's not too late for the American people to continue to speak up,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday. ""They need to yell a little louder, and we can stop this."" Republicans insist the Democratic proposal will do little to slow spiraling medical costs. They also say it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle-class families while resulting in deep Medicare cuts. Pelosi has nevertheless expressed confidence in recent weeks that she will have enough support to pass both the Senate plan and the compromise bill when they come to the House floor. The speaker needs 216 votes from her 253-member caucus to pass the measures. No Republicans are expected to back either one. Watch Pelosi express her confidence in the plan . Twenty-seven House Democrats indicated to CNN on Wednesday they will join Republicans in opposing the Senate plan. That leaves opponents of reform 11 votes shy of defeating the measure. Pelosi has tried to sweeten the deal for House liberals by adding a large student loan reform measure to the compromise plan. The measure, which is a priority for Obama, would end the practice of having private banks offer student loans while expanding direct lending from the government. The speaker may also try to help House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure. She is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply ""deem"" the Senate bill to be passed. The House then would proceed to a separate vote on the changes incorporated in the $940 billion version of the plan. Read about the highlights of the compromise plan . Republicans failed Thursday to force a vote on a resolution requiring the Senate health care bill to be brought to an up-or-down vote. GOP leaders are also fuming over Democrats' decision to use a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which will allow the $940 billion plan -- if passed by the House -- to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. Senate Democrats lost their filibuster-proof 60-seat supermajority in January with the election of GOP Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts. Republicans say that reconciliation, which is limited to provisions pertaining to the budget, was never meant to facilitate passage of a sweeping reform measure such as the health care bill. Democrats say that reconciliation was used to pass several major bills in recent years, including President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Public opinion polls indicate that Americans remain sharply divided over the Democrats' health care reform agenda, though individual elements of it remain widely popular.

41,"(CNN) -- The health care bill's passage has struck such an emotional chord that more than 10,000 people have posted comments and sometimes deeply personal stories about it on CNN.com. Under the bill, which President Obama is expected to sign Tuesday at the earliest, most Americans will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine. Larger employers will be required to provide coverage or risk financial penalties. Total individual out-of-pocket expenses will be capped, and insurers will be barred from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions. Democrat Alison Victoria, who was a financial manager at a hospital for 15 years, supported the bill. As it's written, the bill ""isn't perfect, and it's not everything I wanted, but it will save lives,"" Victoria said in an iReport video. ""Doctors, nurses and financial officers see a part of our health care system that many Americans don't, if they're lucky,"" she said. ""We have seen benefits denied based on false allegations that the treatment is not medically necessary. We have seen families and whole small businesses dropped from insurance coverage because one person on the plan got sick. We have seen people unable to find insurance because of a pre-existing condition,"" she said, likening the bill to a form of ""justice"" promised in the Constitution. See complete coverage of the health care bill . Another reader used sarcasm to suggest that people will find a way around paying premiums. ""This is cool. I'm just going to drop my insurance now, pay the $700 yearly fine, and then pickup insurance when I get sick since insurance companies can't deny me,"" he wrote on the Sound Off section of a CNN.com news story published after the bill passed. ""I'll save a bundle of money every year."" ""I suspect this is what most 'smart' Americans will do,"" he continued. ""And then guess what? Insurance companies will collapse because they'll have no pool of money to pay for the claims that start coming in, and we'll be in a world of hurt again."" What will health care reform mean to you? Many people who responded to CNN's coverage said they were happy the bill passed simply because the current system was not working. Government-backed health care is ""the best compromise possible,"" Egberto Willies said. He's relieved that his wife, who has lupus, and his daughter, a pre-med student, won't have to worry about health care as much under the new bill, he said. ""America has joined the civilized world,"" he said in his iReport video. iReporter Cameron Harrelson, however, said he is afraid that his generation will end up paying for the bill. ""We're going to have to endure it the longest,"" the 15-year-old from Georgia said. Cliff Olney's daughter was born premature, and he's had to spend more than two decades caring for her with Medicaid, the U.S. health program funded by state and federal governments available to low-income people or people with disabilities. ""After 22 years of fighting health insurance companies, me and my daughter have vindication,"" he told iReport. But he also thinks the fight is far from over. ""You know what's going to happen now ... the insurance companies will begin to cut people who are sick as quickly as they can before the window of opportunity is over ... they'll also increase premiums as the banks did after legislation was passed for credit card reform."" Michael Ingram, of Milford, Pennsylvania, says he's in good health and feels like he doesn't need health insurance. As a Navy veteran, he goes to a Veterans Affairs hospital when he's ill, he said. ""Forcing me to take a health care package that I may not need is dictatorial and not in keeping with the spirit or a free nation,"" Ingram wrote in his iReport. He said he's written to his representatives about the bill and said both parties are a ""sham."" He plans to refuse to buy a health care plan. ""I hope that everyone can give this [health care bill] a chance,"" wrote one CNN.com reader who identified herself as a 27-year-old recent college graduate who is working full time for a law firm and has health insurance through her job. Two years ago, she was diagnosed with two debilitating diseases that require chemotherapy twice a week and 19 prescription drugs at a cost of $660 a month after insurance, she said. She and her husband, who doesn't have health insurance because it would cost $1,000 extra to add him to her plan, feel like they can barely keep their heads above water. ""The hardest thing for me, is that I know he has medical issues that go unattended because we simply can't afford it,"" she wrote.

42,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- While a government-run public health care option irks conservatives, and even some fiscally minded Democrats, the idea of health care cooperatives has emerged as an option in the reform debate. Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad, of North Dakota, says a public option plan might not make it through Congress. Small health care cooperatives have worked in a couple of markets. But whether the idea can be applied on a national scale is debatable. Sen. Kent Conrad, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is pushing the co-op idea as an alternative to a government-sponsored insurance program that would compete with private insurers. He doesn't think a government option will pass in the Senate. Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday that his model could attract 12 million members and ""be the third-largest insurer in the country and be a very effective competitor [with private insurance companies]."" ""If you believe competition helps drive down costs, then they would certainly contribute to holding down costs,"" Conrad said. But Tim Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University, said that Conrad is not offering concrete statistics on how the plan will help reform health care. ""I have not seen anything, other than Sen. Conrad's statements to the press, explaining how this is going to work,"" he said. ""He put out a couple of one-pagers early on, but he is talking about this actuarial data. Let's make it public, let's find out who the actuaries are."" Co-ops are nonprofit organizations that aim to provide better coverage at a lower cost for their members. They put profits back into the system, so any money that is earned is used on patients and other costs. In addition, patients elect a governing board. Cooperatives are already established in cities such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Seattle, Washington. In order for a co-op to have reduced costs, analysts say, it needs to have tens of thousands of members. That could be a hard slog for the nonprofits because start-up costs would probably be in the millions. That may be where the federal government steps in -- by adding seed money for the program. That government infusion of money probably would put Democrats at odds with Republicans, who are worried about the rising federal deficit and an expanded role of government in health care.  Watch two members of the House discuss reform » . And the costs of a cooperative might not allow enough people to sign up, meaning that some of the nearly 46 million uninsured Americans wouldn't be able to buy into the program. Other health reform alternatives, such as the public option, cost less for participants. ""Let's see how they [Conrad and others] explain that they are going to get to 10 to 12 million members. ... I can't see how that's going to happen,"" Jost said. Probably the biggest barrier, Jost said, is entering a new market and trying to establish a network. ""You have to go out there, you have to contract with hospitals, doctors, other providers of care. Well, the private insurers have their networks in place, and they often have what they call 'most favored nations' clauses, which provide that a provider cannot [offer] a lower rate than it does to the dominant insurer."" The idea of co-ops appears to have received some support from the Obama administration. A top White House aide told Bloomberg Television's ""Conversations with Judy Woodruff"" that President Obama may accept nonprofit health insurance cooperatives in place of a new government-run plan. ""We would be interested in that"" if certain conditions are met, said Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform. And the idea has gotten support from a key Republican senator. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that co-ops are ""a step in the right direction."" ""I don't know if it will do everything people want, but we ought to look at it. I think it's a far cry from the original proposals."" But not everyone is so sure that co-ops will work to reduce health care costs across the board. CNN Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, who spoke with top officials at both co-ops, said this type of model would not solve the problem of uninsured Americans. ""Will co-ops solve that? No. That is according to two folks who run co-ops [one in Seattle and one in Minneapolis]. ... They said 'we are not charities. You have to spend money and pay premiums to join our co-ops. And we don't take everyone. We sometimes say no to people with pre-existing conditions,' "" she said. Co-ops also may not have the industry clout of the big insurance companies.  Watch Obama discuss his plan for health care reform » . ""They [co-ops] would have some cost advantages over private plans -- they wouldn't have to make a profit -- but they are going to be running on a very small scale, at least initially, and therefore they are going to have very high administrative costs proportionate to claims,"" Jost said. ""But again, the big problem is how are they going to get providers to give them a better deal than the providers give the private insurers. They may not even be able to legally do that under their contracts with the commercial insurers,"" he added. CNN's Dana Bash, Lesa Jansen and Chris Welch contributed to this report.",0.799658,6535
43,"New York (CNN) -- If President Obama had been forthright last week at the health care summit, he would have opened the meeting by stating: ""If you have health coverage, under our reform bills you are going to pay more and get less. If you are one of the 45 million elderly or disabled people on Medicare, you are going to get less. There is no such thing as free medical care. Somebody has to pay!  And in the end it is you."" Those are the facts! And as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stated to the Republicans : ""...you're entitled to your opinion, but not your own facts."" However, the facts, as the president has found out, are not exactly a compelling message to persuade a reluctant Congress and public to overhaul nearly one-fifth of the nation's economy. Adding 31 million people (45 million now don't have coverage) to the health care system will cost the taxpayers trillions over time. Many of that uninsured group can't afford health insurance, and if this legislation passes, the government will create an entitlement program to subsidize them. In the end, like the entitlement programs that have gone before them, they will far exceed any cost estimates on the table today. Just to remind you, Mr. President and members of Congress,  the taxpayers have a right to know the full fiscal consequences of this legislation. The United States is spending this year nearly $2.5 trillion on health care. That is 17.3 percent of the U.S. economy and it's rising at a rapid rate. We spent $134 billion more in the past year than in the year before. To put $2.5 trillion into perspective, that is more money than the federal government received in taxes and revenues this year. The problem is nobody knows (and especially the Congress) what a trillion dollars really means. A trillion is a million million. Still means nothing to most of us. If you spent a million dollars a day since the birth of Jesus Christ, it wouldn't even equal a trillion. If you stacked up a trillion dollars in dollar bills, it would reach 68,000 miles into the sky, about a third of the way from the Earth to the moon. Those numbers are too big for any of us. Somebody has to pay for the most expensive health care in the world. Many experts would argue it is also the very best health coverage in the world. Health care today is paid for by three entities. The government  (federal, state and local) pays more than 50 percent of the costs. That is us, the taxpayers. The insurance companies pay about one-third of the costs. That again is us. We pay the premiums and the insurance company pools the risk, and distributes our monies back for the medical services. They obviously add an overhead cost as does any business, but it's still our money being paid out. The third payer is again us. Out-of-pocket reimbursements or additional fees come directly out of our pocket and paycheck. Health care has changed as dramatically as anything in our society in the last half century.  First, we are living longer. In 2007, American men could expect to live 3.5 years longer and women 1.6 years longer than in 1990. We are long past the days when you walked into a doctor's office and the doctor -- armed only with a stethoscope, blood pressure monitor and a thermometer -- listened to our symptoms and made a diagnosis. Maybe in a rare case an X-ray was called for. We paid our bill and went to the drugstore and got our prescription.  There were no MRI's, no heart diagnostic tests, no CT scans or any of the wonder drugs that have extended our lives and in many cases made the quality better. It's not that people aren't seeing doctors. In the last several years, more than 1.2 billion annual visits to a physician's office have taken place, averaging more than three a year per person. Certainly, some efforts must be made to provide some insurance reform -- but that also means malpractice insurance reform. Some massive efforts need to be made to curb Medicare and insurance fraud. And efforts must be made to create more competition among insurance companies across state lines. The president's attempt to add some of the better suggestions from the Republicans addressing these issues is not going to add any support from that side of the aisle. They are minor changes that are positive but don't tackle the fundamental cost issues or address the new entitlements and mandates that Republicans object to most. Reducing costs in most cases means reducing services. Who doesn't want an MRI for their child injured in a car wreck? Who doesn't want tests done on a spouse or parent who has chest or abdominal pain? But if Reid and Pelosi shove this legislation through Congress against public opinion, they and their party will pay a price. Yet the price Democrats will pay at the polls in November won't be nearly as big a price as our kids and grandkids will pay when the bill comes through years hence.

44,"(CNN) -- Five years from now, there's an excellent chance you won't have the same health insurance you have (or don't have) right now. That's because members of Congress are gearing up to reform the U.S. health care system, and unlike in 1993 when then-first lady Hillary Clinton tried her hand at changing the medical system, this time  the important players -- doctors, insurance companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers -- seem to be on board. You heard a lot about health care reform this week, and you'll be hearing even more in the months to come. It's an incredibly confusing, complex issue, so in this week's Empowered Patient, we break it down for you with 10 frequently asked questions about health care reform. Overhauling health care  is key to U.S. economic stability, President Obama tells doctors Monday. 1. Why is health care reform such a hot issue right now? Fewer and fewer Americans have health insurance, and therefore cannot afford good medical care. Nearly 46 million Americans have no insurance, and 25 million more are underinsured. One major reason for this crisis is that many employers have stopped offering insurance to employees because of the high cost. In the United States, total health care spending was $2.4 trillion in 2007 -- or $7,900 per person -- according to an analysis published in the journal Health Affairs. The United States spends 52 percent more per person than the next most costly nation, Norway, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. There's little debate that health care reform is necessary -- President Obama, Republican and Democratic members of Congress, the American Medical Association and America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents the insurance industry, all have agreed the system needs to be changed, although they disagree on how to do it. 2. So let's start with Obama. What are his plans for revamping the system? A central point of the president's plan is to create a government-sponsored health insurance program that would be an option for all Americans, similar to how Medicare is now an option for Americans over age 65. He has also said he'd ""like to see"" prohibitions against insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, and incentives for people to use preventive services and wellness plans. Obama outlined this plan last week at a town hall meeting in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and on his Web site. 3. How does the president plan to pay for this? Obama said he's already identified ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" worth of savings in the federal budget that could help finance health care reform, such as rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. He's also proposed reducing tax deductions for high-income Americans. 4. What do the Republicans think of Obama's plan? In particular, they don't like the idea of having a government-sponsored health insurance program for all Americans. They fear employers would opt for the government-run insurance over private insurance because the government option would most likely be less expensive, but Republicans say it would also be lower quality. For information, see House Minority Leader John Boehner's Web site. 5. Since they don't like Obama's ideas, how would Republicans like to reform health care? Republicans think Obama's plan is costly and will make health insurance more expensive, not less. In a plan outlined this week, House Republicans proposed individual tax breaks for buying health insurance and ""pools"" of states and small business to get lower-cost health care plans. They also proposed increasing incentives for people to build health savings accounts, allowing dependent children to stay on parents' policies until age 25 and encouraging employers to reward employees for improved health. 6. I'm happy with the insurance I receive from my employer. What would health care reform mean for me? If you receive high-quality health insurance from your employer, Obama said, his plan won't change that, and you can still keep your insurance and your doctors. Republicans, however, said that if Obama gets his way, there's a good chance your employer will stop buying the private insurance you have now and instead opt for the less-expensive government plan. 7. I have a pre-existing condition and can't get health insurance. Will health care reform help me? You have a terrible problem and you're in good company. Millions of people who don't get insurance through their employer try to get insurance on their own and are turned down because they have a pre-existing condition. Obama said at the Green Bay town hall meeting that under his reforms, no insurance plan ""would be able to deny coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions,"" but he didn't explain how he would force insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing health problems. Similarly, Boehner wrote on his blog that ""quality health coverage must exist for every American, regardless of pre-existing health conditions,"" but did not explain how he would pay to insure people with pre-existing conditions. 8. How do doctors feel about health care reform? The American Medical Association said while it believes in health care reform, ""the AMA does not believe that creating a public health insurance option ... is the best way to expand health insurance coverage."" The AMA has told members of Congress that doctors fear a new government-sponsored health insurance program would reimburse them at Medicare rates. ""Medicare reimbursement rates have not kept pace with the cost of practice,"" AMA President Dr. Nancy Nielsen told CNN earlier this week. ""Our Medicare rates are back at 2001 rates, and the reality is, that's not where our rent is, that's not where the electricity is. The system for paying doctors is a broken system, and everybody acknowledges it."" Other doctors' groups, however, support the idea. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the National Physicians Alliance and other groups put out a statement of support this week for Obama's plan. ""Having the choice of a public health insurance plan will help make health care more affordable for patients, foster greater competition in the insurance market and guarantee that quality, affordable coverage will be there for our patients no matter what happens,"" they wrote in a joint statement.. 9. Obama has mentioned high health care costs in McAllen, Texas, several times. What's up with that? According to research conducted at the Dartmouth Institute, the average per person health costs for McAllen are sky-high compared with costs in other cities. In McAllen, the average Medicare beneficiary spends $15,758 per year, while the average Medicare patient in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, spends $6,412 per year. Another comparison: The cost in Miami, Florida, is $18,170, compared with $7,478 in Portland, Oregon. Dartmouth researchers believe doctors in high-priced cities tend to refer to specialists more and are more likely to put patients in the hospital rather than handling their problems on an outpatient basis. 10. How do health care costs in the U.S. compare with costs in other countries? In the United States, every person spends on average $6,714 for health care. That's significantly higher than in the United Kingdom, where $2,760 per person is spent; or in France, where the cost is $3,449 per person; or in Canada, where medical costs are $3,678 per person, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. While some would argue that medical care is better in the United States than in these other countries, others would say the opposite is true. For example, the United States ranks 50th in life expectancy, and 180th infant mortality (meaning 179 countries have higher infant mortality rates such as Angola and Turkey and 43 countries have lower infant mortality rates such as France and Sweden) according to the CIA World Factbook.

45,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama and top aides have quietly stepped up talks with moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine on a scaled-back health care bill, according to two sources familiar with the negotiations. Sen. Olympia Snowe is part of the bipartisan so-called ""Gang of Six"" negotiating on health care. The compromise plan would lack a government-run public health insurance option favored by Obama, but would leave the door open to adding that provision down the road under an idea proposed by Snowe, the sources said. One of the sources said White House officials are ""deep in conversations"" with Snowe on a much smaller health care bill than Obama originally envisioned. The modified proposal would include insurance reforms, such as preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, according to the source. The potential deal would give insurance companies a defined period to make such changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a so-called ""trigger"" would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies, the source said. Snowe is pivotal to the debate because she may be Obama's last possibility for getting a Republican senator to support his push for a health care overhaul. She is one of the so-called ""Gang of Six"" members of the Senate Finance Committee, three Democrats and three Republicans, involved in separate negotiations on the only bipartisan health care proposal in Congress so far. However, the slow pace of those talks and recent partisan attacks by the other two Republicans in the negotiations have dimmed hopes for a breakthrough, leaving Snowe as the only Republican senator that White House aides believe they can work with on the issue. Snowe first proposed the so-called ""trigger"" idea for a public option months ago, and has talked to Obama about it on several occasions, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The source told CNN that the White House staffers increased their phone calls to Snowe aides and their interest in her trigger idea this week. Obama and Democratic leaders seek a solution that could win support from a Republican or two, and more importantly, help bridge a divide among Democrats on the public option issue. Allies of the president hope that if Snowe accepts a health care agreement, she might also bring along her Republican colleague from Maine, moderate Sen. Susan Collins. Getting some Republicans to sign onto a proposal would improve Obama's chances of gaining the support of key moderate Democratic senators such as Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. All three are skeptical of a government-run public option supported by their more liberal fellow Democrats. Despite the flurry of direct talks this week between Snowe and White House staff, Snowe aides insist she remains engaged in the ""Gang of Six"" bipartisan talks that have been going on for months. Those talks have focused on creating nonprofit health insurance cooperatives instead of a public option to force competition and lower medical rates. The source familiar with Snowe's discussions with the White House said Snowe's trigger idea isn't being considered in the bipartisan negotiations because of early resistance from fellow Republican negotiators, especially Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming. Enzi and the other Republican negotiator, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, insist they are still committed to the bipartisan negotiations. However, their recent sharp criticism of Democratic health care proposals favored by Obama has caused tense relations with the White House.",0.79240656,6901
46,"Editor's note: Kathleen Sebelius is secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Kathleen Sebelius says health care costs are a huge and growing burden on the economy. (CNN) -- Today in Washington, some politicians like to suggest that the many challenges we face as a nation mean we shouldn't tackle health care reform. Nothing could be further from the truth. With more and more of America's families, businesses, and local, state and federal governments struggling with the crushing costs of health care, health care reform has never been more important. As President Obama has often said, you can't fix the economy without fixing health care. Unless we fix what is broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Health care reform is not a luxury. It is a necessity. It's important to look at the size of the problem we face and where we stand. Today, we have by far the most expensive health system in the world. We spend 50 percent more per person on health care than the average developed country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We spend more on health care than housing or food, the McKinsey Global Institute reported. Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, millions more are underinsured, and they aren't the only ones who are suffering. The high cost of care is hurting all of us. A recent study by Families USA estimates that insured families pay a hidden health tax of more than $1,000 every year. The hidden tax is the amount businesses and families with insurance have to pay in insurance premiums, taxes and donations to help cover the cost of treating uninsured Americans. Health insurance premiums for families that are covered through a job at a small business have increased 85 percent since 2000, and more small businesses are thinking about dropping health insurance benefits. Nationwide, health care costs consume 18 percent of our gross domestic product. If we continue on our current path, health care costs will consume 34 percent of our GDP by 2040, and the number of uninsured Americans will rise to 72 million, according to the Council of Economic Advisers. Even though we spend more than any other nation on health care, we aren't healthier. Only three developed countries have higher infant mortality rates. Our nation ranks 24th in life expectancy among developed countries. More than one-third of Americans are obese. These statistics are the signs of a system that is both unacceptable and unsustainable. They also show us the high cost of doing nothing. If we choose the status quo, more Americans will be uninsured, costs will continue to rise, and every American's health care will be at risk. Inaction is not an option, and reform is long overdue. The Obama administration is working to enact reform that will reduce costs for families, businesses and government; protect people's choice of doctors, hospitals and health plans; and assure affordable, quality health care for all Americans. We are guided by a simple principle: Protect what works about health care and fix what's broken, and do it in a way that does not add to the deficit. The president has already introduced proposals that will provide $950 billion over 10 years in savings to finance health care reform. Much of these resources come from wringing waste out of the current system and aggressively prosecuting fraud and abuse. We will continue to work with Congress as it explores other financing options, and the president is open to ideas about how we finance health care reform. But we are not open to deficit spending. Health care reform will be paid for, and it will be deficit-neutral over 10 years. Working together, we can pass real health care reform that gives Americans the choices they deserve and the affordable, quality coverage they need. And we know they do not want us to wait. Too many people have suffered without basic medical care or paid too much for it. For years, the American people have called on Washington to meet this challenge. They have waited long enough. The time for reform is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Sebelius.",0.7898396,5190
47,"Washington (CNN)  -- President Obama said he wouldn't pat himself on the back for his first year in office, but said Wednesday he showed he can make tough decisions that were unpopular. In a year-end interview with PBS, Obama said he was ""entirely dissatisfied"" with the high unemployment rate still facing Americans as the economic recession ends. ""I don't pat myself on the back,"" Obama said. But his administration deserved credit for making good decisions on major problems it inherited, including the recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other issues, he said. Without specifying any issue, Obama said he demonstrated that his administration was willing to face tough decisions. ""I think I've shown this year that I can make hard decisions, even when they're not popular,"" the president said. Last month, Obama decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan to bolster the counterinsurgency strategy favored by military commanders on the ground. The move was criticized by some fellow Democrats and favored by most Republicans. Obama also moved forward on plans to shut the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility and bring some suspected terrorists held there to a U.S. prison in Illinois. The plan has been heavily criticized by Republicans. In addition, the president made health care reform his domestic priority for 2009 and endorsed sweeping provisions contained in a bill passed by the House and on the verge of final passage by the Senate. Republican opposition to the health care legislation has been almost unanimous, and concessions made during the Senate debate have caused some Democrats to question the value of the measure scheduled for a final vote on Thursday. Obama rejected criticism from some liberals that a final bill would be too watered down, saying in the PBS interview that the bill delivered most of the benefits he listed when the debate began back in January. ""This notion that somehow this health care bill that's emerging should be grudgingly accepted by Democrats as half a loaf"" is wrong, Obama said. ""This is 95 percent of the loaf.""",0.7809162,7807
48,"Washington (CNN) -- He was talking about health care, but President Obama could have just as easily been summing up his entire first year when he made some blunt comments in a closed-door meeting with House Democrats last week. Democratic sources who were in the room say Obama, pressed by liberals angry about the reform package getting watered down, decided to quote Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who said recently: ""What we're building here is not a mansion, it's a starter home. It's a starter home, but it's got a great foundation for expanding health care coverage to 31 million Americans."" Obama's point was that he believes the health bill -- if it can pass (and that's in real doubt now) -- would be a dramatic step forward but is just the first draft. He hopes to come back later in his presidency to pass a second reform package that finishes the job. The same goes for other big Obama promises like energy reform to deal with climate change and financial regulatory reform to clean up Wall Street -- ""mansions"" that have not been built yet, even though a strong ""foundation"" has been put down to meet these promises in the future. But Republican Scott Brown's stunning victory in Massachusetts on Tuesday suggests Obama may not even get the first draft of health care reform through Congress, because of a huge split in his own party: Angry liberals in the House are signaling they will not rush through what they consider to be the Senate's weak version of reform before Brown gets seated in the Senate, while skittish conservative Democrats in the Senate, like Ben Nelson of Nebraska, may no longer be on board with any kind of reform, out of a fear of becoming the next Martha Coakley. The broader problem Obama has been facing, even before Massachusetts, is that securing a mere ""starter home"" on health care or any other major issue is a far cry from the sky-high expectations he set for his supporters one year ago, when they were shouting ""Yes We Can!"" after a campaign in which he laid out plans for dramatic change. To be fair, the president warned in his inaugural address, one year ago Wednesday, that all of the nation's problems would not be solved so quickly. ""They are serious, and they are many,"" he said then. ""They will not be met easily or in a short span of time."" Nevertheless, most Americans skipped past that section of the speech, and focused instead on Obama's promise to end the bitter partisan divide in Washington on the way to shaking up the system. That goodwill from the early days evaporated quickly, and the president's approval ratings have dipped as disappointment has grown among the very independent voters who helped elect him in 2008. That's why he very deliberately tried to recalibrate expectations at a Washington church this Sunday as he delivered remarks celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""There was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath,"" Obama said. ""Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled. Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed the seeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through the generations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been tested before."" Poll: 51 percent approve of Obama after first year . Channeling the outrage that fueled Brown's upset victory in Massachusetts, House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia said the reason for the disconnect is that the president dropped the talk of unity too quickly and instead ""forged ahead with a narrow ideological agenda that has compromised his ability to create sustainable jobs and thereby fix our nation's most pressing problems."" In an op-ed on the new conservative Web site Daily Caller, Cantor charged his party has offered to work with the president but he has ""paid our proposals mere lip service when the cameras are on, only to rebuff our ideas in their entirety once the meeting ends. As a result, the history books may well look back on the beginning of the Obama presidency as the era of squandered opportunities."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs insists Republicans have not made serious overtures to meet the president halfway, perhaps hoping instead that Obama's struggles will help the GOP in the November midterm elections. And Gibbs says the real reason for Obama's problems stems from the fact that he made some tough decisions on unpopular -- but necessary -- government interventions to save the economy. ""Ensuring that the banks didn't collapse was not a popular decision,"" Gibbs said. ""The president strongly believes it was the right one. Ensuring that two domestic auto companies didn't go out of business -- not popular. Again, the president believed it was the right decision to make."" Obama also frequently reminds the public that in addition to inheriting that financial crisis, he was also handed two unpopular wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a continuing threat from al Qaeda, that have tested his mettle as commander in chief. All of that has weighed on Obama's approval rating, especially the difficult decision to send more than 50,000 additional U.S. troops to escalate the war in Afghanistan. The terror incident on Christmas Day was a fresh reminder that national security is a wild card for any president. As each day in office passes, it will become harder and harder for Obama to continue pointing the finger of blame at former President George W. Bush for all of the ""inherited"" problems. And in a strange way, Tuesday's election loss could help Obama refocus his agenda at the start of year two. A top Democratic strategist close to the White House said that it's a lot better for the White House to take its lumps now and readjust priorities in the weeks ahead to avoid much larger losses in the midterm election -- rather than coasting along now and then getting hit with an awful surprise in November. But will Obama and his top aides dig in and refuse to move to the middle a bit? Or will they acknowledge that Massachusetts is a wake-up call, as Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and other moderate Democrats have suggested, and make some adjustments? Then-President Clinton was briefly humiliated by the 1994 midterm election debacle caused in large part by his overreaching health care effort, but he quickly picked himself up off the canvas and started focusing on bite-sized initiatives that won Republican support and positioned him for an easy re-election victory in 1996. Ron Pollack, head of the liberal health group Families USA, is pushing Obama to finish off health reform quickly before Democrats lose their 60-vote supermajority in the Senate. But Pollack also said he thinks on some of the other big issues after health reform, like climate change and Wall Street regulatory reform, ""they will have to get some Republican"" lawmakers on board, and the new political reality may force some compromise on both sides. But Pollack added that it's ""way premature"" to suggest the Massachusetts race will bring a major shift to the political climate. He's still confident that as the unemployment picture improves down the road, ""people will see the good in Obama's policies"" on health and other matters, and his standing will improve. Of course, there's also the possibility the public mood continues to sour on the economy and Obama's other key initiatives like health care. Brown seemed to be warning in his victory speech Tuesday night that the anti-incumbent anger Obama rode into office could wind up blowing up in his face in November.

49,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush vetoed an expansion of the federally funded, state-run health insurance program for poor children for a second time Wednesday, telling Congress the bill ""moves our country's health care system in the wrong direction."" In his veto message, President Bush calls on Congress to extend funding for the current program. In his veto message, Bush said the bill is almost a duplicate of the proposal he spiked in October. ""Because the Congress has chosen to send me an essentially identical bill that has the same problems as the flawed bill I previously vetoed, I must veto this legislation, too,"" he said in a statement released by the White House. The bill would have expanded the State Children's Health Insurance Program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed October 3.  Track recent and historical presidential vetoes » . The president had proposed adding $5 billion to the program and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Democratic leaders said the new version addressed Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits, capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program and preventing adults from receiving benefits. Though the measure had strong bipartisan support, it fell short of the two-thirds majorities needed to override a presidential veto in the House and Senate. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Democrats were more interested in scoring political points with the veto than in reaching a compromise with Republicans. ""We could have resolved the differences in his program in 10 minutes, if the majority had wanted to resolve the differences,"" Boehner said. ""This has become a partisan political game."" The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who can't afford private insurance. Democrats wanted to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes. ""What a sad day that the president would say that rather than insuring [millions of] children, 'I don't want to raise the cigarette tax,' "" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She called for a January 23 vote on whether to override the veto. Meanwhile, Bush called on Congress to extend funding for the current program to keep the 6 million now covered on the rolls.

50,"Editor's note: Wendell Potter has served since May 2009 as senior fellow on health care at the Center for Media and Democracy, a nonprofit organization that says it seeks to expose ""corporate spin and government propaganda."" After a 20-year career as a corporate public relations executive, Potter left his job last year as head of communications for one of the nation's largest health insurers, CIGNA Corporation. Ex-insurance company spokesman Wendell Potter says the industry seeks to drive the health care debate. (CNN) -- Having grown up in one of the most conservative and Republican places in the country -- East Tennessee -- I understand why many of the people who are showing up at town hall meetings this month are reacting, sometimes violently, when members of Congress try to explain the need for an expanded government role in our health care system. I also have a lot of conservative friends, including one former co-worker who was laid off by CIGNA several years ago but who nonetheless worries about a ""government takeover"" of health care. The most vocal folks at the town hall meetings seem to share the same ideology as my kinfolks in East Tennessee and my former CIGNA buddy: the less government involvement in our lives, the better. That point couldn't have been made clearer than by the man standing in line to get free care at Remote Area Medical's recent health care ""expedition"" at the Wise County, Virginia, fairgrounds, who told a reporter he was dead set against President Obama's reform proposal. Even though he didn't have health insurance, and could see the desperation in the faces of thousands of others all around him who were in similar straits, he was more worried about the possibility of having to pay more taxes than he was eager to make sure he and his neighbors wouldn't have to wait in line to get care provided by volunteer doctors in animal stalls.  Watch Potter interview with Sanjay Gupta » . Friday morning my former CIGNA buddy sent me an e-mail challenging something he said his wife heard me say in a radio report about my press conference in the Capitol on Wednesday with Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, chairwoman of the House Rules Committee. ""She heard you say that these protestors are funded by the insurance companies. Frankly, nothing would surprise me, but certainly not each and every person,"" he wrote. ""If there was a meeting near me, I certainly would tell my local representative how I feel about this entire subject (and it wouldn't be pretty), and I certainly am not funded by anyone. So I am ultimately wondering what proof there is that seemingly ordinary Americans are finally protesting what is going in Washington and there are all of these suggestions of a greater conspiracy."" If the radio report had carried more of my remarks, he might have a better understanding of how the health insurance and its army of PR people are influencing his opinions and actions without his even knowing it. Until I quit my job last year, I was one of the leaders of that army. I had a very successful career and was my company's voice to the media and the public for several years. It was my job to ""promote and defend"" the company's reputation and to try to persuade reporters to write positive stories about the industry's ideas on reform. During the last couple of years of my career, however, I became increasingly worried that the high-deductible plans insurers were beginning to push Americans into would force more and more of us into bankruptcy. The higher I rose in the company, the more I learned about the tactics insurers use to dump policyholders when they get sick, in order to increase profits and to reward their Wall Street investors. I could not in good conscience continue serving as an industry mouthpiece. And I did not want to be part of yet another industry effort to kill meaningful reform. I explained during the press conference with Rep. Slaughter how the industry funnels millions of its policyholders' premiums to big public relations firms that provide talking points to conservative talk show hosts, business groups and politicians. I also described how the PR firms set up front groups, again using your premium dollars and mine, to scare people away from reform. What I'm trying to do as I write and speak out against the insurance industry I was a part of for nearly two decades is to inform Americans that when they hear isolated stories of long waiting times to see doctors in Canada and allegations that care in other systems is rationed by ""government bureaucrats,"" someone associated with the insurance industry wrote the original script. The industry has been engaging in these kinds of tactics for many years, going back to its successful behind-the-scenes campaign to kill the Clinton reform plan. A story in Friday's New York Times about the origin of the absurdly false rumor that President Obama's health care proposal would create government-sponsored ""death panels"" bears out what I have been saying. The story notes that the rumor emanated ""from many of the same pundits and conservative media outlets that were central in defeating Bill Clinton's health care proposal 16 years ago, including the editorial board of The Washington Times, the American Spectator magazine and Betsy McCaughey, whose 1994 health care critique made her a star of the conservative movement (and ultimately, the lieutenant governor of New York)."" The big PR firms that work for the industry have close connections with those media outlets and stars in the conservative movement. One of their PR firms, which created and staffed a front group in the late '90s to kill the proposed ""Patients' Bill of Rights,"" launched a PR and advertising campaign in conservative media outlets to drum up opposition to the bill. The message: President Clinton ""owed a debt to the liberal base of the Democrat Party and would try to pay back that debt by advancing the type of big government agenda on health care that he failed to get in 1994."" The industry goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view. I know from having served on numerous trade group committees and industry-funded front groups, however, that industry leaders are always full partners in developing strategies to derail any reform that might interfere with insurers' ability to increase profits. So the next time you hear someone warning against a ""government takeover"" of our health care system, or that the creation of a public health insurance option would send us down the ""slippery slope toward socialism,"" know that someone like I used to be wrote those terms, knowing it might turn many of the very people who would benefit most from meaningful reform into unwitting spokespeople for the industry.

51,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Wendell Potter knows a little something about the health care industry's practices and is not afraid of to speak out as the health care reform debate heats up around the country. Wendell Potter once was a vice president in the public relations department for insurance giant Cigna. The former vice president of corporate communications at insurance giant Cigna, who left his post, says  the industry is playing ""dirty tricks"" in an effort to manipulate public opinion. ""Words matter, and the insurance industry is a master at linguistics and using the hot words, buzzwords, buzz expressions that they know will get people upset,"" he told CNN Wednesday. Now a senior fellow on health care for the watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy, Potter writes a blog on health care reform. He is focusing on efforts to defeat legislation supporting a government health care plan -- something he supports. In early July, Potter testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, telling senators that ""I know from personal experience that members of Congress and the public have good reason to question the honesty and trustworthiness of the insurance industry."" Potter described how underwriters at his former company would drive small businesses with expensive insurance claims to dump their Cigna policies. Industry executives refer to the practice as ""purging,"" Potter said. ""When that business comes up for renewal, the underwriters jack the rates up so much, the employer has no choice but to drop insurance,"" Potter had said. In an e-mail to CNN, Cigna spokesman Chris Curran denied the company engages in purging. ""We do not practice that. We will offer rates that are reflective of the competitive group health insurance market. We always encourage our clients to compare our proposed rates to those available from other carriers,"" Curran wrote. But now, Potter is back in Washington at the invitation from Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York. He is questioning insurance companies' public relations tactics -- and says some of the questions from town hall meetings are familiar.  Watch more on the health care reform debate » . ""People talk about the government takeover of the system ... that's a buzz term that comes straight out of the insurance industry,"" he said. A Cigna spokesman would not comment directly on Potter's accusations. Instead, the company released a written statement saying officials agree that health care reform is needed. But the statement went on to say that officials don't see how a government-sponsored plan can accomplish that. But Potter's concerns fall right in line with the Democrats' strategy of hitting insurance companies hard this summer. Republicans argue that insurance companies aren't solely to blame for the health care crisis, noting that many of their constituents are perfectly happy with the current system. The Democratic Party is also dealing with a group of fiscally conservative members known as ""Blue Dogs"" who are worried over the high costs of the health care plans being bandied about. Slaughter says that the concerns over a government option may be set up to ""try and protect one industry"" -- referring to the health insurance industry. Potter insists he has no agenda -- just a deep passion for the issue. ""This is hard to do. It's scary to do something like this. I don't think I'm any more courageous than anybody but I feel I had to do this."" Potter also has said he decided to resign in 2007 after Cigna's controversial handling of an insurance claim made by the family of a California teenager, Nataline Sarkysian. The Sarkysian family made repeated appeals at news conferences for Cigna to approve a liver transplant for the 17-year-old, who had leukemia. Cigna initially declined to cover the operation, then reversed its decision. Sarkysian died hours after the company's reversal.

52,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- House Republicans on Wednesday presented what they called a ""sorely needed"" alternative to Democrats' proposals to overhaul health care. Rep. Eric Cantor says Republicans are drafting a plan to ensure all Americans have access to affordable coverage. Republicans want to make sure all Americans have access to affordable coverage, Rep. Eric Cantor, the House minority whip, said Wednesday. ""We do so by making sure we keep down costs and incorporate the ability for folks to pool together to access lower costs, to bring private sector into the game and keep government out,"" Cantor said. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have detailed how they would pay for their proposals. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said his party's plan will cost ""far less"" than that of the Democrats and ""provide better results for the American people."" Rep. Dave Camp, R-Michigan, who co-authored the GOP plan, said it's important to make sure the bill is one with a ""common-sense approach."" ""We are not going to have a bill that is larger than the GDP [gross domestic product] of most countries, which is what we are beginning to see roll out,"" said Camp, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. ""Clearly, if we move forward and this bill is on the floor, we are going to have to have a bill that is paid for and that's going to depend on what the scores come back."" A score is a preliminary estimate of the cost of proposed legislation. A preliminary review by the Congressional Budget Office of a plan being drawn up in the Senate found it would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years to extend health insurance to 16 million people who otherwise would not be covered, about a third of the roughly 45 million now uninsured. Camp said that the House Republican proposal calls for refundable tax credits for lower-income Americans. But Camp and Republicans have not determined key details for their proposal, including the amount of those tax credits or who precisely could be eligible. House Republicans on Wednesday planned to release a two-page summary of Camp's proposal, which CNN Radio obtained. Some highlights include: .

53,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- She stood by her husband throughout the contentious 2008 presidential campaign and during heated health care reform debates during his presidency. First lady Michelle Obama listens to remarks during a health care forum at the White House on Friday. Now, as the debate is reaching a fever pitch, first lady Michelle Obama is weighing in on the issue by focusing on how health care can affect families. ""What she's doing is putting a personal and human face on the issue ... there's nothing more crucial,"" said Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn. ""Everybody gets sick, and everybody has someone in the family that gets sick."" ""I think if you can humanize it and personalize it, it suddenly brings it home to people -- especially those who are screaming and yelling about the government taking over,"" Quinn said. On Friday, the first lady, a former hospital administrator, spoke about the issue to a crowd at the White House, highlighting her own family's experience with health care. In one touching moment, Obama recalled when daughter Sasha exhibited signs of potentially deadly meningitis when she was 4 months old. ""We didn't know what, but he [the doctor] told us she could have meningitis, so we were terrified. He said get to the emergency room right away,"" she said. ""Fortunately, things worked out."" ""But it is that moment in our lives that flashes through my head every time we engage in this health insurance conversation. It's that moment in my life, because I think about what on earth would we have done if we had not had insurance."" Mrs. Obama not only faced the issue as a mother, but also as a daughter. ""My father has multiple sclerosis. He contracted it in his 20s. ... He was able to get up and go to work every day, even though it got harder for him as he got sicker and more debilitated. And I find myself thinking what would we had done as a family on the south side of Chicago if my father hadn't had insurance.""  Watch more of Michelle Obama's message » . Quinn says that personal story is critical in the health care debate -- something that has been lacking in the president's message so far, which has often been deemed by pundits as too policy-oriented and too surgical in nature. ""What she's doing is she's humanizing the issue. And I think that has been missing in their [White House] campaign,"" she says. ""He's been so focused on the details and the strategy and the money that the individual problems and issues have seemed to have gotten lost in the fray."" Gloria Borger, a CNN senior political analyst, agreed. ""I think she's always been a great asset to him,"" she said. ""She can help in this health care debate by not getting involved in the minutiae of the bills, but essentially emphasizing the reason we need health care reform. And that's what she will stick to."" Michelle Obama was a lightning rod -- both good and bad -- throughout her husband's presidential campaign. Now, in her role as first lady, she has garnered greater support among American voters from both parties. A national survey by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press in April found that the first lady's positive ratings have increased since her husband took office. The poll found that 76 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her, which is up from 68 percent in January. ""Much of the change has come among Republicans, especially Republican women,"" the organization noted. ""About two-thirds of Republican women [67 percent] have a favorable impression of Michelle Obama, a gain of 21 points since January."" But a first lady's involvement in health care reform is nothing new. In the early '90s, first lady Hillary Clinton spearheaded the Clinton administration's push for reform, holding meetings, testifying before congressional committees and, in general, taking charge of the issue. ""Hillary Clinton was the architect of health care reform,"" Borger said. As for whether Michelle Obama is mirroring Clinton's role, the answer from both Borger and Quinn is absolutely not. ""I don't see any parallels at all. ... The Clintons came in, and they had run on the platform of buy one, get one free, a co-presidency and all of that. And she took over this huge thing herself. Bill wasn't doing it,"" Quinn said. She said the president, not Michelle Obama, was the was the one who pushed health care reform in his early domestic agenda. ""He promised in his campaign, and then he's the one that did it. This is not Michelle's plan. She hasn't been doing the town meetings and the national press conferences,"" she added. Borger said that the first lady is playing a completely different role. ""It's a much more supportive role, and it's a role out of the policy arena, but more in the arena of just why we ought to think we need reform.""",0.7714211,7752
55,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday she is ""praying"" that President Bush has a change of heart and does not veto a bipartisan children's health insurance bill that he has labeled an unwarranted expansion of government-run health insurance. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi applauds after signing the State Children's Health Insurance legislation Friday. ""The tide is going a different way than a presidential veto would reflect,"" Pelosi, a California Democrat, said. ""It was with great friendship that I reached out to the president this morning to say that I was still praying that he would have a change of heart and sign this legislation."" ""I think I have to pray a little harder, but I will not give up,"" Pelosi said. Pelosi's comments came a day after the Senate voted 67-29 for the measure, which would expand the State Children's Health Insurance program by up to 4 million children. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Friday said Bush still intends to veto the bill when it arrives at his desk. Perino also said the disagreement between Congress and the White House was a simple policy difference, not ""about who cares about children more than the other."" ""The president is saying, 'Let's take care of the neediest children first, let's not put scarce federal dollars toward a program that was meant for the poorest children and let it creep up to middle-income families with incomes up to $83,000 a year,' "" Perino said. Bush and many Republicans contend that the program's original intent -- to give parents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private insurance coverage for their children -- would be changed under the current bill, prompting parents to wind up dropping private coverage their children already have to get cheaper coverage under the bill. Perino also objected that the rhetoric surrounding the SCHIP bill has become too heated. ""I think it is preposterous for people to suggest the president of the United States doesn't care about children, that he wants children to suffer,"" Perino said. The bill enjoys bipartisan support. Eighteen Republican senators Thursday night joined all the Democrats in voting for expanding the popular program from its current annual budget of $5 billion to $12 billion for the next five years. Four senators -- Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas and Democrats Joseph Biden of Delaware and Barack Obama of Illinois -- did not vote. With the current program scheduled to expire Saturday, the White House encouraged Congress to send the president a continuing resolution extending the program. ""We should take this time to arrive at a more rational, bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization bill that focuses on children in poor families who don't currently have insurance, rather than raising taxes to cover people who already have private insurance,"" Perino added. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah was among those Republicans who split from the president. ""It's very difficult for me to be against a man I care so much for,"" he told his colleagues on the Senate floor prior to the vote. ""It's unfortunate that the president has chosen to be on what, to me, is clearly the wrong side of this issue."" Though 67 votes in the 100-person chamber would suffice to overturn a veto, the House version, which was approved Tuesday, fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.

Those principles, analysts note, are guiding her to find a compromise on health care reform currently stalemated in Congress. Jennifer Duffy, who follows the Senate for the Cook Political Report, said Snowe's independent streak is ""not new behavior for her."" ""I think they [Republicans] also realize that the only reason that the state of Maine has two Republican senators at all is the fact that they are very independent-minded and they vote their state,"" she said, referring to Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins. In fact, some estimates place Snowe as having voted with her party only 57 percent of the time in the current Congress. While her moderate views are at odds with GOP opposition to several of President Obama's economic plans this year, the senator's constituents seem to agree with her. In 2006, she won re-election with 74 percent of the vote, compared to her Democratic opponent's 21 percent. In 2000, Snowe received 69 percent of the vote. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2006, she said that while her views are moderate, Maine, like other New England states, has been ""naturally independent"" ""Oftentimes, I tell my leadership, don't blame me, it's just where I grew up,"" she said at the time. Snowe, 59, was elected to Congress in 1978 at age 31, and served Maine's 2nd District for 16 years. She ran for Senate in 1994 and won, ""becoming the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of the state legislature and both houses of Congress,"" her Senate Web site notes. Her political career began in 1973 after her husband, Maine Rep. Peter Snowe, was killed in a car accident and she was elected to fill his seat. After two years in the state Senate, she won the U.S. House seat held by William Cohen when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Snowe was elected to the Senate with 60 percent of the vote during the Republican revolution of 1994, filling the seat of longtime Democratic Sen. George Mitchell, who retired. She married then-Maine Gov. John McKernan in 1989. In 2006, Time Magazine named her one of the top 10 U.S. senators, calling her ""the caretaker."" ""Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington,"" the article read. ""But while Snowe is a major player on national issues, she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents."" Duffy said that if Snowe and Collins started voting with the Republican leadership all the time, ""They would probably both lose re-election."" Part of the so-called ""Gang of Six"" on the Senate Finance Committee, which includes three Democrats and three Republicans, she has been actively negotiating with the White House. The White House said that Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi, the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six, have backed away from negotiations, although Enzi released a statement that said he is still willing to talk. Snowe said it's important to work with the other party despite criticism. ""I think sometimes, yes, I'd find myself in that position, you know, with fewer and fewer ... people who are willing to reach across the political aisle and to create what I ... call the sensible center,"" she told NPR last week. ""I mean, that's where the majority of Americans are. And I try to sort of build those ... bridges."" Part of that bridge building was seen with her votes for the president's $787 billion economic stimulus package in February. For the past months, Snowe has been pushing the idea of a safety net plan, or ""trigger,"" for a public health care option as part of a key compromise. A source familiar with her negotiations with Obama said that's one of the things they're talking about.  Watch more on the health care debate » . The idea would give insurance companies a defined period to make changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a trigger would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies. ""This option would be available from day one in any state where -- after market and insurance reforms are implemented -- affordable, competitive plans still do not exist,"" she said in a press release. Her main concerns so far have been the high cost of health care proposals. ""What we have to do is develop a plan that's going to be available to people on an affordable basis, and, secondly, containing costs both for the American consumer and the American taxpayer,"" Snowe said in the NPR interview last week. Cost has been a major part of her bipartisan efforts in the Senate. ""Given the gravity of our economic circumstances, I am pleased that our bipartisan negotiations have yielded a consensus solution that will create jobs, assist the displaced and invest in our economy,"" she said at the time about the stimulus plan. She added that it is not a ""matter of labeling something as spending or as tax relief; it's finding and including in this package the vital provisions necessary for jump-starting our economy.""

57,"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The passage of health care will certainly rank as one of the major political achievements of recent decades. Legislation that will eventually extend health care coverage to more than 30 million more Americans, greatly expand the number of options that citizens have when purchasing health care, bring healthy citizens into the pool of the insured and thus lower costs and create important regulations on health care companies will be remembered as one of the biggest domestic policy changes since the Great Society of the 1960s. While most attention will focus on President Obama for pulling off a Herculean task that eluded many of our great presidents, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emerges from this battle as the real powerhouse in Washington. She has pursued a clear ideological agenda but through pragmatic political tactics. Like the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, she stands for something, yet knows how to round up votes. Since the 2008 election, Pelosi has been the most reliable leader Democrats have had. She has delivered on almost all of the legislation that the White House sent to Congress, even as her colleagues found themselves frustrated by a Senate that seemed incapable of governance. At three critical points in the health care debate, Pelosi delivered. First, she assembled a center-left coalition around the original House bill in November by pushing through a controversial amendment related to abortion that brought moderate Democrats on board with the legislation. Second, when many Democrats, including top presidential advisers such as Rahm Emanuel, contemplated breaking up the bill after the Massachusetts election, Pelosi stood firm and defended holistic reform. She ""kept the steel in the President's back,"" Democrat Rep. Anna Eshoo told Politico. Finally, in the past week she displayed the kind of vote-gathering skills that have been displayed by legendary figures such as Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas. From the start of Obama's presidency, Pelosi has argued that Democrats should focus on maintaining partisan unity rather than on achieving bipartisan coalitions. She has implored her colleagues to act with confidence rather than out of fear. Her goal has always been to find ways to keep Democrats together rather than bringing Republicans on board. In an era where partisan polarization makes true bipartisanship impossible, this is the most effective and realistic approach for Democrats. Her philosophy echoes the beliefs of another powerful leader who said: ""Show me a nation without partisanship, and I'll show you a tyranny. For all its faults, it is partisanship, based on core principles, that clarifies our debates, that prevents one party from straying too far from the mainstream and that constantly refreshes our politics with new ideas and new leaders."" That was from a farewell statement by Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Although Americans tend to focus on the presidency and give credit to the office for what does or does not happen, we often ignore the central role that Congress plays. During the 1930s and 1960s, legislators were essential to the success of the New Deal and Great Society, often pushing Presidents Roosevelt and Johnson in directions they were too scared to take. Rather than the cartoonish caricature that Republicans often use of Pelosi as a left coast, left-wing fanatic, she is something much more powerful -- and threatening to their party.

The State Children's Health Insurance Program measure passed in the House last week would expand the program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed on October 3. Bush had proposed adding $5 billion to the program, and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program. Democratic leaders said the new version addresses Republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving SCHIP benefits; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program; and preventing adults from receiving benefits. The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, but who can't afford private insurance.

59,"(CNN) -- ""Keep the government's hands off my Medicare."" Those words -- quoted by so many TV talking heads -- never seem actually to have been spoken by anyone. It's like that poodle in the microwave story: Everybody has a neighbor who heard it from his cousin. The town hallers were angry, but they were not crazy, and they were not stupid. They knew perfectly well that Medicare is provided by the government. They also knew that their government is proposing to change Medicare in ways they do not like. The health care reform plans backed by President Obama would cut hundreds of billions out of the the growth of Medicare spending over the next 10 years. More ominous for seniors than the dollar figure is the plan behind the number. The president wants to reduce spending on Medicare Advantage, the privately run plans that offer seniors a better deal than conventional Medicare. Over the longer term, the president aspires to shift Medicare patients to teams of health care providers paid by the year, instead of individual doctors charging fees for each particular service -- rather than by the particular medical service they perform. Meet new CNN contributor David Frum . The changes the president has in mind won't kill Grandma. But they will change medicine in ways Grandma may find uncomfortable. Ten years from now, Grandma probably won't have a personal doctor. Her Medicare will cover less -- and cost more. Medicare was under pressure even before the election of Obama. The gap between the future revenues and future obligations of Medicare and Social Security is estimated by the Social Security trustees at some $45 trillion. How much is that? Adjusting for inflation, it's the cost of fighting World War II -- 10 times. Medicare is the single biggest spending commitment of the United States. As Obama stacks enormous new health care spending commitments atop the old, Medicare's already bleak future grows dimmer still. Who wins as Medicare loses? The short answer is: the uninsured. The president will use the money squeezed from Medicare to extend some form of coverage to the 35 million to 40 million people estimated to lack health insurance. And who are these people? About one-quarter of them are foreign-born. Recent immigrants to the United States -- unlike the immigrations who arrived between World War II and 1970 -- have tended to be very low-skilled. Their labor is just not worth enough to their employers to support the high cost of an American health insurance plan: $13,000 a year, on average, for a family of four. So here's how the world looks to a Medicare enrollee: . Over the opposition of some 80 percent of the American people, your government allowed millions of poor newcomers to enter the country, many of them illegally. (Over the past 10 years, half of all immigrants to the United States have arrived illegally.) These people cut the lawns of your more affluent neighbors, tended their babies, cleared their tables after their restaurant meals. If you were not so affluent, they reduced your wages and crowded your schools, highways and hospital emergency rooms. Now you are being told that your old age will be made less comfortable to accommodate them. Unsurprisingly, you don't like it. The debate about immigration and health care has centered on whether immigrants who are here illegally might qualify for coverage under the Democrats' reforms. Theoretically, they will not be eligible, but since Democrats have so far voted against enforcement measures, some illegal immigrants will no doubt slip through. But the debate over illegal immigrants is a proxy for something larger and more unsettling to older Americans. The problem is not illegal immigration, it is all low-skilled immigration, legal and illegal. By importing tens of millions of people who earn too little to pay for their own health insurance, we have made this supremely difficult social problem radically more difficult than it ever needed to be. With ""Obamacare,"" the bill for four decades of permissive immigration has at last come due. Since the 1930s, the United States has run two different kinds of government social programs. One kind of program is sustained by contributions from the very same people who will benefit from the program in future: Social Security, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation. These programs have never been controversial. The other kind of program taxes some for the benefit of others: Medicaid, social housing, the old welfare programs for the poor. These programs have always been intensely resented. Medicare was the first kind of program: social insurance. Obama's public option will be the second kind of program: income transfer. That's the explanation for the resistance the president is encountering. And it's the emotion that explains the actual quote -- not the bogus quote -- we heard from so many town hall protesters this summer: ""Fix old. No new.""

60,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A leader of the conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats told CNN Wednesday he and other group members may vote to block House Democrats' health care bill from passing a key committee if they don't get some of the changes they want. Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas, is a leading negotiator for the Blue Dog Democrats on health care. ""We remain opposed to the current bill, and we continue to meet several times a day to decide how we're going to proceed and what amendments we will be offering as Blue Dogs on the committees,"" said Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas. Ross said the bill unveiled Tuesday by House Democratic leaders did not address concerns he and other conservative Democrats outlined in a letter late last week to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The conservative Democrats don't believe the legislation contains sufficient reforms to control costs in the health care system and believe additional savings can be found. Their letter to leaders raised concerns about new mandates on small businesses. Blue Dogs also say the bill fails to fix the inequities in the current system for health care costs for rural doctors and hospitals. The Energy and Commerce committee, along with two other House committees, is scheduled to take up the bill Thursday. Democrats outnumber Republicans 36-23 on the Energy and Commerce committee, which contains eight Blue Dogs, including Ross. If seven Democrats vote with Republicans against the bill, it would fail to advance to the House floor. Asked whether the Blue Dogs on Energy and Commerce are considering voting as a group against the bill if it remains unchanged, Ross replied, ""absolutely."" He didn't give details on changes the Blue Dogs want. But he did say he wasn't satisfied with the penalty exemption for small businesses that don't provide health insurance for employees. An earlier draft of the Democrats' bill exempted businesses from paying a penalty if their payrolls were less than $100,000. Democratic leaders raised that payroll amount to $250,000.",0.74334174,5698
61,"Baltimore, Maryland (CNN) -- President Obama and House GOP leaders promised greater efforts to step back from the partisan brink Friday, acknowledging that Washington's toxic political climate has made it increasingly tough to tackle major problems. The pledge was immediately called into question, however, as the two parties repeatedly expressed sharply differing viewpoints during a rare meeting at a House Republican retreat in Baltimore. Obama accepted an invitation from House GOP leaders to address their caucus. His speech Friday was followed by an often pointed question-and-answer session. ""House Republican leaders are grateful for [Obama's] willingness to come ... and have a frank and honest conversation,"" said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana. ""We welcome the dialogue with the president."" The president accused Republicans of frequently mischaracterizing his policy proposals, particularly in the health care debate. Republicans, in turn, complained the White House and congressional Democrats had ignored their ideas, locked them out of the policy-making process and unfairly labeled them as obstructionists. ""Both sides can take some blame for a sour climate on Capitol Hill,"" Obama said, adding that Democrats and Republicans need to be careful in choosing their rhetoric. ""A ton of civility instead of slash and burn would be helpful."" The president highlighted what he said was problematic GOP rhetoric on his health care proposals. Republicans, he said, had characterized the proposed program as some ""kind of Bolshevik plot."" In fact, he said that much of his plan was similar to what Republicans had proposed during the failed Clinton-era push to overhaul health care. Both sides need to ""close the gap a little bit between rhetoric and reality,"" the president argued. Calling his health care plan ""some wild-eyed plot to impose big government in every aspect of our lives"" leaves little room for bipartisan negotiation, Obama said. The president questioned how Republicans could negotiate in good faith after using such rhetoric without exposing themselves to conservative primary challengers. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he tried to be honest about differences over administration proposals. ""I truly believe a government takeover of health care ... is the essence of their bill,"" Boehner said. Obama conceded there's been a failure on his part to ""try to foster better communications even if there's disagreement."" He has promised regular meetings with GOP leaders in the future. Boehner welcomed the gesture but said it is equally important for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to give Republicans a greater role in the legislative process. Bipartisanship ""isn't about taking one little Republican idea and throwing it in a 2,000-page bill,"" he said after Obama argued that Democratic leaders had taken GOP proposals into account in the health care debate. ""If you're really serious about building a bipartisan product ... you need to do it from the beginning."" Republicans criticized the president for failing to fulfill a promise to televise all the health care negotiations on C-SPAN. Obama called the criticism ""legitimate"" but noted the overwhelming majority of committee hearings on the legislation had been conducted in front of TV cameras. After the bills had cleared the committees, however, it became a ""messy process,"" he conceded. ""I take responsibility for not having structured it in a way where it was all taking place in one place that could be filmed,"" he said. Obama and Republicans strongly criticized each other on a range of issues tied to taxes and spending. GOP leaders said Obama's $862 billion stimulus plan had been ineffective and repeatedly urged the president to consider an across-the-board tax cut. Obama said it would be wrong to slash taxes for the richest Americans or the banking sector in a weak economy. He also argued that the stimulus program had saved key jobs in GOP districts across the country. ""There is not a single person in here who, had it not been for what was in the stimulus package, wouldn't be going home to more teachers laid off, more firefighters laid off, more cops laid off,"" he said. ""The component parts of the Recovery Act are consistent"" with what many Republicans say are important, he said. The stimulus helped in terms of ""rebuilding our infrastructure, tax cuts for families and businesses, and making sure that we were providing states and individuals some support when the roof was caving in."" The president said he agrees with the GOP emphasis on fiscal responsibility but hinted that Republicans could do more to help control spending, including curtailing legislative earmark requests for their own districts. He also said he is willing to work with Republicans on the enactment of a line-item veto. ""There's not a president out there that wouldn't like that,"" he said. Despite their disagreements, both sides agreed the day's dialogue was a step in the right direction. ""I hope that the conversation we begin here doesn't end here, that we can continue our dialogue in the days ahead,"" Obama said. The day ""went very well,"" Boehner replied later. ""There are issues we do agree on"" and Republicans will work to find ""common ground."" We should ""set aside perhaps the things that the president believes in that we philosophically don't, but if there is some common ground we ought to go ahead forward with those,"" said Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia. Friday's meeting, he said, was ""the kind of discussion, frankly, that we need to have more of.""",0.7423166,9956
62,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government is establishing a new system for updating medical records of servicemen and women during and after their military careers, President Obama announced Thursday. President Obama made veterans' affairs a big priority in the 2008 campaign and continues to do so. The joint virtual lifetime electronic record will, among other things, help ensure a streamlined transition of health care records between the Pentagon and the Veterans Administration. It will provide ""a framework to ensure that all health care providers have all the information they need to deliver high-quality health care while reducing medical errors,"" the White House said in a background statement. ""When a member of the armed forces separates from the military, he or she will no longer have to walk paperwork from a [Defense Department] duty station to a local VA health center. Their electronic records will transition along with them and remain with them forever,"" Obama said in remarks delivered near the White House. The system will ""cut through red tape"" and allow new veterans to start receiving their benefits more quickly, he promised. During the announcement, Obama was joined by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. ""We welcome this news. ... This is a huge day for veterans and troops,"" Paul Rieckhoff, head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN. ""This is a good way for [Obama] to come back from Iraq and make a powerful statement."" The White House recently proposed a significant budget increase for the Veterans Administration, including an 11 percent hike in fiscal year 2010. In March, however, the administration abandoned a controversial plan to charge private insurers for treatment of veterans' service-connected ailments.

63,"Editor's note: Uwe Reinhardt is James Madison professor of political economy at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. From 1986 to 1995 he served as a commissioner on the Physician Payment Review Committee, established in 1986 by Congress to advise it on issues related to the payment of physicians. Uwe Reinhardt says health costs are rising at unsustainable pace, gobbling up middle-class incomes. (CNN) -- Watching the angry outbursts at town hall meetings on health reform and the continuing public ambivalence about current efforts to reform our health system almost makes me wish that the reform effort fails. Perhaps Americans need to be taught a basic lesson on the economics of employment-based health insurance before they will feel as smugly secure with it as they do now and before they will stop nitpicking health-reform efforts to death over this or that detail. And America's currently insured middle class will be increasingly desperate if health reform fails. Millions more such families will see their take-home pay shrink. Millions will lose their employment-based insurance, especially in medium and small-sized firms. And millions will find themselves inexorably priced out of health care as we know it. Milliman Inc., an employee benefits consulting firm, publishes annually its Milliman Medical Index on the total health spending by or for a typical American family of four with private health insurance. The index totals the family's out-of-pocket spending for health care plus the contribution employers and employees make to that family's job-related health insurance coverage. The Milliman Medical Index stood at $8,414 in 2001. It had risen to $16,700 by 2009. It is likely to rise to $18,000 by next year. That is more than a doubling of costs in the span of a decade! Since 2005, the index has grown at an average annual compound rate of 8.4 percent. Suppose we make it 8 percent for the coming decade. Then today's $16,700 will have grown to slightly over $36,000 by 2019. Economists are convinced that this $36,000 would come virtually all out of the financial hides of employees, even if the employer pretended to be paying, say, 80 percent of the employment-based health insurance premiums. In the succinct words of the late United Automobile Worker Union leader Douglas Fraser: . ""Before you start weeping for the auto companies and all they pay for medical insurance, let me tell you how the system works. All company bargainers worth their salt keep their eye on the total labor unit cost, and when they pay an admittedly horrendous amount for health care, that's money that can't be spent for higher [cash] wages or higher pensions or other fringe benefits. So we directly, the union and its members, feel the costs of the health care system."" (""A National Health Policy Debate,"" Dartmouth Medical School Alumni Magazine, Summer 1989: 30) Unfortunately, very few rank-and-file workers appreciate this fact. Aside from their still modest out-of-pocket payments and contributions to employment-based insurance premiums, most employees seem sincerely to believe that the bulk of their family's health care is basically paid for by ""the company,"" which is why so few members of the middle class have ever been much interested in controlling health spending in this country. The price for that indifference will be high. If efforts at better cost containment fail once again, and health care costs rise to $36,000 on average for a typical American family of four under age 65 -- as almost surely it would -- that $36,000 will be borne entirely by the family. That family's disposable income would be much higher if the growth of future health spending was better controlled. And, as noted, many smaller firms will stop altogether providing job-based health insurance. It would be a major problem for families with an income of less than $100,000 a year. In 2007, only about 25 percent of American families had a money income of $100,000 or more. Close to 60 percent had family incomes of less than $75,000. Here it must be remembered that the wages and salaries of the solid American middle class have been relatively stagnant in recent years and are likely to remain so for the next decade. Unemployment is not likely to fall significantly soon, regardless of what stock prices do on Wall Street. Indeed, often stock prices rise as firms lay off workers to drive up profits through leaner payrolls. This prospect -- relatively stagnant family incomes combined with family health-care costs that double every decade -- is what America's middle class should contemplate as it thinks about the imperative of health reform. It is a pity that this central issue seems to have been shoved aside by mendacious distortions from Sarah Palin, Betsy McCaughey, Rush Limbaugh and other extremist commentators seeking to frighten Americans with their prattle about ""death panels"" and ""pulling plugs on granny"" that no bill before Congress even remotely envisions.

64,"Editor's note: Kevin Pho, a primary care physician in Nashua, N.H., blogs at KevinMD.com . Dr. Kevin Pho says health reform can't succeed as long as there's a shortage of primary care doctors. (CNN) -- When President Obama recently cited the number of Americans without health insurance, he declared that, ""We are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women, and children."" Uninsured patients often delay preventive care, waiting to seek medical attention only when their conditions worsen. This leads to more intensive treatment, often in the emergency department or hospital where costs run the highest. Universal health coverage is therefore a sensible goal, and the reforms being considered all make considerable effort to provide everyone with affordable health care. But expanding coverage cannot succeed as long as there remains a shortage of primary care clinicians. After all, what good is having health insurance if you can't find a doctor to see you? Massachusetts is often held out as a model for national health reform, and the bills being considered in Washington emulate much of that state's 2006 landmark universal coverage law. As a physician in neighboring New Hampshire, I have had the opportunity to observe the effect of the Massachusetts reforms. Today, 97 percent of Massachusetts residents have health insurance, the highest in the country. But less publicized are the unintended consequences that the influx of half a million newly insured patients has had on an unprepared primary care system. The Massachusetts Medical Society reported that the average wait time for a new patient looking for a primary care doctor ranged from 36 to 50 days, with almost half of internal medicine physicians closing their doors entirely to new patients. And when you consider that Massachusetts already has the highest concentration of doctors nationwide, wait times will likely be worse in other, less physician-abundant parts of the country, should universal coverage be enacted federally. When patients are forced to wait weeks to obtain medical care, they inevitably find their way into the emergency department for treatment that ordinarily can be handled in a doctor's office. Indeed, since health reform was passed, according to state data provided to the Boston Globe, Massachusetts emergency rooms have reported a 7 percent increase in volume, which markedly inflates costs when you consider that emergency room treatment can be up to 10 times more expensive than an office visit for the same ailment. Alwyn Cassil, a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change, told HealthDay News that expanding coverage without improving access to care is a ""recipe for failure,"" as well as unsustainable, ""because it will just bankrupt us."" Massachusetts is finding out just how difficult it is to fiscally maintain universal coverage. In part due to soaring health costs, the state Legislature has proposed reducing health benefits for 30,000 legal immigrants and cutting funding to inner-city hospitals like Boston Medical Center, which, according to the Boston Globe, may ""force it to slash programs and jeopardize care for thousands of poverty-stricken families."" The success of universal health coverage depends on an adequate supply of primary care providers. But the Association of American Medical Colleges is forecasting a shortage of 46,000 primary care physicians by 2025, a deficit that not only will balloon under any universal coverage measure, but cannot be made up as doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants all gravitate towards more lucrative specialty practice. It's not only the financial incentives that need to substantially change for primary care to prosper. More important, the working conditions for the physicians already in the field have to improve. A recent survey in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that roughly half of primary care doctors reported practicing in a work environment ""strongly associated with low physician satisfaction, high stress ... and [an] intent to leave."" Primary care clinicians routinely face unreasonable time pressures, a chaotic work pace, and bureaucratic impediments. Onerous paperwork requirements that obstruct patient care have to be reduced. And instead of the current system which encourages doctors to rush through as many office visits as possible, physicians who take the time to counsel, guide, and address all of their patients' concerns should be rewarded. Better valuing the doctor-patient relationship will increase satisfaction, not only for physicians, but for their patients as well. Such solutions, however, have been largely absent from the health reform conversation. Although it is a moral imperative for every American to have access to health insurance, alleviating the shortage of primary care providers is of equal importance. The prospect of suddenly adding tens of millions of patients to an overburdened primary care system has the potential to make the already dire state of American health care even worse.

She works to engage the millennial generation and communities such as people of color, women and people of faith in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on Twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says the idea that young people don't care about the health care issue is wrong. (CNN) -- As Congress returns to Capitol Hill, back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform, one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock: the voice of young Americans. Just Thursday, there were more than 880,000 Facebook status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform, generated organically and spread virally from young people and other Facebook users across the country. Some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people's engagement in the debate despite the common, and categorically false, notion that young people ""don't care about health care reform."" Young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population, and two-thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007, according to research for the Commonwealth Fund. More than half of all young adults have low incomes (below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, $21,660 for a single person in 2009), and low-income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher-income young adults, according to the Urban Institute. And contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured, 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full-time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers. Millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign, according to the Rock the Vote Poll of 18- to 29-year-olds, conducted in February 2008 by Lake Research Partners. Whether it is the 25-year-old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who can't purchase insurance in the individual market, the 20-year-old line cook who doesn't receive insurance through her job or the 28-year-old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums, young Americans experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis. Nevertheless, despite a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey showing that 60 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 support Obama's reform plan, the voice of young Americans has been strikingly absent from the public, televised national debate. And that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform. Young Americans have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result, and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative (the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do). Without their voices, the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older Americans who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo, despite all signs that it is rapidly failing. Young people were such a vital force during the election, not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them. And what could be more needed now? But if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate, why the silence? Why does it appear as if young people aren't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future? Well, if we are gauging America's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling, screaming and death panel-ing at some town halls, no wonder we think young people don't care. Those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and ""drama"" in its politics. Or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a ""fired-up and ready to go"" base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls. Obama rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender. Or what about the fact that the president's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent's plan, rather than the current limit of 19 for those who don't attend college? This is what young people should have been told. But it isn't too late. As 2008 showed, young people, like all other constituencies, speak when spoken to. As the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle, President Obama has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along. It is beyond time for the White House, and other organizers working to support reform, to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found, both on- and offline, and empower them to make their voices heard. In the meantime, young people are doing it themselves. Students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums, designing health care T-shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials. They are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track. In order to succeed, the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm, support and perspective of young people. And time is running out.

68,"(CNN)  -- An organization of Christian physicians argued Wednesday against an impending rollback of a federal rule allowing health care workers to refuse to provide certain reproductive services, saying it's discriminatory. The rule protects the rights of health care providers who refuse to participate in certain procedures. The Bush White House proposed the rule in August, and it was enacted January 20, the day President Obama took office. It expanded on a 30-year-old law establishing a ""conscience clause"" for health care professionals who don't want to perform abortions. Under the rule, workers in health care settings -- from doctors to janitors -- can refuse to provide services, information or advice to patients on subjects such as contraception, family planning, blood transfusions and even vaccine counseling if they are morally against it. The Obama administration is expected to reverse the rule shortly, touching off a new wave of heated debate over what remains one of the most sensitive and emotional hot-button issues in American politics. "" 'Right of conscience' is under attack, and that is dangerous for our country, our health care system and our patients,"" said Dr. David Stevens, head of the 15,000-member Christian Medical Association. ""When the state demands that we surrender our conscience, it becomes totalitarian and dangerous. Do we want our professional schools to ethically neuter doctors of all moral convictions that are not approved by the government?""  Watch CNN's Sanjay Gupta discuss the 'conscience clause' » . Stevens was speaking on behalf of Freedom to Care, an umbrella organization of 36 groups working to prevent a rollback of the rule.  Watch why one pharmacist says the ""conscience clause"" is needed » . Many health care organizations, including the American Medical Association, believe that health care providers have an obligation to their patients to advise them of the options despite their own beliefs. And critics of the current rule argue that there are laws on the books protecting health-care professionals when it comes to refusing care for personal reasons. ""We don't make God-like decisions. ... That's not what it's about for us. It's about helping the patient make their own decision. ... No one appointed us to be the ultimate person to pass judgment,"" said Mary Jean Schumann, a member of the American Nurses Association. Dr. Suzanne T. Poppema, board chairwoman of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, praised Obama ""for placing good health care above ideological demands."" ""Physicians across the country were outraged when the Bush administration, in its final days, limited women's access to reproductive health care,"" she said. ""Hundreds of doctors protested these midnight regulations and urged President Obama to repeal them quickly. We are thrilled that President Obama [is taking steps] to ensure that our patients' health is once again protected."" Stevens argued that there is ""a well-funded and increasingly successful effort to discriminate against health care professionals based upon their deeply held religious and moral beliefs."" Rescinding the rule will send ""a clear message,"" he said: ""It's open season on health care professionals of conscience. Discriminate at will. If anyone should understand the ugliness of discrimination, it is our first African-American president."" Stevens predicted that a large number of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology would leave the medical profession if the rule is repealed. A final announcement from the Obama administration is expected with the conclusion of a 30-day public comment period on the proposed rule change. ""We do not want to impose new limitations on services that would allow providers to refuse to provide to women and their families services like family planning and contraception that would actually help prevent the need for an abortion in the first place,"" a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official said in February.

69,"(CNN) -- Rep. Joe Wilson said Sunday he will not apologize again for yelling out that President Obama lied during the president's speech to Congress last week. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, shouts ""You lie!"" during President Obama's speech Wednesday night. ""I am not going to apologize again,"" the South Carolina Republican said on ""FOX News Sunday"" when asked about pending disciplinary steps against him by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Wilson said he already apologized to Obama and that the president accepted it. However, he insisted that Obama ""was misstating the facts,"" and that Democratic leaders in the House were ""playing politics"" by continuing to focus on the issue. House Democrats plan to censure Wilson if he refuses to apologize on the House floor this week. Wilson issued a statement about that Sunday, saying, ""The American people are fed up with the political games in Washington, and I refuse to participate in an effort to divert our attention away from the task at hand of reforming health insurance and creating new jobs.""  Watch the debate over Wilson's comment » . The controversy has shifted the focus of the heated health care debate by calling attention to claims by Republicans that a health care overhaul sought by Obama and Democrats would provide free insurance coverage for illegal immigrants. Obama and Democratic leaders insist that nothing in any of the health care proposals currently before Congress includes health care coverage for illegal immigrants or would provide taxpayer money to help illegal immigrants buy private health coverage. However, Wilson and other opponents of Democratic proposals say the plans provide no enforcement mechanism to screen applicants for citizenship requirements. Wilson said Sunday that Republican amendments calling for such enforcement were rejected by congressional committees that have passed the Democratic proposals. When asked if Obama had lied to Congress, Wilson responded: ""I believe he was misstating the facts."" He noted that Senate Finance Committee members negotiating a compromise agreement have called for enforcement mechanisms similar to what Republicans are proposing. The national response to Wilson's nationally televised outburst, in which he yelled ""You lie"" as Obama spoke about health care to a joint session of Congress, shows the deep public divide over the issue. Wilson and his opponent for re-election next year have each raised more than $1 million since Wilson's heckling of the president on Wednesday, according to aides for each. In addition, Wilson has posted a Web video that asks for campaign cash to fend off attacks from political opponents. Immediately after Obama's speech Wednesday, Wilson issued a statement that apologized for inappropriate behavior. He also called the White House that night and spoke to Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who told Wilson that Obama accepted his apology. Obama said publicly that he accepted the apology. Wilson ""apologized quickly and unequivocally, and I'm appreciative of that,"" the president said. Wilson said Sunday that should be enough, adding that he respected the president and ""would never do something like that again.""",0.71506023,6303

""I think what we've seen is a dramatic difference in terms of how the United States is perceived around the world,"" Jarrett told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" on the final Sunday before the president's State of the Union address. Obama's travels have established relationships with world leaders that ""lay a foundation for keeping America safe and making us a partner around the world,"" she added. Jarrett also credited the president with having ""pulled back the economy from the brink of disaster."" ""That's an enormous amount of change when you consider where we were a year ago right on the brink,"" she said. ""And he's adding discipline in government to try to get control over our fiscal house. So I think that we've seen enormous change."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, on the same program, countered that ""if you look at the first year of this administration, we haven't made much progress.""

But McConnell, R-Kentucky, was also on the defensive about the GOP, which critics have been calling ""the party of no."" Asked to characterize the performance of his own party this year, McConnell said, ""What we did is try to operate on principle. The president decided to go hard left. That's why he doesn't have many of my members [supporting his agenda]. If he chooses to govern in the middle, he will have broader support."" Jarrett insisted the president never wavered from his promised bipartisan approach. Discussing his health care initiative, Jarrett said Obama ""has sat down with the leadership and members of the Republican Party, both the House and the Senate. In fact, bills in both the House and the Senate contain provisions that were suggested by the Republican Party -- so nothing's changed about the president's approach.""",0.71309006,9773
71,"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- Wendell Potter says he is finished defending the insurance industry, which he says is ""beholden to Wall Street."" Wendell Potter once was a vice president in the public relations department for insurance giant Cigna. At a hearing last week before the Senate Commerce Committee, the former vice president of corporate communications at the insurance giant Cigna testified, ""I know from personal experience that members of Congress and the public have good reason to question the honesty and trustworthiness of the insurance industry."" The committee's chairman, Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, told Potter, ""You are better than Russell Crowe on 'The Insider,' "" referring to the award-winning 1999 film about cigarette company executive Jeffrey Wigand, who blew the whistle on the tobacco industry's practices. In his testimony and during an interview with CNN, Potter described how underwriters at his former company would drive small businesses with expensive insurance claims to dump their Cigna policies. Industry executives refer to the practice as ""purging,"" Potter said. ""When that business comes up for renewal, the underwriters jack the rates up so much, the employer has no choice but to drop insurance,"" Potter said. CNN obtained a transcript of a 2008 Cigna conference call with investors in which company executives use the term ""purge."" But in an e-mail to CNN, Cigna spokesman Chris Curran denied the company engages in purging. ""We do not practice that. We will offer rates that are reflective of the competitive group health insurance market. We always encourage our clients to compare our proposed rates to those available from other carriers,"" Curran wrote. Cigna had revenue of $19.1 billion in 2008, according to the company Web site. P . ""It was almost like an electrical jolt,"" Potter said. At the event, Potter took pictures of doctors offering free health care to the uninsured. ""The volunteer doctors were seeing patients in barns, people in animal stalls,"" Potter said. ""It changed it for me."" He says he finally decided to quit in 2007 after Cigna's controversial handling of an insurance claim made by the family of a California teenager, Nataline Sarkysian. The Sarkysian family made repeated appeals at news conferences for Cigna to approve a liver transplant for the 17-year-old, who had leukemia. Cigna initially declined to cover the operation, then reversed its decision. Sarkysian died hours after the company's reversal. As Cigna's spokesman during the controversy, Potter had no role in the decision to deny coverage. But he was inundated with angry phone calls. ""After she died, my voice mail and my e-mail inbox were just filled with messages from people who were just outraged, "" Potter said. Now a senior fellow on health care for the nonpartisan watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy, Potter writes a blog on health care reform. In particular, he is keeping an eye on efforts to defeat legislation that would give Americans the option of joining a government health care plan, something he now supports. He says he witnessed how the insurance industry torpedoed health care reform efforts during the Clinton administration. ""They conduct what I call duplicitous PR campaigns. They'll say what people want to hear,"" Potter says. ""It's how they operate. You cannot trust these guys."" Potter is also taking aim at some of the TV commercials aired by groups opposed to changes. One such ad caught Potter's eye. Run by the conservative organization Patients United Now, the ad says that ""now, Washington wants to bring Canadian-style health care to the U.S."" ""Sometimes you'll see misleading information. And sometimes you'll see outright lies, like that [ad] is,"" Potter said, referring to the spot. Patients United Now spokeswoman Amy Menefee disagreed. ""We're not saying there's a Canada health care act of 2009,"" Menefee said. ""It is a trend. It's trending in that direction."" Potter notes that the leading proposals for health care in Congress do not seek to set up Canadian-style health care in the United States. He says claims that overhauling the system would lead to ""rationing"" of care are missing his point. ""What we have is rationing by corporate executives who are beholden to Wall Street. And it happens all the time,"" Potter said.",0.7010707,5019
72,"Only about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their employer-sponsored health insurance through the safety-net program COBRA, most likely because the premiums are too expensive, according to an analysis released Friday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that supports independent research on health care issues. Only about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their insurance through the COBRA program. Experts worry that the highest unemployment rate in 16 years, combined with a health care system dependent on employer-sponsored health insurance, is a recipe for disaster, and will swell the ranks of the uninsured particularly if people aren't using COBRA. About 46 million people in the United States (18 percent of those under 65) lacked health insurance in 2007. Health.com: Laid off? The healthiest ways to spend your time . The new report is based on a 2007 survey of 3,501 people. The researchers found that two-thirds of workers, if they were laid off, would be eligible for COBRA. Data from 2006 data suggest that only 9 percent would opt into the program. Health care insurance premiums have risen since then, so it's likely that the problem is getting worse not better, they say. ""The affordability issue gets worse every year, that's the big concern,"" says Meredith Rosenthal, PhD., an associate professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. ""Of course [some people can] still get an offer of coverage through a spouse, but we're still talking about very, very serious increases in the number of uninsured."" Health.com: Natural cold and flu remedies . COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) was passed in 1985 to allow laid-off workers to continue their health insurance if they lose their job. (COBRA only covers workers in companies that offer health insurance, have 20 or more employees, and are still in business.) But there's a catch. Most employers pick up 75 percent to 85 percent of the tab for their workers' health insurance, and once a person has been laid off, the entire bill falls on the ex-employee's shoulders. That means that health insurance costs dramatically escalate at a time when people have little or no money to burn. The Commonwealth Fund estimates that the cost of COBRA is four to six times higher than what people pay when they are employed; $4,704 per year for an individual and $12,680 for a family. Health.com: Live healthy for way less . Erin McCullar, 26, of Birmingham, Alabama, has type 1 diabetes and was laid off from her job as an interior designer in October. At the time, she didn't sign up for COBRA, a decision she now seriously regrets. Overwhelmed, she didn't realize she had a 60 days to sign up for the program and missed the deadline by a couple of days. ""On the day I got laid off I got a packet slapped in front of my face and that was it,"" she says. ""I was just totally in the dark."" She quickly found out that she couldn't get health insurance that would cover her type 1 diabetes, at least without a six-month or year-long waiting period, because it is considered a preexisting condition. She stockpiled a six-month supply of lifesaving insulin in the two-week period before she lost her job, but since then has scrimped on the drug to make it last longer. At one point, she even disconnected her pump, which delivers a continuous dose of insulin, for about three weeks. She used only a couple of insulin injections in that time to control high blood sugar, a potentially serious threat to her health. Even if she did sign up, she's not sure she could afford the premiums, which would have cost about $8,000 a year. Health.com: Healthy meals for under $10 . ""Ultimately, yes, I need it, but cost did factor into it,"" she says. ""I don't know that I would have been able to keep up my payments because I was barely able to keep up on my rent."" Cost is clearly a major issue for most laid-off workers, says Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund. Only 3 percent of workers near the poverty level who are eligible for COBRA opt to keep their insurance, compared to 14 percent of workers who made more money before they lost their job. It's a problem that ""is not going away,"" says Davis, ""The Congressional Budget Office estimates that we're going to go to 8.3 percent unemployed in 2009 and 9 percent in 2010,"" says Davis. (The unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in December.) She notes that each percentage point increase in the unemployment rate leads to a 1.1 million increase in the number of uninsured. ""So it's pretty urgent that the economic stimulus bill not only address the job situation, but address health insurance coverage too,"" she says. While some laid-off workers may get health insurance coverage though a spouse or partner, their research suggests that only about 14 percent of people who are not eligible for COBRA could get coverage through a partner or some other source after losing their job, she says. Rosenthal and other experts hope that if there is a silver lining, it's that there may be more political will to change the current health care coverage system. ""One of the biggest challenges to health care coverage reform has been that the status quo is okay for many people, particularly for many people who vote,"" she says. ""If that is no longer true, and if the people who have coverage now are insecure enough, they may be willing to give up something to get coverage security."" McCullar just hopes she can get health insurance soon. ""It sounds just colossally stupid to not have heath insurance, but I luckily had enough vials and insulin so I'm not near running out now, but I have to get health insurance in the near future,"" she says.

Gloria Borger says President Obama's plans are running into Americans' widespread mistrust of government. (CNN) -- So now comes the hard part. Now that a key Senate committee has finally moved a health care bill, President Obama can get to work to try and figure out a final version of reform. Now that Gen. Stanley McChrystal has recommended a large troop buildup in Afghanistan -- setting off an internal debate about recalibrating strategy -- the president can decide what he wants to do about the war. And now that the stock market is on the rebound -- while unemployment remains high -- Obama can figure out how to come up with a ""son of stimulus"" package that targets jobs. Tough decisions are part of the president's job description, after all. But here's the tricky part: how to convince the public that you -- and government -- will do the right thing, or are even capable of it. Sure, distrust of government is as old as government itself. And there's an inherent conflict in current public thinking, as scholars William Galston and Elaine Kamarck point out: While people want government to solve big problems like health care, they don't trust the government to do it. ""There is nothing new about this ambivalence,"" they write in an essay aptly titled ""Change you can believe in requires a government you can trust."" They write, ""But how ... the president deals with it may make the difference between success and failure."" So what's a president with a big agenda to do? He could have narrowed it, but instead decided to play ""all-in."" Because he was so popular, and because voters were so ready for a change, there was some thought the country might buy into the notion that good leadership could actually change the ethos of bad government. Obama probably believed it, too. So when the economic stimulus package was hatched, with hardly a Republican vote, the White House remained hopeful that, in the end, its success would restore confidence in their work. And they have since toiled mightily to brag about the stimulus package as evidence that government can work. After all, if FDR could do it, why not Barack Obama? Instead, the stimulus has become a handy target. Wall Street may be doing well, both conservatives and liberals rail, but the jobs elsewhere are not coming back. And as the president now moves to ask the nation to support an overhaul of health care, voters are still asking: Why should we trust the government to do that? Consider these numbers: At the end of the Bush administration -- with an unpopular president -- just 17 percent of the American public trusted the government to ""do the right thing"" all or most of the time. And for all of the popularity of Barack Obama, that number now stands at a measly 23 percent. After Bill Clinton lost health care reform -- and control of the Congress -- trust in government in 1994 was at an all-time low: 21 percent. We're almost there now. Ronald Reagan understood, and used to his benefit, the antipathy toward government. He used to joke that the scariest words in the lexicon were ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help."" He wanted to make government smaller, and his overall success with that notion prompted President Clinton to famously tell Congress ""the era of big government is over."" Well, it's back. The question is whether President Obama can convince us that more government is what we want -- and need. As Reagan once told us, ""Trust, but verify."" If only we could.

His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. Julian Zelizer says some of President Obama's political vulnerabilities have started to emerge. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- June has been rough for President Obama. After experiencing enormous success during his first months in office, some of his political vulnerabilities have started to emerge. As Republicans begin to think about the 2010 midterm elections and moderate Democrats decide how they should vote on Obama's most ambitious initiative, health care, the White House must prevent these weaknesses from becoming debilitating. The first vulnerability is the tension between the left and center of the Democratic Party. Since his election, President Obama has struggled to navigate the divisions that exist between the liberal base of the party, who were the core of his early support, and moderate Democrats, who were also instrumental to his victory. At first, the administration relied on good will and political capital from the election to overcome conflicts, such as when Obama agreed to reductions in the size of the economic stimulus package to placate the conservative Democrats and some Republicans despite the objection of progressives. But the tensions are becoming more pronounced and more difficult to resolve. The president has disappointed gay rights activists for not fulfilling promises they thought he had made on the issue of gay rights. Last week, they expressed their frustration with the Department of Justice's legal brief supporting the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that prohibits same-sex partners from receiving marriage benefits and protects states that don't recognize same-sex marriages. Obama failed to calm the storm even when he extended some employment benefits to the same-sex partners of federal workers. He came under fire for having declined to provide health care and retirement benefits on the grounds that such a move would violate the Defense of Marriage Act. These kinds of left-center tensions will intensify when Congress delves into the final negotiations over health care this summer. Progressive Democrats insist that without a public insurance option health care reform will fail in the long run. Several Democratic moderates have been pushing alternatives that fall far short of that goal. The second vulnerability is the deficit. When Republicans have turned away from cultural issues and toward economics, they have been finding more success at attracting the interest of independents and moderates. Recent polls have shown that the public is concerned about the growing size of the deficit and Republicans have finally gained a bit of political traction by linking Obama's policies to the government's red ink. To be sure, this is not a home run issue for the GOP. Many commentators have pointed to the hypocrisy of Republicans making anti-deficit arguments following the tax-cutting and spending spree that took place under President Bush. Moreover, deficits have a poor track record in terms of being a winning campaign issue. There have not been any presidential candidates or major midterm elections in recent history that hinged on anti-deficit arguments. Many presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, survived while growing the deficit. Polls have shown the public is also notoriously fickle about how much weight it gives to the deficit as an issue, and is often misinformed about the actual size of the deficit. Nonetheless, warning about rising deficits has been an effective tool for weakening the political strength of an incumbent administration. Regardless of the economics of the issue, with some respected economists saying short-term deficits don't matter, many Americans perceive the budget deficit as a symbol for whether a president is keeping federal spending under control. While Republicans might not take back Congress by focusing on the deficit, they can erode Obama's political standing and make it more difficult for him to pass legislation. Finally, there is the economy. The irony for Obama is that as the economy has stabilized, it has become a greater source of political danger. Without an immediate crisis, voters are not as panicked and don't feel as desperate for federal assistance. A growing number are more comfortable criticizing the administration's economic policies. Some Republicans have picked up on this and have asked why the U.S. needs to spend the stimulus money if the recession is almost over. At the same time, Obama is in a double bind: Most experts agree that we will have a fragile economy in the foreseeable future, so voters won't be happy either. If there is any new dip in the economy, the public will blame President Obama rather than President Bush. This is exactly what happened with the recession in 1937, which FDR's opponents called the ""Roosevelt Recession,"" using the downturn to diminish the number of New Deal liberals in the House and Senate in 1938. Does this mean Obama is finished? Not at all. The same polls that reveal vulnerabilities show that Obama is still extremely popular with the public and most evidence suggests that he has good standing with congressional Democrats. But in recent weeks a candidate who was once seen as invincible is now seen as potentially vulnerable. This is when the sharks start to circle in American politics. The revelation of weakness gives Republicans, as well as unhappy Democrats, more confidence to challenge the White House. This is not what the president wanted right as he is trying to win support for his health care proposal and the rest of his budget. If the problems are not contained, they can also become the foundation for the Republican campaign for Congress in 2010.

75,"SACRAMENTO, California (CNN) -- Debbie Brown used to process medical and dental forms for a living before a debilitating illness forced her into early disability retirement and left her in a simple, no-frills wheelchair -- a rented wheelchair that has cost taxpayers about $1,200. CNN found a wheelchair similar to Debbie Brown's taxpayer-funded Medicare wheelchair for a fourth of the price. Brown says the public should be outraged about her wheelchair. Why? She says she could buy a comparable wheelchair on the Internet for $440 if she had the money. It sounded hard to believe that her rented, $1,200 taxpayer-funded wheelchair could be bought for $440, so CNN decided to check -- and instead found an even better deal. CNN went to the same company that charges Medicare for Brown's chair, Apria Healthcare, and bought it for $349 -- about a fourth of what taxpayers' have paid for Brown's rented wheelchair. That's why this slightly built woman, who lives modestly with her husband in Sacramento, California, believes her story and her wheelchair underscore the bigger problem of reforming health care in America. ""Now you multiply that by how many people have a manual wheelchair, especially the baby boomers, it multiplies and multiplies and that money could be spent, even a hundred dollars out of that ... could give someone else the options that they need,"" Brown said. Reforming health care is at the top of the agenda in Washington. Everyone seems to agree this nation's health care costs and care availability are out of whack. Fixing it is another problem altogether. The Clintons failed. President Bush tried and got push-back as well. Now President Obama says he will do it because America can't put it off any longer. But he, too, is finding the way forward is not an easy path. Terms like ""affordability,"" ""single payer,"" ""universal coverage,"" and an entire lexicon have become part of the health care buzz lingo. It is a complex issue with so many facets, so many lobbyists and so many special interests that one proposal seems to result in a competing proposal or proposals, or competing parties with concerns of their own. To illustrate how difficult it will be to overhaul America's health care, CNN decided to focus on one item in the nation's health care bill: a basic wheelchair. The wheelchair, in its own small way, CNN discovered, gives a glimpse of the contentious and complex debate swirling around health care reform. CNN interviewed Brown and her husband, Dennis Brown, at a community center in Sacramento. It is a place the couple visits frequently; it is free, offers programs, books, entertainment and features a park to stroll in. Debbie Brown sent an e-mail to CNN months ago, outraged over the continuing Medicare payments for a wheelchair that after four years of use is not in the best shape. It squeaks and is hard to navigate. Her ride in it is made more difficult because her husband, retired from the armed services, is also on disability and has trouble getting the wheelchair in and out of the car. On days he is not well, he sometimes has trouble pushing her. She showed CNN her bills and documented the fact that Medicare is still paying for the wheelchair after all these years. Medicare, with Brown's permission, confirmed the payments. Brown referred us to the Internet sites where comparable chairs -- and better ones than hers -- are listed for a fraction of the cost Medicare pays over time. The Browns have a limited income and say they cannot afford to buy one. That's when CNN decided to check Brown's story by buying one directly from Apria, based in Lake Forest, California. CNN paid cash for the chair after calling one of Apria's offices in an Atlanta, Georgia, suburb. Apria representatives told the CNN buyer that the chair Brown had is no longer made but offered the model that is being rented and sold as the replacement model for the one Brown still uses. When CNN asked Apria why it rented wheelchairs to the government for $1,200, but sold it to us for $349, the company said it was an ""honest, unfortunate mistake."" Lisa M. Getson, Apria executive vice president for government relations, said in a letter that CNN ""should have been charged $949, in accordance with Apria's retail price...."" ""Since there's no comparable sale option in the Medicare system for such a wheelchair, our employee was confused by the sale request and charged the incorrect amount,"" Getson said. But the amount CNN paid is comparable to many other companies' prices on the Web. A quick check found two firms selling the Invacare Tracer SX5 for $289.00 and $249.00, including delivery. The manufacturer's suggested retail price is nearly $300 less than the corrected Apria price. Apria Healthcare said its costs are higher because of the stringent paperwork required by the government and because it provides 24-hour on-call service. Apria also points out that the cost of the wheelchair over the past four years has been less than 78 cents per day, a bargain because it allows the patient to remain at home. Wheelchairs are classified as durable medical equipment, along with such items as oxygen tanks and home infusion therapies. Apria is the nation's leading provider of home health care products and services, according to its Web site. The nation's $1 billion annual durable medical cost is only a fraction of Medicare's $444 billion budget last year, but one government officials believe it is time to rein in. That's where this story of the rented wheelchair gets caught between all the interests involved. Congress sets the rates Medicare pays and Congress determined that wheelchairs should be billed on a monthly rate for 13 months -- the renter has to pay 20 percent of the costs. After 13 months, a user can opt to own it  -- if the user knows about the rule. Brown, who worked in claims processing for years, said no one ever told her the wheelchair that barely works for her now is hers if she wants it. Instead, now that her rental term has ended, she gets billed by Apria every six months for service. Medicare pays $63 and she pays $16. Jonathan Blum, one of Obama's picks to reform the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said it is simply wrong that a wheelchair an individual can buy for $349 has cost the government $1,200. He said the government has a plan to fix it: competitive bidding. ""The good news is we have new authority right now to use competitive bidding to give the program much more flexibility,"" Blum said. But that's where the rubber -- or in this case, a wheelchair -- meets the road. Medicare has tried for years to get a bidding project off the ground. Last year, a bidding project was stopped after two weeks. The industry is flat-out against the government's proposed bidding project, contending it isn't competitive bidding at all. Opposing a bidding project is a well-funded lobbying industry, small- and durable-equipment businesses and special-interest groups who worry their ill clients won't be served if a bidding process as proposed by Medicare is put in place. So CNN loaded its wheelchair onto a Delta 757 to Washington and rolled it through the halls of Congress to find out why any representative -- not to mention 84 of them (the number who signed an April letter asking that competitive bidding be put on hold once again) would object to a plan that Medicare maintains will save taxpayer money. From Republican and Democrat alike, the answer was nearly identical as they sat for interviews next to CNN's $349 wheelchair. ""Well, you know what? I am a big believer in competitive bidding,"" said Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat from Ohio, where Invacare, one of the biggest manufacturers of durable equipment, is based. ""So at the outset I absolutely concur. But this program as it has unfolded, as it's been developed it really is a competitive bidding process that isn't competitive bidding."" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, agreed. ""My hope is that as we look at health care reform that some of those that are working off of theory, if you will, and the federal system will slow down and we look at where the lessons learned should be and we will think long and hard before they move aboard a single-payer or mandated to restrict choice and restrict options for individuals,"" said Blackburn. The American Association for Homecare, which represents many in the durable-equipment industry, said the bidding program is anti-competitive. In a statement, the association said the bidding program would ""sacrifice care for seniors and people with disabilities"" as it ""reduces patient access to and choice for medical equipment."" The association said competitive bidding will ""increase Medicare costs because it will lead to longer, more expensive hospital stays."" But John Rother, the head of policy and strategy for the retiree advocacy group AARP, said what's really happening is business trying to protect profits -- in this case profits four times the cost of Brown's wheelchair rental. ""It's an outrage,"" Rother said. ""It's a ripping off of the taxpayer. It doesn't make any sense to have those kinds of expenses for products that could be bought for so much less."" Medicare again plans to try to get its competitive bidding program started later this year in at least nine markets, although Blum said it is unlikely to go into effect until next year. As for Brown, her four-year-old wheelchair needs replacing. She's reluctantly applied through her doctor for a new one. CNN's Marcus Hooper contributed to this report.",0.68908435,5292
76,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britons including Prime Minister Gordon Brown have leapt to the defense of their creaking healthcare service after President Barack Obama's plans for a similar system in the United States were branded ""evil"" by Republicans. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a heartfelt message of support for the NHS via Twitter. Tens of thousands of people have joined a Twitter group expressing pride in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which offers free taxpayer-funded medical care to all British residents, while leading politicians have spoken out in support. Republican former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin earlier this week condemned Obama's plans to introduce a public heath insurance scheme as an ""evil"" move that would result in ""death panels"" deciding who would live or die. Her criticism has been echoed by fellow Republicans in direct attacks on Britain's NHS. In an article, Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said British healthcare was run by ""Orwellian"" bureaucrats who put a price tag on life. Sound off: What do you think of the British healthcare model? The comments caused a storm of protest in the United Kingdom, with Prime Minister Brown wading into the argument via micro-blogging site Twitter, where a conversation chain, ""#welovetheNHS"", is generating huge online traffic.  Britons react to the U.S. healthcare debate » . A posting on the 10 Downing Street Twitter site on Wednesday read: ""PM: NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort, despair and hope, life and death. Thanks for always being there."" The message was followed by another, from Brown's wife Sarah, adding: ""#welovetheNHS -- more than words can say."" Professor Stephen Hawking, author of ""A Brief History of Time"", also spoke out in favor of the British system, telling the Guardian newspaper that he owes his life to NHS treatment for the neuro-muscular dystrophy he has suffered from for 40 years. ""I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS,"" he said. ""I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived."" Despite the support, the 51-year-old NHS is regularly the target of criticism at home, with opposition politicians accusing Brown's government of mismanagement resulting in long waiting lists and a ""lottery"" in deciding who gets life-saving drugs and surgery. Nevertheless, opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron also added his voice to the defense campaign with a posting on his party's Web site. "" Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS -- including my own family. ""One of the wonderful things about living in this country is that the moment you're injured or fall ill -- no matter who you are, where you are from, or how much money you've got -- you know that the NHS will look after you."" His statement followed comments from one of his own party members backing the Republican criticism of the NHS.

78,"(CNN) -- Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius was sworn in Tuesday night as secretary of Health and Human Services. Kathleen Sebelius dives into discussing the swine flu at the White House after being sworn in. She was sworn after she was confirmed by the Senate in a 65-31 vote. The timely vote puts Sebelius in office as the Obama administration is up against its first public health outbreak. She steps into the role as swine flu numbers climb worldwide. As of Tuesday morning, at least 90 cases had been confirmed, including 50 in the United States. Until her confirmation, the White House, which declared a public health emergency Sunday, was dealing with its first crisis without a secretary. But the administration said it was equipped to handle the situation. There are still no appointees in place for any of the department's 18 key positions. Related: White House health team not complete . In most cases where a position is awaiting Senate confirmation, that job is filled by a career civil servant in an interim capacity. The Obama administration has named five nominees for the open positions. Sebelius met several obstacles during her confirmation hearings. The Kansas governor came under fire for her ties to Dr. George Tiller, a late-term abortion provider. Tiller and his staff attended a 2007 reception Sebelius held at the governor's mansion in Topeka. Sebelius originally failed to account for donations she received from the doctor. Sebelius also revealed in March that she recently paid nearly $8,000 in back taxes and interest. She said she had errors in her 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns. Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov. John Gilligan, who led that state from 1971 to 1975. A two-term Democratic governor in a Republican-leaning state, she previously served as a state insurance commissioner and oversaw Kansas' Medicaid program. She has been credited with boosting health care assistance for the poor during her tenure. A number of leading social conservatives have criticized Sebelius for her record on abortion, citing, among other things, her veto as governor of legislation that would have tightened abortion regulations in Kansas. In vetoing the measure last April, Sebelius wrote that the bill was problematic because it included no exceptions for pregnancies that endanger a woman's life and it allowed individuals to seek court orders preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even if the procedure was necessary to save her life. Some Republicans, however, have strongly defended Sebelius. Former Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, also from Kansas, testified on Sebelius' behalf in March, arguing that her record had proven her ability to work in a bipartisan manner. ""Sebelius' strength is that she understands health care [and is] willing and able ... to bring parties together in very critical areas,"" he said. Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback, as well as Republican Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah commended her selection. Former Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Obama's first choice for secretary of health and human services, withdrew on February 3 after controversy erupted over his tax records and over his work in a field that some consider lobbying.",0.68529654,3526
79,"(CNN)  -- Responding to President Obama's State of the Union comments about the ""deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that ""the American people don't care about process."" Yet Americans have indicated that they are quite unhappy with how their government is working. According to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, only 28 percent of those polled believe that the federal government is ""working well,"" while seven out of 10 believe that the ""unhealthy"" government is in need of reform. Almost 93 percent said there was too much partisanship; 84 percent said special interests had excessive power. We must always take these kinds of poll numbers with a grain of salt. Polls frequently show that Americans do not like how their government works, especially Congress. The U.S. is a country that has always expressed strong distrust of government. There have been a few exceptional periods, like the progressive era or the 1960s and 1970s, when this frustration turns into a concerted movement for government reform. During the 1960s and 1970s, liberal Democrats and Republicans concluded that much of their policy agenda would be impossible to achieve if the political process did not change. They perceived Vietnam and then Watergate as the outgrowth of deep flaws in how our government worked. During the 1970s, they were able to pass a series of significant reforms, such as a campaign finance system that included public funds for presidential campaigns and contribution limits. Reforms opened up more of the political process through sunshine laws and retrenched the power of the senior committee chairmen in Congress who had usually done as they pleased, ignoring the will of the majority. Ethics laws regulated the behavior of executive and legislative branch. Even the sacrosanct filibuster underwent an overhaul in 1975: The Senate lowered the number of required to end a filibuster from two-thirds of the Senate, 67; to three-fifths, 60. Many of the reforms did not work, some had unintended consequences, and others were gradually unraveled. But substantive reform was possible and, for a moment, changed the way that politics as usual worked. In addition to diminishing citizens' trust in government, the flaws of the political process constrain and limit what kinds of policies are even possible. If President Obama, Democrats and Republicans are serious about building trust among citizens and creating a more productive political process, they should work together to do something about it. If Washington is serious about reforming the political process, three specific areas deserve immediate attention. Filibuster reform: The 60-vote supermajority Senate has become dysfunctional. Both parties have expressed frustration with their inability to move legislation through the process. Both parties have used the filibuster as a normal tool of procedural warfare. Because of the rampant use of the filibuster since the 1960s, senators expect that 60 votes are now required on almost every piece of legislation. Reform can happen again. One option would be to switch to a majority-based system in which 51 votes can end debate. Another, more feasible, option would lower the number of senators required for cloture to 55. To improve the political prospects for any change, some observers have suggested that any reform would not take effect until after the 2012 election. Making it easier to end a filibuster is one of the most important concrete steps that Congress could take to actually diminish partisanship. The sources of partisanship are deep-rooted and hard to change. But filibuster reform would disarm both parties by weakening or removing one of their most powerful weapons. Campaign finance reform: A recent Supreme Court decision eliminated many of the barriers to corporate donations and third-party advertising. The power of private money in campaigns has been a huge political issue for over a century. Because politicians depend on interest group support to obtain funds for their campaigns, they constantly find themselves constrained when it comes to making policy. The influence of private money also diminishes public trust in government. Every story about another lobbyist like Jack Abramoff confirms their worst fears about corruption. It is not difficult to understand why Congress has crafted a health care bill that avoids making any huge changes to the basic infrastructure of the health care industry. According to The New York Times, citing the Center for Responsive Politics, the health care and insurance industry spent at least $648 million on lobbying in 2009 -- and 20 percent of the year-end reports were not in yet. Pharmaceutical companies spent about $245 million, which the Times said was more than any other single industry has ever spent lobbying on behalf of any issue. Several changes have been discussed in recent years. The administration has talked about placing certain kinds of fund-raising restrictions on companies that do business with the government. A second proposal is to build on local and state reforms by providing matching public funds to candidates who raise a certain minimum of private donations. In the end, offering an alternative source of funds to candidates and parties is the only way to change the system, or candidates will be forced to keep going back to the well of interest group money. Congressional earmarks and tax breaks: Pork-barrel politics is as American as apple pie. But in recent decades, the system by which legislators pass appropriations targeted to key interests has become pervasive. Legislators are comfortable putting provisions that are tailor-made for lobbyists or particular interests into bills. These earmarks are not subject to hearings or oversight. The use of earmarks by Senate Democrats to close the health care legislation that passed last month made the public uneasy. The other way in which Congress distributes hidden benefits is through tax breaks. During the 1960s, reformers named these ""tax expenditures"" to convey the point that the government essentially spends money by forgiving certain groups of their obligation. We have not had a major tax reform initiative since 1986. The time has come to clean out the tax code once again and reduce the number of provisions that are in the law. There is also bipartisan support for reforms that would limit the use of earmarks by legislators and make certain that they are fully disclosed upon being requested. Although voters tend to be more interested in bread-and-butter issues, as well as questions about war and peace, there are a few exceptional moments when public anger about the political system becomes so intense that we enter into a period of substantive reform. We might be reaching one of those points, but in the end it will require the initiative of the president and congressional leaders to make sure that calls for reform are not just empty rhetoric.

80,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Obama administration is abandoning a controversial plan to charge private insurers for treatment of veterans' service-connected ailments. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel met with veterans' groups on Wednesday. In an statement Wednesday night, the White House said that although the president believes the plan would raise more money for veterans' care, the administration is dropping the idea after hearing the objections of veterans groups. ""The President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs [veterans service organizations] that this might, under certain circumstances, affect veterans and their families' ability to access health care,"" the White House said. ""Therefore, the president has instructed that its consideration be dropped."" News of the change of heart originally came from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who disclosed the decision to reporters while meeting with a group of veterans on Capitol Hill. ""President Obama has listened to the concerns expressed by veterans' leaders and veterans' service organizations,"" Pelosi said. ""We will leave no veteran behind."" Veterans' representatives and members of Congress have angrily opposed the proposal, which White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said was never finalized. Leaders from 11 veterans groups discussed their position in a meeting Wednesday afternoon with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. ""We stood firm on our stance that there is no way to support charging veterans' insurance companies for service-connected treatment,"" said Jim King, executive director of AMVETS, a leading veterans' advocacy organization. Emanuel indicated that the proposal was ""a dead issue,"" King added. ""The administration was quick to say [that if veterans were] going to fight it, [the White House wasn't] going to push it."" Another attendee, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff, said Emanuel was quick to come back after hearing the veterans' groups stand firm and tell them, ""Let's clarify, it is dead."" ""They made the right move -- they listened to us. Now we can move on to bigger more important issues,"" Rieckhoff said. The meeting was very short, said King. Despite the difference in opinion, King said the atmosphere was cordial and ""everybody seemed comfortable."" On Monday, the groups met with President Obama, Emanuel, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki and Steven Kosiak, director in charge of defense spending for the Office of Management and Budget. The administration saw the plan as a way of raising more than $500 million in revenues for the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, veterans groups saw it is a violation of what they said is the government's moral obligation to treat veterans injured during service to their country. In addition, they believed it would lead to veterans and their families losing their private insurance or premiums rising because of the high costs of treating many service-related injuries. The head of the Senate Veterans Affairs committee, Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, said Tuesday his committee would ""not advance any such legislation."" His counterpart in the House, Bob Filner, D-California, said his committee wouldn't take up the proposal either. In a statement released by his office, Filner said the idea is ""DOA"" and said the budget ""cannot be balanced on the backs (or legs, or kidneys, or hearts) of our nation's combat-wounded heroes."" The president pushed back during the meeting on Monday, telling the groups that private insurance companies were getting a free ride. He challenged the veterans to come up with an alternative way to raise revenues. AMVETS planned to propose that billings be pursued more aggressively for injuries not related to service. But AMVETS director King said Emanuel didn't ask for suggestions in Wednesday's meeting. A 2008 Government Accountability Office study found that about $1.7 billion in treatment that could have been charged to private insurance never was, nor was it collected by the VA.

81,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Shouting from the audience. Holding up signs blasting the health care reform bill before Congress. Frequent hissing and booing. Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama. Though it sounds like behavior at one of the health care town hall meetings last month, it was how some Republicans reacted to President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night. But Norm Ornstein, a longtime observer of Congress and an expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said the tone and behavior from members of Congress are not necessarily new. ""A lot of what went on [Wednesday] night has become fairly typical of what we've seen in the State of the Union messages over the last 10 or 12 years, where it's one side jumping up wildly and the other side sitting on their hands in stony silence."" The most memorable moment came from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, who shouted ""You lie"" after the president said that a Democratic-sponsored health care bill would not cover illegal immigrants. Ornstein said that in addition to being beyond the bounds of what is typical, Wilson's comment is ""just sort of stunning in the level of disrespect for not just the president but the presidency.""  Watch more of Wilson's outburst » . During several moments in Obama's speech, members of the GOP hissed and yelled at the president as he laid out his plan for reform. One Republican held a sign saying, ""What bill?"" House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, was seen several times typing on his phone during the speech. Vice President Joe Biden told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday that he was ""embarrassed for the chamber and a Congress I love."" Observers said the behavior is probably indicative of the vitriolic sentiments found during town hall meetings. ""I think a lot of those Republican members went home to their district and were met with very angry reaction from their constituents. Congress, as you know, is pretty polarized,"" said Kasie Hunt, a health care reporter for National Journal's Congress Daily. ""I think, in some ways, that's what you really saw last night: the degree of acceptance of that angry discord that we've really hadn't seen in a long time."" Hunt said there is still a lot of misunderstanding among Republican members of Congress. John O'Connor, who covers politics for The State newspaper in South Carolina, said that a lot of Wilson's anger mirrors what many feel in his home state. ""I think he feels the way a lot of people in South Carolina feel about [health care reform]. They're suspicious. They're worried. There's some fear out there about what could happen."" But O'Connor points out that South Carolina tends to be more conservative than other states, and Wilson's town halls were generally civil. ""Rep. Wilson, however, held a town hall meeting in Columbia where, for the most part, there was a pretty reasoned debate,"" he added. ""There were folks on both sides raising issues, asking questions."" Still, it might have been Wilson's constituents' anger and distrust that contributed to the outburst in Congress, O'Connor noted. ""His takeaway from that was that people support his stance, which was to oppose any version of what he's calling Obamacare,"" he said. ""So despite the fact that there was clearly some support in that audience for doing something about health care and health insurance, he kind of had a different impression of what the majority of the crowd thought."" Could Wilson face any trouble for his comments Wednesday night? Unlikely, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi said Thursday that there is a procedure that could have been implemented to strike Wilson's ""lie"" comment from the record. But she said the president did the right thing in continuing on and not giving it ""any more attention than it deserved."" Pelosi indicated that she would not press the issue farther. ""As far as I'm concerned, the episode was unfortunate. Mr. Wilson has apologized. It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson,"" she said. Political observers in South Carolina opine that the comment heard around the world ""was a little surprising."" ""This is not his personality. He's not a guy who tends to make a lot of inflammatory statements. You expect that a lot more from Rep. DeMint [Republican from South Carolina] than Wilson for sure,"" O'Connor added. Wilson said Thursday that his outburst was simply ""spontaneous.""  Watch Obama's full speech » . Meanwhile, the controversy surrounding him -- and anger on both sides of the aisle to his statement -- has helped his opponent in the 2010 midterm election. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Thursday afternoon that since Wilson's comment, his Democratic opponent, former Marine Rob Miller, received 11,000 individual grass-roots contributions and raised more than $400,000. During the 2008 election, when support for Democrats and Obama was high, Wilson faced a tough slog against Miller. The Republican, who represents the 2nd Congressional District, including most of Columbia and parts east, won 54 percent of the vote to Miller's 46 percent. Ornstein added that Wilson's comment was an ""incredibly dumb thing to do"" for the broader picture of the Republican Party. ""It was a gift, in a way, to Barack Obama,"" he said. ""To independent voters out there, this just underscored the notion that you've got a party that is unremittingly hostile to the president that has no interest in negotiating or finding common ground.""",0.67716587,6741
82,"(CNN)  -- We have met the enemy, and he is us. Debate on health care reform has once again become a miserable exhibition of seemingly irreconcilable differences, which President Obama is trying to address in his health care summit. There is a path forward, and it starts with understanding that waiting for the government to lead an uncertain reform effort isn't necessary. Prepaid integrated health systems like Kaiser Permanente, Geisinger Health System, Group Health Cooperative and HealthPartners are succeeding and innovative. It's no coincidence that these organizations are often mentioned when describing health care providers that offer high quality care while staying affordable. Legislators should encourage such proven successes and make them available to all Americans. Integrated health systems simply assume responsibility for both the financing and delivery of care, so they try to keep patients healthy and avoid costlier illnesses and hospitalizations down the road.  They are more likely to provide preventative care, such as vaccinations and cancer screening. Basically, the system we are all accustomed to in the United States separates insurance from the provision of care. That is, your doctor and hospital and your health insurance company are different institutions. This pits them against one another, because one wants to cut care whenever possible, while the other wants to provide as much care as possible, with little incentive to keep costs down. Integrated systems are simply both -- they are either  insurance companies who own their own hospitals and hire their own doctors or hospital and physician groups that offer a health plan. Other innovations routinely seen in integrated systems include digital medical records, direct electronic messaging with providers, instant access to health records and test results, telehealth and home-based medical services and affordable access to primary care. Many people are determined that the United States should emulate the rest of the industrialized world and adopt a publicly subsidized system of universal coverage. Admirers of these foreign systems point to their low costs and accessible primary care services, but they may be surprised to find that successful integrated health systems in this country are organized very similarly to the most admired state-sponsored systems found overseas. Whether taxpayers help fund an institution is not the main factor for success; rather, it is the integration between delivery and payment that creates an incentive to provide high-value care that keeps members healthy and out of hospitals. This is the mantra that guides care delivery in both the best-performing systems overseas and in prepaid integrated systems in the United States. Meanwhile, there are, of course, publicly supported health programs in the United States, including Medicare and Medicaid. Yet the same people who lament that a state-subsidized health care system would lay an unrelenting path to outright socialism hardly ever call  for a dismantling of Medicare. Whether that's because of political expediency or simple hypocrisy can be left to conjecture. What's important is that a high-performing, state-sponsored health institution already operates in the United States -- the Veterans Health Administration. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, however, the VA has a tightly integrated health care system that has managed to dramatically improve quality and introduce innovations, all while keeping costs in check. Killing off all state-sponsorship of health care in this country in a shortsighted resistance against progressivism would be a grave mistake. The bottom line is that we've been arguing over the wrong question. The best health care system isn't a matter of private vs. public, or us vs. them. The debate should be about how to foster a system that is organized in a way such that its utmost concern is providing value to its patients. There is no need to import a foreign system; we already have many similar systems in existence. The biggest hurdle is that, despite their advantages, integrated systems only serve about 5 percent of the population. Entrenched players in the health care industry stand opposed to integrated care. If legislators truly want to make health care better, they will encourage the development of more integrated systems so that everyone has access to multiple options in a competitive marketplace. Maintaining a vibrant, innovative private sector is critical, but we also can't ignore the success of many integrated, publicly subsidized systems abroad. Fostering the growth of our own integrated health systems in the private sector addresses the right question and offers the opportunity for us to have the best system of all.

83,"(CNN)  -- Be bold! Think big! Barack Obama wants to do just that. An $800 billion economic stimulus plan. Three million jobs. Health care reform. A restructured automobile industry. Obama's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents. Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years. His party made big gains in Congress. Democrats now have a majority of nearly 60 percent in both the House and Senate. President Obama's got a mandate. And a majority. What's to stop him? Just this: the U.S. system of government. It is set up to make it difficult to get things done. The Constitution was written 222 years ago by men who didn't trust government. They had just waged a revolution against a king. To the founders of the American republic, strong government meant despotism. So they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers. The idea was to ensure weak government. The dirty little secret of American government is that it was designed not to work very well. As president after president has discovered, there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed, even if the president's party holds a majority in Congress. The Senate has its own rule that's not in the Constitution requiring a super-majority of 60 Senate votes to control the agenda. A minority of 41 senators can ""filibuster'' a measure and prevent it from coming up for a vote. How many votes will Republicans have in the Senate? 41 or 42, depending on the outcome in Minnesota where ballots are still being counted. Presidents often have problems holding their own party together. That's because members of Congress are elected by local constituencies and they are expected to represent local interests. American politicians are independent political entrepreneurs. They are not foot-soldiers of a party. When Bill Clinton first became president, he had a solid Democratic majority in Congress. But he could not get his health care reform plan passed. After an intense advertising campaign by opponents, many Americans were worried that the Clintons were planning a government takeover of the health care system. The Clinton plan failed, and within two years, Democrats lost their majority in Congress. One-party control didn't work any better for George W. Bush. Bush had trouble getting what he wanted -- notably, immigration reform -- from a Republican Congress. Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 2006. But here's another dirty little secret of American government: it often does work. Very well in fact. Under the right conditions, barriers fall away and things get done, sometimes with amazing speed and efficiency. What are the right conditions? An overwhelming sense of public urgency. That sense of urgency certainly existed after 9/11, when Congress quickly passed the Patriot Act. Getting anything big done in American government requires a sense of crisis. That's why politicians in the U.S. are always declaring crises -- a drug crisis, an education crisis, an environmental crisis. Or they're trying to rally the country to fight a war on something -- a war on poverty, a war on crime. If the public urgency is not authentic, however, opponents won't have much trouble stopping things from happening. Obama certainly takes office at a time of crisis, just as Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt did. Like them, he has the opportunity to transform American government. Members of Congress who try to block President Obama's program may find themselves in political trouble. Because there is yet another dirty little secret of American government: the United States is the most populist democracy in the world. Here, the people rule. When the people want something, they will get it, whether it's the death penalty or gun rights or lower taxes. Why doesn't the United States have a metric system or dollar coins like other countries? Because the people won't use them. Obama's popularity is soaring right now. When a president is popular, he has clout. Everyone wants to be on his side, even members of the opposition party. They're in business for themselves, and supporting a popular president is good for business. Standing in his way could drive them out of business. American government is not an efficient, well-oiled machine. It was never designed to be. It has to be lubricated by public pressure. If the people are shouting ""Do something!'' -- as they are right now -- then something will happen. Even if it means a lot more spending and a lot more government. The people reserve one key right: they will let the government know, rather quickly, whether or not it's working.",0.6692442,3315
84,"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Across the country, insurance companies, trial lawyers and legislators are closely watching a November referendum in the state of Washington that could change how insurers are required to treat their customers. Insurance companies are using the referendum process to try to strike down a new law in Washington state. Insurance giants like Allstate, State Farm, Safeco and Farmers have poured more than $8 million into the referendum battle. Their goal is to convince voters to reject a law passed earlier this year that could force insurers to pay up to triple damages and lawyer fees if they fail to pay a legitimate claim and then lose in court. A ""yes"" vote on the referendum allows the law to go into effect while a ""no"" vote strikes the law down. Supporters of the law say it forces insurance companies to pay legitimate claims in a timely and fair fashion and frees the courts from relatively minor cases that clog the system for months and even years. One supporter, the Washington Trial Lawyers Association, has raised almost $900,000 to fight the insurance industry over the referendum. ""Insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they don't pay your claim,'' said Washington state Rep. Steve Kirby. Kirby and his fellow Washington state lawmakers heard so many complaints from policy holders who believed insurers weren't treating them fairly that earlier this year they passed a law called ""The Fair Conduct Act."" Hearings were held, the bill was revised -- even watered down, according to Kirby -- and both the House and Senate passed it. The governor readily signed it. But the very next day a coalition, funded primarily by insurance companies, moved in to stop the law from going into effect by filing petitions for a voter referendum on the law. Representatives of the insurance industry say the law will raise premiums and that the system is working fine as it is. The law, they said, will only make things worse, and they want voters to have the final say. ""The insurance companies stepped in and said, 'Consumers, you get to decide if you want to do this,' '' said Dana Childers, executive director of the Liability Reform Coalition, which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law. Childers said the state's own insurance commissioner sees no need for the law. ""His own information that he provided to the legislature and the public says that this law simply isn't necessary,'' Childers said. But that's not what Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler told CNN in a recent interview in Seattle. Kreidler said he strongly supports the new law and that if insurance companies act responsibly they have nothing to fear. ""If companies act in good faith, [they are] not going to have a problem,"" Kreidler said. ""It's not going to cost any more money. There's not going to be any legal action. There's going to be no treble damages, because if companies deal with their customers in good faith there's no penalty."" The campaign to woo voters has already begun. The insurance industry-backed group is already running television commercials depicting greedy lawyers planning to sue and warning consumers that the law will lead to frivolous lawsuits and higher rates. It's not a new tactic by the insurance companies. Earlier this year, CNN exposed a controversial insurance industry strategy that began in the mid-1990s. Former insiders say insurance companies began limiting or denying legitimate claims in minor injury cases and reaped billions in profits as a result. The strategy has tied up courts across the country -- over minor claims, judges told CNN -- for months and even years. How did they do it? ""It really came down to basically three elements: a position of delay, a position of denying a claim and ultimately defending that claim that you're denied,"" said Jim Mathis, a former insurance industry insider. But Robert Hartwig, with the industry-backed Insurance Institute, said the strategy was not intended to deny valid claims but to attack fraud, which, he claimed earlier this year, was rampant in minor accident cases. ""What insurers are doing is trying to monitor costs. And every insurance company is under the same pressure to do it,"" Hartwig said. Washington state resident Michelle Tribble plans to vote for the law because she says she has experienced the strategy first-hand. She says her two accidents convinced her insurance companies don't want to play fair. Tribble was working for an insurance company when she got rear-ended on the freeway. Ten weeks later she got hit again, this time by an uninsured motorist. The two accidents, she said, resulted in back injuries that required medical treatment. The first company agreed to pay but her own insurer, Allstate, refused to pay even though she had coverage. ""I just wanted my medical bills paid because I didn't want my credit being hurt,'' Tribble said, adding that the total came to about $18,000. She said Allstate dug into her medical past. ""They brought out stacks of medical records, you know, to see if I was at all deceptive."" An arbitrator sided with Tribble, but Allstate refused to pay. The case went to court, where a jury, too, ruled for Tribble. But Allstate appealed again. Finally, four years after the accident, the company paid her claim. Allstate said it could not comment on individual claims but said cases like Tribble's prove ""that the current judicial system is working."" E-mail to a friend .",0.66381603,6118
85,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Veterans groups are warning President Barack Obama against going ahead with a possible administration move to charge veterans' private health care for service-related injuries. Veterans groups say it's ""wholly unacceptable"" to charge their private insurance for service injuries. In a letter sent by 11 of the most prominent veterans organizations, the groups warned that the idea ""is wholly unacceptable and a total abrogation of our government's moral and legal responsibility to the men and women who have sacrificed so much."" CNN obtained a copy of the letter sent to the White House last Friday by groups including The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Read the letter (PDF) A White House spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the option is being considered. ""The details of specific proposals will be transmitted with the full submission in April. The president has made it clear that meeting the needs of veterans is one of his priorities, and as a result has requested an 11 percent increase in discretionary funding for 2010, and the administration is actively working with the veterans community to ensure we get the details of this budget right,"" said White House spokesman Nick Shapiro. In the letter, the groups said they have been told by sources on Capitol Hill and at the VA that the idea under consideration would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to bill health insurance for a treatment of a disability or injury that was a result of military service. The argument for the proposal is that it frees up money for the VA by charging the private insurers, allowing the VA to spend on more services, said Joe Violante, legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, who opposes the idea. While there could be savings, Violante warned it also could lead to an increase in premiums for veterans with private coverage. """"We cannot and would not agree to any proposal that would expand this concept any further,"" the heads of the 11 groups wrote in the letter. ""While we understand the fiscal difficulties this country faces right now, placing the burden of those fiscal problems on the men and women who have already sacrificed a great deal for this country is unconscionable."" Currently, veterans' private insurance is only charged when they receive health care from the VA for medical issues that are not related to service injuries, like getting the flu. Charging for service-related injuries would violate ""a sacred trust,"" said Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis. Davis said the move would risk private health care for veterans and their families by potentially maxing out benefits paying for costly war injury treatments. It could also make it harder for veterans to get private insurance if the companies decide to reject them for pre-existing conditions, rather than be billed for service-connected injuries, Davis said. ""This seems like bad politics and bad policy,"" said IAVA Policy Director Vanessa Williamson, noting that every veterans group opposes it and warns it will adversely affect veterans. ""I don't see this as a tenable option.""",0.663326,3735
86,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A top congressional Republican on Sunday criticized President Barack Obama's expected decision to reverse the Bush administration's limits on embryonic stem-cell research, calling it a distraction from the country's economic slump. U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor also says the policy reversal could lead to embryo harvesting, which ""shouldn't be done."" ""Why are we going and distracting ourselves from the economy? This is job No. 1. Let's focus on what needs to be done,"" Rep. Eric Cantor, the Republican whip in the House of Representatives, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" Obama's move, scheduled for Monday morning, is part of a broader effort to separate science and politics and ""restore scientific integrity in governmental decision-making,"" White House domestic policy adviser Melody Barnes said Sunday. The Bush administration's 2001 policy bars federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells beyond the cell lines that existed at the time. Cantor, R-Virginia, has been among the leaders of GOP opposition to Obama's economic policies. In a conference call with reporters, Barnes said funding research is also part of the administration's plan to boost the plunging U.S. economy. ""Advances with regard to science and technology help advance our overall national goals around economic growth and job creation,"" she said, adding, ""I think anytime you make an effort to try and separate these pieces of the puzzle, you're missing the entire picture."" Because stem cells have the potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body, research advocates say they could yield cures to debilitating conditions such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. But because work on embryonic stem cells involves the destruction of human embryos, many conservatives supported the limits former President George Bush imposed by executive order in 2001. ""Frankly, federal funding of embryonic stem-cell research can bring on embryo harvesting, perhaps even human cloning that occurs,"" Cantor said. ""We don't want that. That shouldn't be done. That's wrong."" The Bush policy limited federal funding to work on 60 existing stem-cell lines, but only 21 of those have proven useful to researchers. Congress voted to roll back those limits in 2006 and 2007, but Bush vetoed the legislation both times, leading to Democratic charges that he had put politics over science. Dr. Harold Varmus, president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and co-chairman of Obama's science advisory council, said Sunday that Obama will ""endorse the notion that public policy must be guided by sound, scientific advice."" Obama's order will direct the National Institutes of Health to develop revised guidelines on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research within 120 days, said Varmus, who joined Barnes in the conference call with reporters. ""The president is, in effect, allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it's permitted by law -- that is, work with stem cells themselves, not the derivation of stem cells,"" he said. Supporters of the ban said researchers could still obtain private funding or explore alternatives such as adult stem cells. Opponents said the research could be carried out using embryos left over in fertility clinics, which otherwise would be discarded. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, told reporters that reversing the Bush ban would ""once again say to the rest of the world that we will be the beacon for cures and for hope."" She credited her support for federal funding in part for her 2006 election. ""I think it's a great moment, and I'm proud of [Obama] for reversing that executive order,"" McCaskill said. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, said the Bush policy imposed ethical limits on science. ""My basic tenet here is I don't think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth,"" Shelby said. ""I know that people argue there are other ways. I think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can, but we should have some ethics about it."" CNN's Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.",0.6616956,2008

88,"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to North Carolina to look at the financial crisis' impact on health care. Doug Pegram, of North Carolina, is one of many unemployed Americans struggling with medical bills. WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina (CNN) -- For Doug Pegram, it is on the one hand simple math: His medical bills cost roughly $300 a month and a health insurance policy would cost $550. ""Two or three hundred dollars goes a long way,"" Pegram said. Especially when you are living on unemployment benefits. Simple math, and a huge gamble: Pegram has a rare disorder, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, that in some patients can be life-threatening. ""If anything happens, that's another story,"" Pegram told us. ""But you have to do what you have to do sometimes, and you just hope for the best. And do it.""  Watch Pegram describe his tough choices » . Life on the edge started in November, when Pegram lost his job at Hanesbrands Inc., the clothing manufacturer where he had worked for three years. Ironically, Pegram's job as a senior analyst included writing reports for Hanes management on sales and economic trends. ""Every couple months, it [layoffs] went through the company and a few people here and there and it got worse and worse,"" he said. ""I knew it was in the future somewhere."" Now, he is looking for a job and keeping his fingers crossed his condition doesn't worsen. Ehlers-Danlos is a group of inherited disorders that affect connective tissues. In Pegram's case, it means constant pain in his legs and some other joints. ""One type is you can have heart failure if you don't get checked out, so it's pretty serious that you actually go to the doctor,"" Pegram said. His monthly visit costs $150 -- and patients like Pegram who are without insurance are asked to pay up front. His medications run about $126 at a discount pharmacy. Pegram has old bills showing that when he was at Hanes and insured, the same medication cost the insurance company $68 because of its discount. His doctor also accepted a lower negotiated rate from the insurer. ""So everything is inflated,"" he said of his medical costs now. He could have signed up for the COBRA health coverage available to workers as they lose their jobs. It was that policy Pegram said would have cost him $550 or ""almost half of what you get every month"" in jobless benefits and leave him ""not able to pay for a place to live, and food, and all that.""  Watch President Obama's summit on health care » . In an interview at his condo, we asked Pegram: ""Should you be doing more? If you had insurance, would you be doing more, seeing more doctors?"" ""Yes, I would be."" ""And what's the risk of not doing that?"" ""I could go downhill quicker. It's a debilitating condition, so eventually I could, I don't know."" Yet he is remarkably upbeat about his health and about the prospects of finding a job before his benefits run out in a few months. ""I think I will find something before then,"" Pegram said, while conceding he might be forced soon to lower his sights and look for work that pays less than his Hanes position as long as it provides health care coverage. The jobless rate in the Winston-Salem metropolitan area was 7.6 percent in December 2008, up from 4.4 percent one year earlier. With the higher unemployment comes increases in the number of residents without health insurance. Dr. Bruce Wham has been a practicing dentist for 26 years and an amateur economist for the past year or so. ""Most people feel like it is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Wham said when we visited his practice. ""Talking to patients, talking about automobile purchases, any kind of renovations of houses, even education -- sending their kids to college, there is a lot of concern about purchasing those things or how they are going to do those things and dentistry is sometimes considered more of a luxury than a necessity and we get pushed to the back lot."" One way Wham can tell if a longtime patient is about to lose his or her job is if they suddenly schedule treatments and repairs they had been putting off. It is a sign they are about to lose their insurance coverage. ""Especially if there is something that they need to get done or have been 'treatment-planned' for and they have been told by the dentist, the hygienist, to replace this, yes, they are more likely to want to come in and get that done as soon as they can,"" Wham said. The flip side: A patient who needs major work who instead endures the pain, or asks Wham if there is a cheaper, though perhaps temporary, solution. ""If there is anything that can be delayed or pushed back, that is what they are doing. They are asking us, 'Is there any way that we can hold off? Is there anything less involved, less costly until I get my job, until I know my insurance is going to be back?' in effect. ""And so we do a lot of that, not necessarily temporary restorations, but things that might not last as long and that may not be as costly to try to tide people over for the short term."" So it maybe is not in the best interest of the patient in the long term, but maybe better on their wallet in the short term? ""Better on their wallet. That is exactly right.""",0.655747,2779
89,"(CNN) -- Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer says he was the Republican House member who called out ""baby killer"" during the chamber's debate Sunday night on the health care reform bill. Neugebauer issued a statement Monday apologizing for the outburst. His statement said he called out, ""It's a baby killer,"" in reference to the last-minute deal between Michigan Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak and the White House that secured the support of Stupak and other anti-abortion Democrats for the health care bill. ""Last night was the climax of weeks and months of debate on a health care bill that my constituents fear and do not support,"" Neugebauer's statement said. ""In the heat and emotion of the debate, I exclaimed the phrase 'it's a baby killer' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership."" The interruption occurred as Stupak was delivering an emotional speech defending the deal with the White House that called for President Obama to issue an executive order guaranteeing that the bill would not change existing limits on federal funding for abortion. The phrase yelled by Neugebauer was initially believed to have been directed at Stupak personally. ""While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn, I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself,"" Neugebauer's statement said. ""I have apologized to Mr. Stupak and also apologize to my colleagues for the manner in which I expressed my disappointment about the bill,"" the statement concluded. ""The House Chamber is a place of decorum and respect. The timing and tone of my comment last night was inappropriate."" The incident evoked memories of Rep.

90,"(CNN) -- Sometimes it seems like Barack Obama rules the Internet. President Obama speaks during a town hall meeting on health care in August. The president's Twitter feed is hugely popular, with more than 2 million followers. Funny White House photos of the first family wearing 3-D glasses went viral after the White House posted them to Flickr. And he's the first president who commonly addresses the nation on YouTube. Many pundits have argued Obama's mastery of online social networks and his image as a BlackBerry-addicted, tech-hip person helped win him the U.S. presidency in January. So if the Obama Administration is so Internet savvy, what's happening with health care? As the country's messy debate about health care reform continues, some online observers are starting to wonder if Obama has lost his grip on Internet discourse. They're also wondering if it's possible for any one person -- no matter how powerful -- to control public dialogue on a medium like the Internet, where conversations are driven by millions of users instead of TV pundits and heads of state. The health care fight is the first time the U.S. has had a major policy debate where all sides are represented and haggling openly online, said Joe Trippi, author of ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Democracy, the Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything."" Obama's success at mobilizing grass-roots support through online networks has inspired Republicans and interests groups to do the same, he said. That may give the impression that Obama is losing control of his online base, but it really means more people are conversing online, he said. ""You're definitely seeing a diversity of voices and a diversity of opinions [online] that I think is due to Obama's success,"" said Trippi, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist. ""It's the great awakening. People realized they need to do that too."" Partly because of the vastness of opinion and discussion online, it's difficult for the Obama administration, or any single group, to control the health care debate, said David All, founder of TechRepublican.com. All said Democrats have made a number of ""online gaffes"" that have drawn attention away from their talking points. He said there is ""so much noise"" in the health care debate online that the party's missteps are overshadowing its message. For example, the White House raised privacy concerns after it asked people to send the administration e-mails and online writings that spread misinformation about health care reform, he said. Still, Obama remains active on many social networks -- from Twitter to Facebook to the video-sharing site Vimeo. And some people say he's still doing a fine job at being an up-to-date online communicator. Mark Milian, a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times who has written about Obama and social media, said Obama's online communications fell off when he first took office. But he says the president has rebounded online during the health care debate and is doing a good job of reaching constituents through that medium. But that doesn't mean he's the only one talking online. In trying to get their message across, administration officials have ""just as good a shot as some 20-year-old college student from Chicago,"" he said. ""It's just they have more people behind that issue. They have a greater pull."" Some have criticized the online community and Internet spin-masters for creating, and spreading, disinformation about proposals for health care reform. On the whole, though, the Internet conversation about the subject is healthy in part because so much information is available, said Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact.com, a nonpartisan site that fact-checks political statements. ""People have access now to more information than ever before and that's generally a very positive thing,"" he said. ""Although the Internet can be used to spread a lot of false things, it's also never been easier for journalists like myself to debunk these things, you know? So on balance, the reality is we just have a whole new dimension to the national discussion on any topic and that has positives and negatives."" He encouraged people to check out statements made by bloggers, Twitter users or e-mailers before considering them fact. Prevailing images of the recent health care debate have been of constituents screaming at their legislators in a series of town hall meetings held around the county. Bernhard Drax, who has reported on health care meetings in the virtual world of Second Life, said conversations online have the potential to be much more civil and productive than those real-world town halls. ""Social media could drown them out with reason, with substance,"" he said. ""My idealistic view is that social media in general, including virtual worlds, can drown out that angry shouting."" Daniel Palestrant, CEO of Sermo, an online social network for doctors, said Internet discussions tend to be ahead of those in the real world. Tort reform, he said, wouldn't be in the public conversation if not for the fact that people can bring up that issue up on the Web. He added that medical associations claim to represent physicians but often don't portray the nuances of peoples' views. The Internet lets people speak for themselves, he said. Trippi, the campaign consultant, said the shouting matches at health care town halls expose the limitations of online discourse today. But he said online debates and discussions will play increasingly important roles in public policy discussions. ""All these new tools are still just in their infancy and they're still being used to a large extent just like everything else is used,"" he said. ""But I don't think that will hold. I think you're starting to see people actually talking to each other.""",0.6501264,8643
91,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Participation in government health insurance programs -- particularly those aimed at children -- increased from 2006 to 2007, leading to a decrease in the number of Americans lacking insurance, the U.S. Census Bureau said Tuesday. The Census Bureau says 15.3 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in 2007. Overall, 45.7 million people, or 15.3 percent of U.S. residents, did not have health insurance in 2007, the bureau said in releasing reports on poverty, income and insurance. That represents a decrease from the 2006 level of 47 million, or 15.8 percent. The decrease came as a surprise, as the number of uninsured Americans had been expected to rise for a seventh straight year. It also gives a boost to proponents of expanding government health-care plans such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. In December, President Bush signed legislation that extends SCHIP federal funding through the end of March 2009. That action came after Bush vetoed two congressional attempts to expand the program. In vetoing one of the measures, Bush said the proposed expansion ""moves our country's health-care system in the wrong direction."" The percentages of people covered by private health insurance and by employment-based health insurance both decreased slightly in 2007, the Census numbers showed, although the number of those covered by employment-based insurance, 177.4 million, was not statistically different from 2006. However, the percentage of people, including children, covered by government health insurance programs increased to 27.8 percent in 2007 from 27 percent in 2006. The number of children under 18 without health insurance fell to 11 percent, or 8.1 million -- lower than the 2006 numbers of 11.1 percent and 8.7 million.  See a state-by-state breakdown of uninsured Americans » . Meanwhile, participation in Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income Americans, increased to 13.2 percent and 39.6 million in 2007, up from 12.9 percent and 38.3 million in 2006. Using a three-year average from 2005-2007, data showed that Texas had the highest percentage of uninsured, with 24.4 percent, the bureau said. With 8.3 percent, Massachusetts and Hawaii had the lowest estimates for uninsured rates, according to the Census Bureau, but the two were not statistically different from Minnesota (8.5 percent), Wisconsin (8.8 percent) and Iowa (9.4 percent). Hawaii also did not differ statistically from Maine (9.5 percent), it said. But ""even with the overall drop in uninsured Americans, the 45.7 million uninsured number for 2007 exceeds the combined population of 24 states plus the District of Columbia,"" a group called Families USA said in a written statement. The group says on its Web site it is ""dedicated to the achievement of high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans."" Being uninsured is a stark reality many Americans live with daily. They include Linda Pendleton of Greensboro, North Carolina. Pendleton was unable to afford private coverage when the convenience store where she worked stopped offering insurance to its employees two years ago. It worked out fine, she said, until she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer last month. Unable to work, she moved in with her daughter and her three grandsons. She has applied for Medicaid and disability, but has yet to receive a response. ""So right now I'm trying to pay for everything,"" said her daughter, Randi Sharp. But that's not easy. With two of her sons disabled, Sharp stays at home to care for them. Her eldest son receives disability payments of $632 per month, which supports the family, she said. The father of Sharp's children is supposed to pay support, but ""he up and left and the court can't find him."" Though her monthly rent is $600, Sharp said her landlord has cut her some slack. And she goes to churches for her food and didn't buy her sons school clothes this year, she said. Meanwhile, her mother is so dragged down by her reaction to the chemotherapy that she ""can barely do things for herself,"" Sharp said. And even relatively modest fees threaten to cut short her mother's chemotherapy treatments. ""If I don't give them cash on Thursday, if I don't give them $70, they're not going to see her any more,"" Sharp said. A yard sale over the weekend and trips to the pawn shop have helped. So does cutting back on food. ""There are days I go without even eating for two or three days,"" she said. ""I've exhausted all of our resources."" And while the number of those living without health insurance is down, one economist points out, ""we're still seeing an unraveling of the private health insurance system."" Overall, insurance premiums have continued to rise faster than wages or inflation, putting the squeeze on companies and on individual families, said Elise Gould, an economist at the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute. With 2007 being an economic peak year, ""you'd think some of the economy would have helped our workers,"" she said. ""We're not seeing that."" Another underlying problem, she said, is that people purchase cheaper insurance but often have substandard coverage -- something they often don't find out until they experience a health-care emergency and must pay a large amount out of pocket. Ron Pollack, executive director of Washington-based Families USA, issued a statement saying, ""It is ironic that, at the very time the Bush administration tried to cut back Medicaid and twice vetoed legislation to extend children's health coverage, the public safety net cushioned the loss of employer-sponsored health coverage. It demonstrates the importance that the next president should protect, and not undermine, the public health safety net."" Although the uninsured rate for children living below the federal poverty level decreased to 17.6 percent in 2007 from 19.3 percent in 2006, children in poverty were more likely to be uninsured than all children, the Census numbers showed. Still, the numbers of uninsured children decreased across all ethnic groups. However, people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as ""uninsured"" by the Census Bureau, meaning the actual number could be higher. In other data, the real median household income increased 1.3 percent nationwide, reaching $50,233, the Census Bureau said. The official poverty rate remained statistically unchanged, although the number slightly increased -- 37.3 Americans lived below the poverty level in 2007, up from 36.5 million in 2006. African-American households had the lowest median income, with $33,916, compared with $54,920 for non-Hispanic white households, the data showed. The median income for Hispanic households was $38,679. Household income rose in the Midwest and South, declined in the Northeast and remained unchanged in the West, the bureau said. As defined by the Office of Management and Budget and updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, the Census Bureau put the weighted average poverty threshold for 2007 at $21,203 for a family of four; $26,530 for a family of three; $13,540 for a family of two; and $10,590 for individuals. Working women earned 78 percent of the corresponding male salaries, according to the bureau. Median earnings increased for both men and women following three years of decline.

From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care Address . AZUZ: First up, health care reform reclaims the spotlight as President Obama takes up the issue in a speech to Congress. This debate has been heating up for months, with politicians and citizens weighing in with their opinions. It's an incredibly complicated issue, so we're gonna look at some of the main points right now. Some people think the country's health care system is fine the way it is. Others think it's broken, but what they don't agree on is how to fix it. For example, how much would it cost to reform the system, and where would that money come from? Should there be a government-run health insurance program? And if so, how might that impact private insurance companies? Those are just a few of the questions facing lawmakers. President Obama says he isn't the first president to take on health care, but he hopes to be the last. He's been pushing for reform since he took office, and he believes the time for action is now. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care. Health Care Response . AZUZ: After the president wrapped up his address to Congress, the Republican Party offered a response from U.S. Representative Charles Boustany. The Louisiana representative, who has more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon, says he agrees with parts of President Obama's plan. But he thinks it also presents several problems. Last night, he outlined some alternative ideas about how to improve the health care system and how to lower its costs. REP. CHARLES BOUSTANY JR, (R) LOUISIANA: We need to establish tough liability reform standards, encourage speedy resolution of claims, and deter junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of care. Real reform must do this. Let's also talk about letting families and businesses buy insurance across state lines. I and many other Republicans believe that that will provide real choice and competition to lower the cost of health insurance. Shoutout . GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Stephen Breyer, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas are all members of what governmental body? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Congress, B) The U.S. Supreme Court, C) President Obama's Cabinet or D) The Federal Reserve? You've got three seconds -- GO! Along with six other justices, these people compose the U.S. Supreme Court. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Campaign Finance . AZUZ: It's their job to interpret our country's laws, and one case the justices are looking at right now could have a major impact on elections, including the ones coming up next year! It's all about how much money corporations can give to candidates. Right now, there's a limit on that, but some people argue that violates the Constitution. Elaine Quijano is on the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FROM CITIZENS UNITED AD FOR ""HILLARY, THE MOVIE"": Who is Hillary Clinton? ELAINE QUIJANO, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: It started small. During last year's presidential primaries, a federal court said campaign finance laws barred this ad for an anti-Hillary Clinton movie by an advocacy group, a non-profit corporation. FROM CITIZENS UNITED AD FOR ""HILLARY, THE MOVIE"": If you thought you knew everything about Hillary Clinton, wait 'til you see the movie. QUIJANO: But now, the Supreme Court could make a monumental change in how money influences politics, deciding, in the name of free speech, whether there should be any limits at all on corporate campaign spending. FRED WERTHEIMER, DEMOCRACY 21, CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM SUPPORTER: Allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy. QUIJANO: Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 warns overturning a century of precedents would shut average citizens out of the political process. WERTHEIMER: The little guy would have no role here, because the dominant force in our politics, the dominant force in Washington decision-making, would become corporations. QUIJANO: But David Bossee of Citizens United, the group behind the anti-Hillary Clinton movie, argues that anyone pooling resources, including unions, the health industry, advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association, has free speech rights. DAVID BOSSEE, CITIZENS UNITED: I actually went out and looked for this fight, because I don't believe the government should have the right to impede people's entry into the process. And that's what the Federal Election Commission is trying to do here, squelch our first Amendment Rights. QUIJANO: Interestingly, the American Civil Liberties Union agrees. A final ruling is expected in a couple of months, and legal observers say conservatives could hold the key, with enough votes to possibly declare much of current campaign finance law unconstitutional. Elaine Quijano, CNN, the Supreme Court. (END VIDEO CLIP) Flash Flooding . AZUZ: Six months' worth of rain in two days! That is what residents in parts of Turkey are dealing with. This massive downpour triggered flash floods in the country this week, claiming more than 30 lives. In this video - look at this - you can see how the water rushed through a low-lying valley. It flipped and ripped up dozens of cargo trucks. Hundreds of other vehicles were washed out into the sea. The country's prime minister said emergency workers rescued around 1,300 people from the floods. He's already pledged money to get help and relief to the affected regions that need it. I.D. Me . RAMSAY: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a rock band originally from Liverpool, England. I made my first U.S. appearance in 1964. 20 of my songs landed at number 1 on the U.S. charts. And I was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. I'm the Beatles: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr! The Beatles: Rock Band . AZUZ: They were a rock band. Now the Beatles are in Rock Band! A new game featuring the famous Fab Four is out this week. It lets players jam out on dozens of the group's biggest hits. Plus, it gives younger audiences -- you -- a chance to check out some of rock and roll's most famous songs nearly four decades after the band's last gig. That's not the only reason the Beatles are back in the spotlight. All 15 of their albums have been re-mastered and put back on store shelves. Purifying Invention . AZUZ: Meanwhile, a famous inventor wants to do some re-mastering of his own. But we're not talking about digital, we're talking liquid. More than a billion people around the globe don't have access to clean drinking water. Sure, there're water water everywhere, but if it's not clean, it can cause serious consequences. Gary Tuchman looks at one idea designed to quench the problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Water: It's the most abundant resource on the planet, yet every year, millions of people die because they don't have access to clean water. So Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway, decided to take this problem on with a machine he calls the ""Slingshot."" DEAN KAMEN, INVENTOR: We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its goliath of a problem: bad water. TUCHMAN: He says the machine can turn contaminated water like this dirty river water into clean drinking water by boiling, distilling and vaporizing it. KAMEN: In goes the bad, and as you can see, out comes the good. That is pure water. TUCHMAN: The machine is smaller than some other water purifying systems, making it more portable. KAMEN: It's ideally suited to go to places in the developing world. TUCHMAN: Kamen says it requires very little electricity and maintenance to function. But until he finds partners and distributors to keep costs down, Slingshots won't be available to the people who need them most. KAMEN: We've got to find better strategies to deal with this incredibly unique and valuable resource called water, that we've all come to take for granted, but we'll not be able to do that in the future. TUCHMAN: Gary Tuchman, CNN. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we leave you today, we've got a story about something that's pretty darn fast. Usian Bolt may be the quickest person on the planet, but he's got nothing on Sarah. The cheetah charged into the record books yesterday as the world's fastest land mammal. She made the 100-meter dash in 6.16 seconds. Then she went out and shaved some more time off in her second attempt. Now for reference, sprinter Usain Bolt did it in 9.58 seconds. So, cheetah wins.

93,"Editor's note: Ted Epperly, M.D., a family physician in Boise, Idaho, is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, which represents more than 93,000 physicians and medical students nationwide. He spent 21 years in the U.S. Army, including service as a family physician, chief of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital emergency room during Desert Storm and Desert Shield, and deputy commander of an Army medical center. Ted Epperly says recruiting more primary care doctors would improve access to quality health care. (CNN) --   Clayton Christensen, Jason Hwang and Vineeta Vijayaraghavan are right about one thing in their CNN commentary titled ""We don't need more doctors.""  America's health care system is broken. It requires significant reform if patients are to have access to convenient, affordable and -- most importantly -- high-quality care that results in good outcomes. But they have missed a central point. We need more primary care physicians now and we will need even more in the future as the baby boom generation ages. If Americans are to see meaningful health care reform, they must have a primary care doctor to whom they can turn for everyday problems: annual physicals and preventive care, diagnosis and treatment for common illness, and diagnosis and treatment of complex, chronic conditions, referral to subspecialists, and coordination of care provided by a team of professionals. Our current system has a serious and growing shortage of these primary care physicians. Today, only 30 percent of physicians provide primary care and 70 percent subspecialize in a single organ system or disease. We need a system in which patients get the right kind of care at the right time in the right place by the right type of provider. They need health services that provide not just convenient hours for minor health problems, but also medical expertise that ensures consistent, ongoing care; accurate diagnoses of symptoms; coordination with pharmacists, other specialists and allied health professionals such as physical therapists; consistent follow-up; and convenience. All at an affordable cost. Several health reform proposals set forth by President Obama and Congress would move federal policy in that direction. How? They incorporate convenience, efficiency, continuity of care and access to a system that relies on the patient-centered medical home -- a concept in which physicians coordinate care with a team of health professionals, offer evening and weekend office hours, and use electronic communication with patients and members of the health care team. But this concept won't be fulfilled unless we have health reform that increases the number of primary care physicians. Right now, America has a current and worsening shortage of primary medical care. Christensen, Hwang and Vijayaraghavan contend that increasing the number of physicians also leads to ""greater intensity of care, but not better health outcomes."" But their argument leaves out a major caveat. Although a greater number of subspecialists does increase the intensity, number and cost of services, research by Barbara Starfield at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health consistently demonstrates the opposite occurs in communities with more primary care physicians, particularly family physicians. Starfield concludes that an increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population resulted in a reduction of 34.6 deaths per 100,000 population at the state level. Katherine Baicker, professor of health economics at Harvard School of Public Health, and Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government confirm these findings. Their research shows that increasing the number of primary care physicians results in a significant increase in the quality of health care and a reduction of cost to patients. However, increasing the number of subspecialists was associated with higher costs and poorer quality. At issue, then, is not the total number of physicians, but the number of family physicians and their primary care colleagues. Demographics, an aging population and resulting increased demand for services will require a significant increase in the number of these physicians. Given the long-term process required to train primary care physicians, we will continue to struggle with a shortage of primary care physicians, and that shortage will affect patients' access to care. Family physicians now are working to fill some of those gaps, according to a 2008 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians. The survey found 42 percent of respondents offer extended office hours and 29 percent provide open access or same-day scheduling. Moreover, 36 percent offer Web-based health information, 32 percent (up from 10 percent two years ago) prescribe medications by e-mail, and 21 percent (up from 18 percent two years ago) offer e-mail interactions. In short, despite the financial disincentives and other barriers in the current system, family physicians are working to meet patients' needs for convenience and access. They are improving this convenience and access with the help of nurses and nurse practitioners, who are excellent sources of care when patients have a known set of conditions and diagnoses that are amenable to treatment protocols. Likewise, walk-in clinics can fill the access gap when patients have an acute problem that requires a treatment that can be spelled out by an accepted protocol. However, even these clinics rely on an adequate number of primary care physicians. Most walk-in clinic staff realize that convenience should not trump quality or continuity, and most will refer patients to a primary care physician for follow-up and ongoing care. Again, without an adequate number of primary care physicians, these patients will have only partial access to the care they need. Family physicians and other primary care providers are part of the solution, not part of the problem. It is important at this critical time of restructuring the health care system to understand clearly what we are trying to accomplish. What we are building is a high-quality, accessible health care system that increases patient satisfaction and health care outcomes while we decrease cost and ethnic disparities. This is what a primary-care based health system will deliver. This is why President Obama and Congress aim to rebuild the U.S. health care system around primary care. This is why we need more primary care physicians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Ted Epperly.",0.6392525,4730
95,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama affirmed his support for a woman's ""right to choose"" on Thursday, the 36th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that led to the legalization of abortion, as thousands of anti-abortion activists descended on the National Mall to challenge his position. President Obama issued a statement defending Roe v. Wade for protecting ""women's health and reproductive freedom."" Roe v. Wade ""not only protects women's health and reproductive freedom, but stands for a broader principle: that government should not intrude on our most private family matters,"" Obama said in a statement. The landmark 1973 decision held that a woman's right to abortion was protected by the right to privacy under the Constitution's 14th Amendment, voiding most state laws against abortion at the time. Nellie Gray, who helped organize the anti-abortion March for Life on the Mall, invited Obama to speak at the rally. ""America needs your strong leadership as president of all the people to stop the intentional killing of an estimated 3,000 pre-born boys and girls each day and the brutalizing of mind, heart and body of pregnant mothers."" Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, said she believes that while abortion should remain an option, increasing the availability and affordability of birth control and reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies is the real solution. ""I think what everyone ought to be interested in doing, whether they are or not, is reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies,"" Gandy told CNN. ""Because if we reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, it will by definition reduce the number of abortions and reduce a lot of the pain and despair that has befallen women in these economic times, who cannot afford to enlarge their families when they don't have a job and they don't have a way to put food on the table for the kids that they have now. ""If we could all work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, it would dramatically change the debate on this issue."" Obama has so far not struck down rules reinstated by the Bush administration eight years ago, prohibiting U.S. money from funding international family planning groups that promote abortion or provide information, counseling or referrals about abortion services. The ""Mexico City policy"" was initially put in place by President Ronald Reagan and suspended during Bill Clinton's presidency. Its opponents refer to it as the ""global gag order."" About 20 anti-abortion rights lawmakers spoke at the rally Thursday, pushing for a renewed effort to overturn Roe v. Wade. ""At what instant does life begin?"" asked Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, focusing on younger crowd members who answered, ""Conception!"" ""And the next question is, "" he continued, ""President Obama, when did your life begin?"" Other legislators detailed their plans to keep the issue on the table in Congress and on the minds of voters. Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio, told the crowd she plans to introduce what she calls the ""Juno Bill,"" referencing the hit 2008 film of the same title in which a high school teenager gives her baby up for adoption. ""It will provide a tax credit to those women, just as we allow abortions to be tax deductible, it will provide a tax credit so that they can carry out their pregnancy, give that baby to a loving arm and not have to worry about the consequences or the costs involved,"" she said. Throughout the rally, speakers urged bold action for their cause. Gandy said the fight will also continue on the pro-abortion rights side. ""There's no question we have a pro-choice president now, but he can't do it alone,"" she said. ""He can't pass legislation. He can't stop what's going on at the state and local level and so the battle rages on ... at the congressional level, at the state and local level and certainly at the Supreme Court."" She said the number of unwanted pregnancies is rising, as congressional action has increased the cost of contraception for college students and low-income women, ""something we hope this administration will reverse."" Two pieces of federal legislation are pending, she said. The first will expand accessibility and availability of birth control, and the second, the Freedom of Choice Act, is a codification of Roe v. Wade. NOW will continue pursuing both at the congressional level, she said, but noted that even though Congress has a Democratic majority, it does not have a pro-abortion rights majority. ""So that will continue to be an uphill battle,"" she said . CNN's Paul Courson and Mary Grace Lucas contributed to this report.",0.6254559,2547
96,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, withdrew his name from consideration as surgeon general of the United States on Thursday. He spoke to CNN's Larry King about the decision and President Obama's health care plans. Here is an edited transcript: . Dr. Sanjay Gupta says he just returned from India, where he looked into medical tourism. Larry King: But, first, breaking news about CNN's own Dr. Sanjay Gupta, long rumored to be the main candidate for U.S. surgeon general. He's taken himself out of the running. Joins us now here in Los Angeles to talk about it. Why? Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Well, first of all, it was a really tough decision, and a long decision and a long process for sure. And I was incredibly flattered, humbled by the consideration even for the position. I think for me it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else. You know, I have two daughters. Our third daughter is now imminent. In fact, I have my phone on right here, I might get called off the set. King: As we talk. Gupta: As we talk, my wife is imminent with our third child. You know, this job that we have collectively takes us away from our children for so many years at once, and I sort of came to grips with the fact that I'd probably be away at least the first several years, four or five years -- there's my existing two daughters, one more on the way -- but several years of their lives. And I just didn't feel like I should do that now. And the other thing, let me just add, you know, you know me and a lot of people know me, obviously, as a journalist for CNN, but you know, I continue to practice neurosurgery, Larry. You and I have talked about that, and I... King: You do brain surgery all the time. Gupta: Yes. And it's an important part of my life. And I work at a county hospital. That's the hospital I've chosen to work at in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I really enjoy that. I came to grips with, ironically, that being surgeon general, I probably would not be able to continue to practice surgery. King: How about the cut in pay? Gupta: Well, you know, that's a sacrifice we were willing to make. I think, you know, either you're a public servant or you're not a public servant. I've always been drawn to public service. So that really wasn't a consideration for me. King: Was it an offer or a ""would you consider if""? Gupta: It's a little bit of a funny thing -- and I've never been through this process before. I guess the formal part of it is when you are nominated. I was not nominated, but I had conversations with the senior-most people that would make an offer, and they told me they wanted me to do this job. So... King: Was it the thought of [Democratic former] Sen. Tom Daschle, who was going to be secretary of health, that you be his surgeon general? Gupta: Well, I did have conversations with him, but you know, the fact that he withdrew did not play as big a role in my mind in terms of not considering the job. Again, I think either you do public service or you don't. You want your job to be as precisely defined as possible, for sure, but that wasn't a major factor. King: The way it was presented, then, you feel that you would have been offered it even if Daschle had not left or had left, no matter what? Gupta: I think so. You know, I mean, you know, I've had a lot of conversations with the White House folks. I think there was a big interest on their part, and obviously they know of my dedication to public service. I think there was a real melding there. King: Do you have anyone you would recommend for that job? Gupta: You know, no one off the top of my head. I mean, I think whoever takes that job really does have to make it a higher-profile job. I mean, this is an important job. I have a great deal of respect for the office and for the commissioned corps. You've seen the work they do. They do life-saving... King: A lot of clout. Gupta: Yes, a lot of clout, life-saving, life-preventing work -- or life-preserving work -- all over the country every single day. And I think that it has to have a little bit of a higher profile. Whoever takes this job has to be out there really advocating the issues of public health. At no time is it probably more important than right now, as we're dealing with health care reform. These issues really go hand in hand. King: Well, their loss is a continuing our gain. Gupta: I appreciate that. King: If I may speak to it. Gupta: I would miss this witty banter for sure, back and forth. King: May I speak for CNN. But you had to be flattered. Gupta: I was flattered. And you know, I have a great deal of respect for that office. And I in no way want people to think that I don't. This is really more about my family and my surgical career. King: Couple other notes. I know you're just back from India. I want to ask about that. Gupta: Yes. King: President Obama held a health care summit [Thursday] at the White House. More than 100 experts, policy makers took part, including some who opposed the Clinton administration's health care reform back in the '90s. Do you support his aims? Gupta: He is drawing an inextricable relationship between the economy and health care. As people talk -- the economy is issue No. 1, as we talk about all the time. But he's making the point, I think, and he has been for some time, even while he was campaigning, that you cannot talk about the economy without talking about health care. The businesses have to provide health care insurance for their employees. It is often very difficult for them to do that, in addition to trying to reach some sort of profit from their product. So I -- that message, I think, has been pretty loud and clear, and I think it is resonating. He's also talking about the fact that you can't fix the health care system without bringing down costs of health care overall. And since you brought it up, I was just in India, and one of the stories that I was doing was about medical tourism. Here is a good example -- 750,000 Americans leave the United States every year to go abroad for life-saving operations. Why? Mainly because of cost. It can be up to a tenth of the cost in some of these countries such as India, such as Singapore. King: Open-heart surgery in India might be one-tenth of what it costs here? Gupta: One-tenth. Hip surgery, neurosurgery. All -- a lot of these various operations. And the real question, and I think it's a question worth exploring, is why? How can they do it so much cheaper? How can they offer good-quality care? I saw it. It is good-quality care. I saw that with my own eyes. What do we have to learn? And how can we use this to help reform our health care system? King: Is there an assumption that we have the best doctors, that we do it better than anybody else, that's an American assumption? Gupta: Yes. And I think, you know, we do provide very good health care for people who have access to it. King: Ah. Gupta: And I think that's part of the problem. King: That's the rub, though, right? Gupta: That is the rub. And I think there are really two schools of thought, which we are going to hopefully distill down, as we talk about this issue more and more. One is, do you revamp the entire health care system? Do you say, look, this health care system is broken, toss it all out, let's start all over again? Or do you say, look, it works pretty well for a fraction of the population. Let's see who it doesn't work for and fix those things only. So don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Let's target what's broken and focus on that. King: What role in all of this will the new surgeon general play? Gupta: I really don't know. I'm not sure. At one point... King: He would have to be a proponent for it, you would think. Gupta: You know, the surgeon general has an interesting position, and this is something that I learned. It is truly one of the more apolitical positions at that senior level. So they are really the nation's doctor. I think that they really have to focus on making sure that best health practices are constantly known. It's amazing how high the health illiteracy rate remains in this country. To remind people how to best take care of themselves. King: One other thing. Do you think it's going to -- do you think we're going to get a new health care program? Gupta: I think so. It's going to take a long time. I think that it may not even happen within this first term, if there is a second term for him. So I think it's not going to be something that happens certainly overnight. The fact that they had a health care summit this early on I think is probably a good sign of at least his commitment to this issue.",0.62469494,3630
97,"Washington (CNN) -- At the end of his career, former House Speaker Tip O'Neill was asked how Congress had changed between the 1950s and 1980s. O'Neill answered: ""The people are better. The results are worse."" Watching last week's health summit, you see what O'Neill meant. The conversation was intelligent, civil, well-informed. It also predictably achieved nothing. How could it? Deals are never reached in front of the television camera. Take this quiz. Name the most important legislation enacted in the 30 years between 1950 and 1980. Overwhelming isn't it? Civil rights. Voting rights. Interstate highways. Medicare. Medicaid. The deregulation of the airlines, natural gas, trucking, rail and oil. The immigration act of 1965. Clean Air, Clean Water, and the Endangered Species Acts. Supplemental Security Income in 1974. I could fill the whole screen. Now ... the next 30 years. There's the Reagan tax cuts of course. Deregulation of the savings & loans in 1982. The Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Welfare reform in 1995. Medicare Part D. What else? Leave aside whether you are liberal or conservative, whether you approve the measures mentioned above or disapprove. It's hard to dispute: Congress just got a lot more done in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s than in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Why? You hear many grand, sweeping explanations. Let's try just one simple one. Congress in the first period was controlled by a handful of committee chairmen, who owed their positions to seniority. The committees did their work in secret. Bills written in committee typically could not be amended on the floor of Congress. The institution was authoritarian, hierarchical, opaque. And stuff passed. In the mid-1970s, Congress underwent a revolution. The power of the committee chairmen was broken. The number of subcommittees proliferated. The committees met in public. Amendments multiplied. Congress become more open, more egalitarian, more responsive. And stuff ceased to pass. Again and again, today's gridlock can be traced to yesterday's reform. Is the filibuster grinding Congress to a halt? Before the 1970s, filibusters were both very rare and very difficult. But when Congress took action to make filibusters easier to break, it inadvertently made them easier to use. Back in the 1950s, a filibuster would bring the entire Senate to a halt, as the filibustering Senator talked and talked and talked. A filibuster was both spectacularly visible and personally exhausting: it exacted a high price from the filibustering senator. Then Congress took action to make filibusters easier to break, requiring only 60 votes instead of 67. But that same deal made them much easier to start. No need to speechify all night; no colleagues enraged that the filibustering senator has paralyzed the chamber. Today, a filibustering senator need only notify the majority leader of his intention. The filibustered legislation is sidetracked until 60 votes are found to enact it, while other business continues as normal. The price of the filibuster has been drastically cut. No surprise we get more of them. Candidates consumed by fundraising? Two generations ago, candidates barely raised money at all. Once nominated, a candidate would turn to his party apparatus to provide the money and expertise needed to contest an election. But the maximum contribution by a party organization was capped in the 1940s, and it has not been raised significantly since. This cap was supposed to clean up politics by weakening party bosses. Instead, it has forced every individual member of Congress to spend the bulk of his or her time begging for funds -- the very opposite of clean politics. Lobbyists everywhere? In 1950, a lobbyist who wanted a tax measure would have very few targets. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee could help, ditto the ranking member of the opposition party. The senior members of the Senate Finance Committee would likewise be worth talking to. Maybe some of the upper level officials at Treasury. The days of concentrated power have ended. Today, almost any one of the 535 members of Congress could help -- and so of course the interests must employ many more lobbyists to woo them all. Congress utterly polarized? Once upon a time, members of Congress did their business mostly in secret. They struck quiet  deals with each other. A Republican might support a Democratic labor measure in return for some discreet help with a farm bill. Today, everything happens in the bright glare of sunshine, policed by hundreds of ideological interest groups. Deviate one step from the party line, and you are a traitor, a sell-out, an enemy. Just ask Scott Brown, yesterday's Republican hero, today a villain for voting against the filibuster of a jobs bill. We have an ideology that more publicity, more transparency, more openness must improve Congress. And when each successive wave of openness makes things worse, we tell ourselves that the answer is even more publicity, transparency and openness still. No contrary evidence makes any impression. Seems like everything's open -- except our minds. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.",0.6227054,9847
98,"(CNN) -- Seven states and two organizations have sued the Bush administration in an attempt to block a federal regulation that would further protect health care workers who refuse to perform abortions or other medical procedures because of religious or moral reasons. A rule protecting the rights of health care providers who refuse to participate in certain procedures is under fire. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal filed a lawsuit Thursday on behalf of his state, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island. Blumenthal said the regulation would put women's health care at risk and would undercut state contraception laws. ""On its way out, the Bush administration has left a ticking legal time bomb set to explode literally the day of the inaugural and blow apart vital constitutional rights and women's health care,"" Blumenthal said in a statement. ""Women's health may be endangered -- needlessly and unlawfully -- if this rule is allowed to stand."" He said the regulation ""intentionally shrouds"" abortion in ""new and unnecessary ambiguity,"" encouraging individuals to define it and to ""deny virtually all forms of contraceptions, even emergency contraception to rape victims."" The Planned Parenthood Federation of America and American Civil Liberties Union, which was acting on behalf of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, also filed separate suits Thursday. The Department of Health and Human Services said the regulation would allow the federal government to withhold federal funds for state and local governments, health plans and health care facilities that do not follow existing federal laws that ban discrimination against doctors and other health workers who refuse to participate in procedures such as sterilizations or abortions or to make referrals for such procedures. ""We have not had an opportunity to review the lawsuits and we will respond to the court on any pending litigation,"" department spokeswoman Rebecca Ayers said in an e-mail. ""The department followed appropriate procedures to put the regulation in place and the regulation is fully supported by law."" The department promulgated the rule last month. ""Doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt said in a statement then. ""This rule protects the right of medical providers to care for their patients in accord with their conscience."" The department has said that it believes the public and health care providers are unaware of the federal anti-discrimination laws. ""Many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice -- often in direct opposition to their personal convictions,"" said the department's assistant secretary of health, Adm. Joxel Garcia, in a statement in December. ""During my practice as an OB-GYN, I witnessed this firsthand. Health care providers shouldn't have to check their consciences at the hospital door. Fortunately, Congress enacted several laws to that end, but too many are unaware these protections exist.""",0.62240034,4675
99,"(CNN) -- It's bad enough to be sick and miserable. But adding insult to injury for many a patient is having to hack through a veritable jungle of often-confusing paperwork to make health insurance claims. Dr. Val Jones is part of a practice in Virginia that has lowered its fees and quit taking insurance. Consumers' frustrations with health insurance paperwork are well-known. But it's also a frustrating tangle for doctors and their staffs. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman has a report about one innovative practice that has decided to take on the insurance paperwork monster -- by completely avoiding it. Dr. Val Jones joined a small practice, DocTalker Family Medicine in Vienna, Virginia, where the doctors do not even take insurance. They charge a simple, relatively low fee for each service. That's it. The doctors at DocTalker grew tired of seeing patients struggle with baffling insurance paperwork while both their health and wealth were on the line. ""They don't know why they're getting these questions asked,""  Jones said. ""They don't know what the forms mean. And ... their compensation is dependent on it."" This innovation has been good news for Carol ""Yogi"" Yogan of McClain, Virginia. She said she broke her wrist ice skating, and her insurance company initially told her that her injury would not be covered. After persistent effort, she eventually convinced them otherwise. The company paid. But Yogan is certain without her dogged efforts, her claim would have been forever lost in the ""paperwork jungle"" of the insurance trade.  Watch Yogan's struggle with bureaucratic red tape » . Yogi Yogan has pretty much lost all faith in insurance companies. She has enough insurance to cover a catastrophic illness, but for routine care, she's now going to that nearby fee-for-service medical office where Jones works. ""It's seamless,"" Yogan said. She knows precisely what she is getting and what it costs. Jones does not believe the insurance industry set out to cultivate the paperwork jungle. She thinks it just grew over time. But now that it is there, she suspects they are making so much money off of it, that there is no real incentive to clear it up. Former insurance industry executive Wendell Potter agrees. He said one way insurers make money is by allowing confusion to reign. ""And people often just give up,"" Potter said, ""and don't pursue payment when a claim has been denied or been paid inappropriately or not adequately. And the same is true with doctors and hospitals."" He believes billions of dollars are at stake. The insurance industry, while acknowledging the existence of the paperwork jungle, denies it is a trap for extra profits. Robert Zirkilbach is with a national trade association for insurers called America's Health Insurance Plans. ""The health insurance industry is one of the most regulated industries in America, and particularly at the state level there are all kinds of requirements of information that needs to be provided to patients in paper and through the mail,"" Zirkilbach said. But he adds, insurers are just as worried as customers about the confusion that causes. ""We agree that reform is needed. In fact, that's why we've been working very hard to develop reforms to make the system more efficient,"" Zirkilbach said. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman contributed to this report.",0.6109443,8008
100,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama is planning to sign an executive order Monday to overturn Bush-era policy that limited federal tax dollars for embryonic stem cell research, according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations. President Obama will overturn Bush policy on embryonic stem cell research, administration officials say. Obama's move will be hailed by advocates for those suffering from a host of afflictions, ranging from diabetes to Parkinson's disease, who believe that an expansion of stem-cell research could boost medical progress toward eradicating the debilitating diseases. But many conservatives object to the destruction of human embryos because they contend that it ends a human life. The officials said the administration is planning a Monday event at the White House at which Obama will overturn the executive order signed by President George W. Bush in August 2001. It barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time.  Interactive: Unlocking the promise of stem cells » . Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council accused the White House of leaking the details Friday night so that the move gets little attention, declaring that it is ""a slap in the face to Americans who believe in the dignity of all human life."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said, ""Advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington, D.C., and breakthroughs announced in recent years confirm the full potential of stem cell research can be realized without the destruction of living human embryos."" In addition to signing the executive order, Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research. At the time, Bush also argued that scientific advances allowed researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos. Bush's moves led to Democratic charges that he had put politics over science.",0.6014598,4884
101,"(OPRAH.com) -- The recession has millions of consumers spending less, saving more and paying off debt. The fact that we are adjusting to the reality of this economy is good news, to be sure. There are items in any budget that can be scaled back easily. Financial expert Jean Chatzky warns there are items you should not cut out of your budget. But there's some spending areas where you shouldn't budge. Retirement planning . The Pension Rights Center counted about 20 corporations in December that announced changes to their 401(k) plans. Many others have discontinued or downsized their traditional pension plans. If your company is still offering matching dollars, you should keep kicking in money to grab them. ""To get that free money from your employer is so important for the long-term growth of your retirement nest egg. Especially now, with the down market, when you're dollar-cost averaging in at lower prices, that free money has more value in the long run,"" said Derek Kennedy, a financial planner in Cincinnati. If your company has cut back, it still pays to contribute. Also consider an Individual Retirement Account. You can get your money out any time and, after five years, use it without penalty for a first-time home purchase. Insurance . Don't cut your homeowners insurance thinking that because home values have dropped you don't need as much coverage. What you're paying for is the amount it would cost to rebuild your home and replace your belongings. If you need to save, boost your policy's deductible. Raising it to $1,000 from $500 could shave 25 percent off the cost. Exercise . Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota just completed a study that found that people who go to the gym at least eight times a month have significantly lower health costs than those who don't. You can get those same benefits by going for a brisk walk, running or riding a bike or by spending less than the cost of a monthly gym membership on a pair of dumbbells. Healthcare . Some cuts are fine -- generic drugs instead of name brand, for instance. But skipping doctor visits is a bad idea, and so is canceling your insurance. ""I've seen so many people go through horrendous financial nightmares and even bankruptcy because they don't have health insurance. This is just not one you want to mess with,"" said Jonni McCoy, author of ""Miserly Moms: Living Well on Less in a Tough Economy."" Charity . Giving to others can make you feel better about yourself and your situation. If money is tight, donate items you no longer use, give canned goods, shop at thrift stores that benefit a charity or share some of your time. Oprah.com: Five steps to secure your financial future .

103,"(CNN) -- Filmmaker Michael Moore, whose new documentary ""Sicko"" takes on America's health care system, faced off Tuesday with CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Michael Moore and CNN's Sanjay Gupta argued Tuesday about Gupta's report on Moore's film ""Sicko"" Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko."" ""He said the facts were fudged,"" Moore said, referring to Gupta, on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""That's a lie. None of the facts are fudged."" Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used. Moore said his staffers backed up the film's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong. Gupta disputed that.  Watch Moore, Gupta make their points » . ""We try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find,"" he said. ""Michael has a lot of different numbers. ... You're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports."" Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of ""Sicko"": Problems abound in America's health-care system and need to be fixed. ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that,"" Gupta said. ""I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it's broken. We get it."" He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue. However, Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care --suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that ""Sicko"" audiences might not realize. Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays, deductibles and insurance premiums. ""We [America] have a system built on profit,"" the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. ""It's a shameful system, especially when I'm dealing with some of my patients,"" Gupta said. But he questioned Moore's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration, which Moore fiercely criticized in the past, particularly in his film ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" ""The government actually used to do things right,"" Moore said in response. ""The problem is who we put in power."" Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war's success abounded in Washington. ""I am sorry we've taken so much time trying to correct [Gupta's] facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue"" -- the ailing health care system, Moore said.

104,"(CNN) -- Millions of poor American children have untreated tooth decay, some of them because they cannot find a dentist willing to treat them, a federal report issued Tuesday said. Only 1 in 3 children in Medicaid received any dental care over a year time span, according to a new report. ""Dental disease remains a significant problem for children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid,"" the U.S. Government Accountability Office report concluded, referring to the federal/state health program for poor people. According to the report, which used data from 1999 to 2004, about 6.5 million children enrolled in Medicaid had untreated tooth decay in 2005 and were nearly twice as likely as children with private health insurance to have untreated tooth decay. The GAO report was ordered after widespread publicity of the case of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy boy who died last year in suburban Washington when an untreated infected tooth led to a brain infection. Driver ""had extensive dental disease and his family was unable to find a dentist to treat him,"" the report said. The report said 14.8 percent of Medicaid recipients said their children had not gotten necessary dental care because their dentist refused to accept Medicaid, which typically pays providers less than private insurers. ""Clearly, the oral health care system failed this young man,"" said Dr. Jane S. Grover, first vice president of the American Dental Association in testimony Tuesday to the Committee on House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Domestic Policy. ""All of us -- practitioners, payers, parents and policymakers -- need to come together and make the system work for the most vulnerable among us,"" she said. The report found that, nationwide, only one in three children in Medicaid had received any dental care in the year before the survey was carried out, and one in eight reportedly had never seen a dentist. In comparison, more than half of children with private health insurance had gotten dental care during the prior year. ""Fundamental changes to the Medicaid program are long overdue to prevent the possibility of future tragedies like Deamonte and to ensure that all low-income children have the same access to oral health care services enjoyed by the majority of Americans,"" Grover said. Efforts are under way to fix the problem. She cited plans to open eight dental schools in addition to the 57 currently in existence and said a new job -- community dental health coordinator -- has been created. The coordinators will be trained to work in clinics and schools to ensure emergency care is provided to children, she said. ""If there had been a CDHC in the school that Deamonte Driver attended, we believe this tragedy could have been prevented,"" she said. ""Through a routine exam, a CDHC could have spotted a simple cavity, filled the cavity with a temporary filling, and made arrangements for care by a dentist,"" she said. The CDHC will also help families enroll in Medicaid and get transportation to appointments, she said. But even if the numbers of dentists increase, Congress must act to increase fees for those participating in Medicaid to match private rates, she said.",0.5637632,1183
105,"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- After a town hall meeting on health-care reform in Belgrade, Montana, President Obama will escape to Big Sky country on Friday evening where he'll spend time with family and go fly-fishing for the first time. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel carries fly-fishing tackle  to Marine One on Friday. Fly-fishing requires a singular focus, much like golf. Having newly discovered the sport myself, it occurred to me as I watched Marine One lift off the South Lawn on Friday that there are probably some lessons on the river that could apply to Obama's presidency. Thinking like a producer, I called an expert -- fly-fishing instructor Tony Derosier, who described the evolution most fishermen go through. ""Usually, when you first go fishing, all you want to do is catch a fish, and then all you want to do is catch a lot of fish, and then you just want to catch the larger fish. After you've caught a lot of large fish, you kind of go back to square one and catch just one fish,"" said Derosier, manager at Taylor Creek Fly Shop in Aspen, Colorado. ""You basically just want to go fishing -- the numbers, the size, it doesn't matter any more."" Obama is in the ""big fish"" stage of his presidency: He's trying to get health-care reform legislation passed hook, line, and sinker. If he's successful, anything else he gets passed will be icing on the cake. Learning the fundamentals of fly-fishing can serve as a metaphor for health care reform. Obama just needs to look at hooking and landing Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans like he would trout. The first step -- learn how to cast. ""Fly-casting is all about maximizing the energy you put in your rod and you lose energy if you wait too long,"" Derosier said. ""And conversely, if you don't wait long enough, your line will crack like a whip."" Obama has to strike the right balance between rushing things through and losing momentum; and maintaining support while bringing others over to his side. The second step -- reading the water: ""Instead of blindly casting anywhere in the river you want to understand where you might find fish,"" Derosier explained. Obama zeroed in on a fairly conservative state, Montana, where he faces a land full of skeptics about his health care reform plan. Third -- hook and land the fish: Derosier said once you hook the fish you have to know how to play the fish, which is a delicate balance between applying pressure but not so much that the line breaks -- much like the delicate balance of Obama's courting members of Congress. ""The ultimate goal is to gain an advantage over the fish so that you can land him,"" he said. ""It's the hardest thing to teach when it comes to fly-fishing,"" he said. Out in Montana, the game is catch-and-release trout. But in Washington, Obama is trying to hook Congress and take home health care reform, or risk it being the big one that got away.",0.5406015,5677

108,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Power-driven wheelchairs are costing Medicare and its beneficiaries nearly four times what suppliers pay for them, and competitive bidding could have reduced those costs, according to an inspector general's report released Wednesday. Competitive bidding would have cut costs on a standard power wheelchair by nearly $1,000, the report says. A standard power wheelchair costs the federal health insurance program for seniors an average of $4,018 to lease, compared with $1,048 for suppliers to buy, the Department of Health and Human Services' internal watchdog reported. ""Medicare and its beneficiaries paid suppliers an average of $2,970 beyond the supplier's acquisition cost to perform an average of five services and cover general business costs,"" the report found. The difference was not as dramatic for more advanced wheelchairs used for physical rehabilitation patients, but at an average lease of $11,507, those chairs still cost Medicare about twice as much as the $5,880 paid by suppliers, the report found. More than 173,000 Medicare beneficiaries received power wheelchairs in the first half of 2007, at a cost of about $686 million, the report said. The cost could have been reduced considerably had Congress not delayed a planned system of competitive bidding for what Medicare classifies as ""durable medical equipment,"" such as wheelchairs and oxygen tanks, the report said. Competitive bidding would have cut Medicare's average cost of a standard power wheelchair by nearly $1,000, the inspector general found. ""Medicare and beneficiary payments under the Competitive Bidding Acquisition Program would have decreased by an average of 26 percent across all included categories of [durable medical equipment], saving up to an estimated $1 billion annually,"" the report found. ""However, Congress delayed the program and exempted complex rehabilitation power wheelchairs from future competitive bidding."" Medicare's annual budget for 2008 was $444 billion. In January, it cut its payments to suppliers by 9.5 percent to make up for what it thought competitive bidding would have saved taxpayers, according to the report. In July, a CNN investigation found that a patient and taxpayers were billed about $1,200 over four years for a nonmotorized chair, while a nearly identical chair could be bought from the same supplier for $349. The issue has become controversial as the Obama administration tries to overhaul the U.S. health care system and rein in the cost of Medicare. Administration officials want to require competitive bids for items such as wheelchairs. But the American Association for Homecare, which represents many in the durable equipment industry, said the bidding program would reduce patient choice, limit access to home medical care and drive up Medicare costs by requiring more hospital stays.",0.51537347,9963

BUPA began as The British United Provident Association in 1947 to preserve freedom of choice in health care. It believed that with a National Health Service being introduced a year later, there would still be a need for a complimentary service enabling people from all walks of life to afford the benefits of choice in where, when and by whom they were treated. Led by the growing public demand for health care and a lack of quality private accommodation BUPA initiated the Nuffield Homes Charitable Trust - later renamed Nuffield Hospitals.
